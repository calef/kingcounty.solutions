  <h2 class="wp-block-heading">The VA Home Telehealth Program in West Texas helps Veterans stay connected</h2>



  <p>The West Texas VA Health Care System’s Remote Patient Monitoring Program and <a href="https://news.va.gov/?s=TeleHealth+">Telehealth</a> program isn&#8217;t just about convenience—it’s about making health care accessible to those who served.</p>



  <p>Using technology to monitor Veterans&#8217; health at home daily, VA offers Remote Patient Monitoring and Home Telehealth (RPM-HT) to provide care for chronic conditions like diabetes, heart failure and COPD.</p>



  <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Under the hood: What RPM-HT looks like</h2>



  <p>Veterans enrolled in these programs receive essential monitoring equipment—blood pressure cuffs, glucose monitors (including continuous glucose monitoring), scales, A1C trackers and more—all provided by VA. Each morning (or as instructed), Veterans log their readings, which are transmitted to their care team.</p>



  <p>This isn’t passive data collection. Staff monitor trends in real time, ready to spot early warning signs and collaborate across the Veteran’s care team to respond before conditions escalate.</p>



  <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Proven outcomes: Data speaks volumes</h2>



  <p>The impact of RPM-HT isn’t theoretical—it’s measurable. Across VA, Veterans in the program experienced a 41% reduction in hospital admissions and a 70% reduction in bed-days of care. These aren&#8217;t just numbers; they translate to avoided crises, hospital visits and an improved quality of life.</p>



  <p>Additional historical data supports a&nbsp;53% decrease in VA bed days&nbsp;and&nbsp;33% fewer hospital admissions&nbsp;among RPM enrollees, alongside patient satisfaction scores hovering around&nbsp;90%. Such outcomes reflect the program’s proactive, preventative nature—catching trouble before it becomes an emergency.</p>



  <h2 class="wp-block-heading">The human touch: Behind the tech</h2>



  <p>The numbers matter, but so do the people delivering care. Dianna Ybarra, one of five telehealth RNs at WTVAHCS, is central to the program’s success. “We look at every WTVAHCS patient to find those who could benefit from this service, and by collaborating with our Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT), we&#8217;re able to enroll the Veterans who could benefit most from this program,” she explained. Her dedication ensures the right Veterans are supported—with empathy as well as technology.</p>



  <p>“Equally as important is that our PACT understand what the program offers, and how both they and their Veterans can benefit from it,” said TeleHealth Program Manager Shelbi Vaughn. “This not only provides better health care outcomes for our Veterans, but it also supports our PACT by giving them daily insight into the health of our most vulnerable patients. With that information, they can act quickly, adjust care plans as needed and ensure Veterans get faster access to the right care at the right time.”</p>



  <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Transforming rural care—one home at a time</h2>



  <p>In an area spanning 33 counties across 53,000 square miles, WTVAHCS serves more than 56,000 Veterans, of whom about 17,000 (30%) receive care through the system, accounting for over 170,000 outpatient visits annually. Since inpatient services ceased in 2013, WTVAHCS has evolved into a beacon of outpatient and telehealth care innovation, offering services ranging from mental health and dietetics to prosthetics and specialty consultations.</p>



  <p>Within this vast landscape, RPM-HT isn’t optional—it’s essential. It brings serious health monitoring to doorsteps, equips Veterans with daily oversight and fosters deeper patient education, empowering Veterans to take charge of their health and avoid unnecessary hospitalizations.</p>



  <h2 class="wp-block-heading">A system rooted in reach and resilience</h2>



  <p>WTVAHCS spans a huge geographical area, delivering outpatient-focused care through a robust telehealth infrastructure. Anchored by the George H.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is enhancing its telehealth program to improve healthcare access for veterans. This initiative, called "Bridging Distances," aims to break down geographical barriers, allowing veterans to receive care from their homes. The program leverages technology to connect veterans with healthcare providers, ensuring they have access to essential services regardless of their location.

Telehealth services include video visits, remote patient monitoring, and mental health support, all designed to cater to the unique needs of veterans. By providing these services, the VA seeks to reduce travel time and costs for veterans, especially those in rural or underserved areas. The program has seen significant growth, with millions of telehealth visits conducted over the past year.

Veterans have reported positive experiences with telehealth, citing convenience and increased access to healthcare professionals. The VA continues to invest in telehealth technology and infrastructure, aiming to expand services and ensure that all veterans can benefit from high-quality care from the comfort of their homes. This initiative represents a significant step toward modernizing veteran healthcare and addressing the challenges posed by distance and accessibility.
