  Bazzi (<u>00:07</u>):</p>\n<p>Hello and welcome to the Appetite, a podcast brought
  to you by Opal Food and Body Wisdom, an eating disorder treatment clinic in Seattle,
  Washington. It is a podcast about all things food, body movement, and mental health.
  I&#8217;m Kara Bazzi, a co-founder and clinical director for Opal, a licensed marriage
  and family therapist, as well as your host for today. So welcome to today&#8217;s
  episode. I&#8217;m excited to be joined by Nikki Wolf, one of the incredible therapists
  at Opal and Nikki specializes in family and relationship therapy, working closely
  with clients to explore how relationships can both contribute to the life force
  of an eating disorder and serve as a powerful resource for healing. She also leads
  groups at Opal focused on these dynamics, helping individuals navigate the complexities
  of connection with others and recovery as someone who shares a deep passion for
  family and relationship therapy. I&#8217;m really looking forward to this conversation,
  so let&#8217;s dive in. Welcome Nikki.</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>01:07</u>):</p>\n<p>Thank
  you. I&#8217;m excited to be here.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>01:10</u>):</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m
  excited to have you. So I would love to start just by giving listeners a little
  bit of background information on you, how you came to be interested in doing the
  work of eating disorders, and in particular the family and relationship work. This
  is a part of the work that a lot of people are intimidated by of doing the family
  system work, so I&#8217;d love to hear how you got here.</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>01:36</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah,
  so eating disorders, I have a young adult child daughter, and when she was in high
  school and an adolescent, I became very aware of the prevalence of disordered eating
  among her peers. It wasn&#8217;t necessarily at that time I felt like I need to
  go work in this field. This is my second career as you know, I was working as an
  acupuncturist before it was when I was in grad school. I found Opal and your approach,
  Opal&#8217;s approach, at least from the R-O-D-B-T perspective was new to me and
  it was really exciting and inspiring and I knew I wanted to be a part of it. So
  it was kind of a slow burn. The family systems piece that&#8217;s very personal
  to me. I&#8217;ve done a lot of work personally around my family of origin, working
  with my husband and his family of origin, and it&#8217;s been a really powerful
  journey to healing my current relationships, how I show up in my relationships now,
  understanding that systems piece from my childhood and my own relationship with
  my family. So there&#8217;s been a lot of healing for me in that and I just really
  want to be a part of that for others and give others that opportunity to change
  how they&#8217;re showing up in their relationships.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>03:07</u>):</p>\n<p>Cool.
  Yeah, I think of how I know who our listeners are, even if we haven&#8217;t had
  our own personal experience with an eating disorder or disordered eating, most of
  us have been in relationship with somebody who struggled in this way. So I would
  love for you to talk a little bit more about your experience in working with loved
  ones with parents, spouses, partners, roommates, friends, what have you typically
  experienced as the loved ones? Posture towards the person struggling with an eating
  disorder. And I guess I would also want to say to give some context, we do family
  and relationship therapy at Opal and we have historically served clients that are
  18 and older now we are taking clients from 16 years and older, but we have worked
  with most of our clients who are no longer living with their family of families
  of origin or at home, but we have had that be an integral part of our treatment
  and most of our clients have participated in this family relationship work. So I
  think that&#8217;s something unique to Opal that we&#8217;ve done adult treatment
  and then had this regular consistency with family therapy. And so I would love to
  just have you share what do you typically, what do you see when you&#8217;re in
  the room with these loved ones?</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>04:30</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah,
  there&#8217;s a huge educational component a lot of times, particularly with support
  people who are new to the eating disorder and recovery journey. A lot of what can
  I do to fix this? I would say if I had to pick a number one theme, the question
  how do I best support my loved one usually means how do I problem solve or fix this?
  And the education comes in with the Tuesday night group or in individual sessions,
  it&#8217;s more about that direct communication and maybe talking about the eating
  disorder directly or what the needs are within the system, how the family is working
  together, whether it&#8217;s teenager or adult with a partner coming in or roommates.
  We see all kinds of dynamics in Opal and that&#8217;s the one I think that we probably
  talk the most about, at least in the beginning. And there&#8217;s a lot of trepidation
  to go into uncovering patterns and talking about really uncomfortable stuff that
  might come up in the family session or the relationship therapy session. And so
  there is some building rapport, doing some education around eating disorders. What
  does family systems therapy look like? What does relationship therapy look like?
  It could look different ways. And then I would also say bumping up against support
  people&#8217;s own biases about what is an eating disorder, how to address it, and
  their own relationship with food and bodies and potentially disordered eating. That
  does show up a lot. Role of communication. That is a huge one too.</p>\n<p>Kara
  Bazzi (<u>06:22</u>):</p>\n<p>So you&#8217;re saying that maybe the posture of trepidation
  some concern, but the posture of what can I do to fix this quote problem that a
  lot of support people come in with. And what, I guess just to make sure the listeners
  are understanding what, can you say more about that dynamic of how we might address
  that posture of this fixing? Is that what we&#8217;re doing? Are we telling the
  support people what they can do to fix this eating disorder or how might we be addressing
  that very common way of showing up to treatment to start with?</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf
  (<u>07:03</u>):</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a great question. Typically, no, we&#8217;re
  not encouraging fixing it might. So I&#8217;m thinking about a family that I worked
  with and it was parents and a young adult. And I would say that this is a very common
  pattern to see with parents who are supporting people in our program because as
  a parent, it&#8217;s really hard, and I mean as a person in relationship, it&#8217;s
  hard to see our loved one struggling and in pain. And as a parent it can have its
  own set of challenges. And so it&#8217;s kind of maybe uncovering what if you can&#8217;t
  fix it, what&#8217;s the emotion driving that? There&#8217;s a lot of helplessness
  that comes in, a lot of acceptance around, well, this journey might look a lot different
  than I had hoped. And so my intent is to dig in to authentic communication around
  that and emotional expression, like open expression of emotion. We don&#8217;t always
  get there in the time that we have and that&#8217;s okay, but maybe introducing
  a new way of thinking about supporting your loved one might not be about problem
  solving or fixing or tell me about your day. I want to know everything. It might
  be, God, that sounds really hard. That&#8217;s bringing up a lot for me. What do
  I need to do to care for my own process in this?</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>08:51</u>):</p>\n<p>Which
  when I hear you say that, I hear maybe for example, instead of fixing, you might
  be helping loved ones learn how to validate what&#8217;s happening for the other
  person and maybe working on caring for their own needs of what&#8217;s coming up
  in relationship with the person, for example. So that could be a different way of
  helping and supporting the healing of a system versus what can they do or say to
  fix the eating disorder.</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>09:18</u>):</p>\n<p>Absolutely.
  I think the parallel process of learning that support people are doing is really
  important. And I think it&#8217;s also very meaningful to the clients who are in
  treatment and doing that own learning and examining of self and potentially getting
  their own help through therapy or support groups. That&#8217;s a lot of the feedback
  we do get in the Tuesday family relationship therapy support group is just how valuable
  it is for the support people to learn these new ways of being in relationship and
  practice it and potentially get closer to their loved one.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>10:01</u>):</p>\n<p>It
  makes me think of what so often happens in family therapy or family and relationship
  therapy is the loved ones might come in with a certain idea or expectation of what
  the work could look like and it&#8217;s not matching what that is. And some systems
  might feel resistant to that difference or welcome it be open, flexible. But I just
  think of, yeah, it&#8217;s often not where people might think the starting point
  is that it goes in a different direction of what the actual work of healing could
  be within that system.</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>10:37</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah, I mean the
  thinking sometimes they&#8217;ll come into the session and it&#8217;s a very heady,
  let&#8217;s logistically talk about this very rational, but your loved one has a
  need, has an emotional need that&#8217;s not being met. And so how can we start
  to communicate about that? So it&#8217;s also not just about the client that&#8217;s
  in our program. I try to be pretty clear when I start working with couples and different
  relationships, families, that the family is my client. We&#8217;re not, even though
  our client is in programming with us, if in the family relationship therapy setting,
  the family is the client and we&#8217;re there to talk about and to discover dynamics
  in that system, not just what the client is bringing with their eating disorder.</p>\n<p>Kara
  Bazzi (<u>11:39</u>):</p>\n<p>And maybe we could talk a little bit about, I know
  you touched on this, but what are other things that we might be addressing in those
  systems and those sessions? Because what we&#8217;re kind of addressing in those
  patterns in the system, and I know when I&#8217;ve been in that role, a family and
  relationship therapist, I am looking for patterns that these relationships have
  been stuck in and looking for ways to disrupt and to experiment and try things new
  and often it lands in the realm of communication, expression of feelings and what
  others, what other things? I think of what we just said earlier, the validation,
  learning, teaching people the skills of listening, again, not fixing. So that might
  be, we sometimes bring in this skill we call the move skill, which is about learning
  how to slow down, listen, validate and empathize, and really give people full turn
  to be able to do that in the moment of a heated conflict and then take turns doing
  it and really slowing someone down to try something different. And oftentimes the
  family therapist can be so useful because we can disrupt these patterns and give
  a timeout and try something different. So what else would you say in that vein?
  Are things that you&#8217;re doing in the room that would be common, things you&#8217;re
  disrupting or introducing that these relationships hadn&#8217;t experienced yet?</p>\n<p>Nikki
  Wolf (<u>13:14</u>):</p>\n<p>I mean, everything you just said about disrupting,
  I&#8217;m like, yes, I do that. That&#8217;s my primary goal. And that I would say
  when there&#8217;s a lot of trauma in either with one person in the room or both
  people in the room, there&#8217;s something that happens when conflict starts or
  disagreement or an argument that tends to happen over and over again where I&#8217;ve
  seen clients kind of revert back to their wounded self or the trauma self. And so
  we might be, I would say observation is my main job. I&#8217;m observing what&#8217;s
  happening. I actually really like it when I can see a dynamic play out because then
  I can say, okay, I just saw this is what I saw. And it might be like, did you notice
  that your partner shut down when you said this? And so it&#8217;s noticing bringing
  attention to things that they can&#8217;t be aware of in the moment because they&#8217;re
  in the pattern.</p>\n<p>(<u>14:38</u>):</p>\n<p>And I like the disrupting, say,
  if you&#8217;re relating to your partner and they are in their trauma self or wounded
  self, there&#8217;s no conversation to be had in that moment. So I know I&#8217;m
  actually thinking of a specific couple I worked with where that was really useful.
  I like to tell people I&#8217;m working with that as humans, we tend to get lost
  in the content of, okay, you said this and so then I said this and then you said
  this, and it&#8217;s like, we don&#8217;t need to do that. What are you feeling?
  What did it feel like when the other person said the thing getting into the hurt
  that&#8217;s happening or the story behind it? Because what&#8217;s said is kind
  of irrelevant At the end of the day when the reactions are happening, our next response
  comes from the reaction that we&#8217;re experiencing from hearing the thing.</p>\n<p>Kara
  Bazzi (<u>15:44</u>):</p>\n<p>So yeah, seeing a pattern, and in this case that you&#8217;re
  describing, helping illuminate something that&#8217;s deeper, that&#8217;s getting
  missed by what is the emotion underneath so that there can be maybe more understanding,
  more connection, more vulnerability,</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>16:01</u>):</p>\n<p>Or
  even just stopping this cycle that is making each person feel like they&#8217;re
  not being heard. It&#8217;s like, okay, well they can&#8217;t hear you right now
  because they&#8217;re in their trauma response. So being able to recognize that
  and say, this isn&#8217;t a conversation we can have right now, let&#8217;s try
  again later when we&#8217;re both more present because I think the not feeling heard,
  not feeling seen, these are big themes that come up as well because again, I feel
  like people are like, but I do hear you. You&#8217;re saying this and it&#8217;s
  like, I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re getting to the core of what it is you&#8217;re
  feeling. And that is also take self-awareness with the client or whoever is trying
  to express their need is they need to know what is happening. And often sometimes
  they don&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>16:57</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah, I&#8217;ve experienced
  this a lot in family work where, and I just think this is a normal human pattern.
  When two people care deeply about something and they&#8217;re just clamoring to
  be heard and they&#8217;re talking over each other and they&#8217;re focused on
  what they want, what they need, and the other person&#8217;s focused on what they
  want and they need, both people are missing each other. And so those are very powerful
  moments in family sessions where a provider can again, slow them down, give each
  person space and the skills for the listener to really hear the other person and
  know that they&#8217;re going to have their turn. I think that is often what we
  just all want to be paid attention to and understood. So I think that I can think
  of many moments in sessions, that&#8217;s what I might be doing with relationships
  in the room.</p>\n<p>(<u>17:55</u>):</p>\n<p>I also wanted to add to the thing you
  said about being kind of in trauma response. I think also when we&#8217;re in just
  heightened emotion, so if we&#8217;re in an arousal zone, we think about if somebody
  is in the red with their anger or if they&#8217;re kind of just in such an arousal
  zone that they can&#8217;t listen again, we can reflect that back of what&#8217;s
  happening and pause that moment and not keep the conversation going. And oftentimes
  that&#8217;s when people say more hurtful things that they don&#8217;t even mean
  and create more distress in the dynamic than is needed because they&#8217;re in
  this state, this just in this physiological state that they&#8217;re not going to
  be effective communicators. So we can kind of point that out and help them slow
  that down and then actually feel that in a room so that they can take that away
  in the week ahead where they&#8217;re at home or in a different space to practice
  something different.</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>18:54</u>):</p>\n<p>I like the slowing
  down and curiosity. I read a lot of nonverbal cues too, and that happens in the
  group, larger group setting to leading groups. But I can think of some families
  with young adults and parents I&#8217;ve worked with where I notice one parent is
  talking and the young adult is over there making faces. And so I&#8217;m kind of
  like, oh, hey, I&#8217;m noticing a thing. What is that? What&#8217;s going on?
  And that&#8217;s something that they&#8217;re not asked because, and I&#8217;m going
  to say I&#8217;m not great at that myself with my own kid, but it&#8217;s different
  when you&#8217;re facilitating other people, but giving space and noticing and allowing
  them to then explain, well, you&#8217;re falling into lecture mode or that something&#8217;s
  missing.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>19:54</u>):</p>\n<p>And that reminds me of what
  you said earlier about being an observer. You&#8217;re able, because we&#8217;re
  removed from the emotional place of that relational system, we can see there is
  just a little bit easier to see what is playing out in a room. Sometimes we get
  involved in the dynamic and we get emotionally kind of pulled. So that&#8217;s another
  interesting piece about being in this role as therapist. So</p>\n<p>(<u>20:24</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah,
  another pattern or another way I see us as in our role as family and relationship
  therapists is that of interpreter. So again, that observational step and then helping
  navigate different temperaments in the room, different human beings, and maybe sometimes
  things get lost in translation and we might be able to have, again, a little bit
  more of a removed perspective to help maybe interpret on behalf of different types
  of people, different temperaments, et cetera. I don&#8217;t know if you have anything
  you&#8217;d want to say around that, but I feel like that is another place of something
  we&#8217;re offering in the family and relationship space.</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>21:11</u>):</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re
  not in it, we&#8217;re not in the dynamic. So I just find why wouldn&#8217;t you
  want someone else? I&#8217;m the family and relationship therapist, but why wouldn&#8217;t
  you want someone else to say to be on the outside? It can be validating for some,
  and sometimes people do feel called out and that does come up. And I would say that
  it&#8217;s not typically just one person being called out all the time, but different
  people can be in the system can be called out, and that&#8217;s okay,</p>\n<p>Kara
  Bazzi (<u>21:45</u>):</p>\n<p>But let&#8217;s go to that because I think that there
  is particular energy around the parent child dynamic. And I think partially because
  of what you&#8217;re saying is generally, I think especially when your kid is suffering
  with an eating disorder, often a parent is going to be concerned about being blamed
  for it, and they could feel a lot of guilt either, a lot of guilt and feel really
  kind of tender about it or very defended and not want to feel responsibility, but
  there can be a lot of energy around this whole blame blame thing. So I&#8217;d love
  for you to be able to speak about your experience with that around that particular
  dynamic. How do you navigate it in a session when you notice that a parent is really
  sensitive around the blame of whose responsibility is it?</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>22:46</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah,
  I think that what I&#8217;m trying to do, and I will communicate this with people
  when I feel like maybe when I sense that there is some of that happening is we&#8217;re
  not here to blame, but what we want to do is bring these patterns out into the open.
  And when we think of from a Bowen framework, it&#8217;s about shedd light shining
  a light on the patterns and how we are perpetuating and contributing to them. So
  not placing blame necessarily, but often some of these patterns are generational
  and the parent is learning from their parent or their systems and so on. So I have
  had that feeling in where, okay, I&#8217;m getting a sense that the parent is feeling
  like there&#8217;s a lot of blame being put on them. And I try to kind of back it
  up a little bit and explain this is the intention behind that, and I understand
  it feels uncomfortable and there is a part you&#8217;re playing, but we are not
  going to solely blame one person or two people, our caretakers. And most of the
  time that helps kind of smooth things and let them get there. And there have been
  times it hasn&#8217;t where they just haven&#8217;t been able to go there and it&#8217;s
  like, okay, they&#8217;re not ready to do that right now and we can&#8217;t force
  them into it. So then it&#8217;s kind of about turning to the client, what do you
  need to feel supported and safe in this relationship knowing that your loved one
  can&#8217;t do this right now? And trying to approach that with non-judgment</p>\n<p>(<u>24:54</u>):</p>\n<p>Too.</p>\n<p>Kara
  Bazzi (<u>24:54</u>):</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re bringing this in and just
  FYI for context, Bowen is a family therapy modality. You could look it up if you&#8217;re
  interested, but this idea of us finding some momentarily dead ends, I know from
  the way I approach it, sometimes we kind of find a limit and I don&#8217;t ever
  want to say to anyone that this is a limit that will last a lifetime, but for now,
  we&#8217;re hitting a limit potentially of where someone&#8217;s willing to go in
  the family work. And like you said, with non-judgment of this is, it just is what
  it is, and now how do we want to approach this? And that happens all the time where
  we might kind of bump up against somebody&#8217;s limit.</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>25:42</u>):</p>\n<p>And
  one thing I do like to talk to support people and clients about is, Hey, you&#8217;re
  in a higher level of care program right now and you&#8217;re here every day getting
  this all day, and your support person is maybe once a week, maybe twice a week if
  they&#8217;re also going to the group and doing sessions and possibly more if they&#8217;re
  really motivated to do their own self-learning. But the rate of learning and adjustment
  is not going to be equal. So just reminding people they&#8217;re trying to do it
  and it&#8217;s going to be a slower process than what you are experiencing here
  in this program, and it just has to be</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>26:30</u>):</p>\n<p>That
  way. And yeah, I&#8217;m again glad you&#8217;re saying that. I think that when
  we explicitly say that to the loved ones and the clients together, I just think
  there&#8217;s something really relieving and leveling about it because it is true
  and it&#8217;s just naming what&#8217;s true. And I think that&#8217;s really important
  just from an expectation standpoint that we&#8217;re working with something lopsided
  and that I just, again, I think that&#8217;s very kind to be explicit about to the
  system because often our clients want the loved one to just be right up there with
  them and doing the work at the same rate and the same intensity and it&#8217;s just
  not going to happen.</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>27:14</u>):</p>\n<p>No. And also that
  sometimes the clients are having a hard time with buy-in around how we&#8217;re
  reframing food and bodies and all of that, and that takes time even when they&#8217;re
  in 10 hour programming. And so kind of think about, well, if they&#8217;re only
  getting this once a week in this group and they&#8217;ve had decades of this messaging
  and this conditioning, then it&#8217;s going to be a little bit more of a process
  for them to, and they might never really get to that.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>27:49</u>):</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s
  kind of maybe jump to that around the ways we&#8217;re opening up systems for change,
  the ways we&#8217;re opening up for healing. We&#8217;ve talked about changing of
  communication patterns. We see lots of growth. Let&#8217;s talk more about the side
  of acceptance. So the witnessing that we might have or the work that we might be
  doing with our clients around being a piece of witnessing what is happening in the
  system, and again, not maybe acceptance for a lifetime, but acceptance for the moment
  of this limit. And how we also see that as part of the healing work makes me think
  of, I mean, I&#8217;ll just say briefly myself, the clients that come and just putting
  their hand on the stove and keep trying over and over to change something within
  somebody that they love and they just keep, they&#8217;re not recognizing the limit
  and how that&#8217;s not serving them and that&#8217;s actually maybe harming them
  in their recovery. Do you have it an example of that or do you want to add to what
  I&#8217;m saying? Or do you have an example of work you&#8217;ve done where you&#8217;ve,
  it&#8217;s been more about witnessing and helping the client kind of come to some
  acceptance about what they can&#8217;t get?</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>29:08</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah,
  I mean multiple, yeah, examples come to mind and the specific examples I&#8217;m
  thinking of are younger clients, younger adult clients because it&#8217;s been more
  of a parental acceptance around, I didn&#8217;t have the mom I wanted, I didn&#8217;t
  have the dad I wanted and I really just want them to be this way. And maybe we&#8217;ve
  tried doing the work and the parent just, isn&#8217;t it the caretaker&#8217;s just
  not getting it? And sometimes there&#8217;s real desire there, they really want
  to get it, but they&#8217;re just where they&#8217;re at and they&#8217;re not always
  getting it in the way that the child or the client is hoping that they will. And
  so then sometimes we will pull back and maybe do some one-on-one work around what
  is it that you are needing? If you&#8217;re going to be a participant in this relationship
  and you want to continue in this relationship, sometimes there&#8217;s financial
  dependence as well.</p>\n<p>(<u>30:19</u>):</p>\n<p>And so there isn&#8217;t choice
  around that. And so, hey, how can we, let&#8217;s explore what it is that will feel
  like enough right now. And I like what you&#8217;re saying about this is the limit
  for now. It is not always the limit. Maybe down the road there will be a different
  opportunity. And I think opportunity is the word that comes up when I think about
  doing family relationship work is we&#8217;re not necessarily creating change, but
  we&#8217;re creating an opportunity for change to happen because the change is by
  choice. And we&#8217;re kind of opening this door and saying, here&#8217;s a chance
  for your system to evolve. And some folks walk right in and some don&#8217;t. So</p>\n<p>Kara
  Bazzi (<u>31:14</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah,</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>31:15</u>):</p>\n<p>And
  I would say on the flip side of acceptance is from the caretaker or partner or loved
  one perspective, particularly around eating disorder and treatment. And there might
  be acceptance of this might not look how I hope it looks. I do see a fair amount
  of parents that are kind of cheerleaders and they&#8217;re like, you got this and
  you&#8217;re strong and you&#8217;re smart. And just plow through it and kind of
  like, let&#8217;s talk about the reality of, or the possibility if we even just
  talk about impossibility, what if it isn&#8217;t done in eight weeks? What if it
  isn&#8217;t done in three months? What if your child has to defer school? What if
  they make that choice? So I think that&#8217;s a piece that loved ones really the
  acceptance around that can be really hard to come to.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>32:18</u>):</p>\n<p>Definitely.
  Yeah, there&#8217;s a lot that we&#8217;re getting at in this. I was thinking when
  we were talking about that acceptance piece of some on the client side where there
  there&#8217;s this fantasy, I wish my mom, I wish my dad could be kind of exactly
  this way or come alongside this new way of thinking around health at every size
  or weight inclusion and kind of live and breathe it themselves. And if they can&#8217;t,
  I can&#8217;t be in relationship with almost this kind of black and white. You&#8217;re
  either doing it fully or how could I bear to be in relationship with you? And if
  we come across a limit of a parent isn&#8217;t ready to change the way that they
  view food and body, I think as an FRTI often, I want to give a lot of freedom to
  the loved one. They get to make their own choices. But from a client&#8217;s perspective,
  I think some of the work we might be doing is grief, grief work to, even if we can&#8217;t
  grieve that, then it&#8217;s hard to get to a place of acceptance. And when we get
  to acceptance, we can live in more of the gray of, I can still now actually appreciate
  some of the lovely pieces of my parent and not just be angry all the time that they&#8217;re
  not exactly this vision of perfection that they might want. So</p>\n<p>(<u>33:52</u>):</p>\n<p>That
  can be really meaningful work</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>33:56</u>):</p>\n<p>Accessing
  the grief. Also grief in the example I was using from the parent side of realizing
  that your child may not be living the life that you had hoped for or envisioned
  for them and getting to the grief in that too. And even with the client, they&#8217;re
  probably not living the life they had envisioned for themselves either many times.
  So getting to the grief, I think, yeah, grief is a huge part of this work. Totally,</p>\n<p>Kara
  Bazzi (<u>34:28</u>):</p>\n<p>Yes. Okay. Well, let&#8217;s change gears a bit and
  talk a little bit about, I mentioned earlier our recent shift towards working with
  more adolescents and starting to work with adolescents age 16 and older. And we&#8217;ve
  worked with Opal anywhere from age now We have a 17. We we&#8217;ve had 70th through
  17 all the way up to 74. So I&#8217;d love to talk about how relationship therapy
  might change what that could look like through these different developmental stages
  because obviously an adolescent, their brain is developed, they&#8217;re not fully
  formed adults, and then all the way up to 74 and thinking about end life back more
  in an end of life type of approaching that stage. Yeah. Is there anything you&#8217;d
  want to share about patterns or thematic things that might look a little different
  from an age perspective?</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>35:30</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah, I mean,
  I love working with all systems, but I feel like I have special place for families
  of young adults, particularly those who are preparing for launch or mid-launch.
  It is a really challenging time of parenthood and still requires a lot of attunement,
  but in a way that is a lot more confusing than when they&#8217;re 12 or in pre-adolescence.
  I had say for the 16, 17 year olds, they&#8217;re still living at home. There&#8217;s
  still an authority relationship with caretakers that is hopefully lessening as they
  get to 18, 19, 20. And of course it&#8217;s developmentally appropriate for people
  this age to be looking more outside of the family system for validation, connection,
  all that kind of stuff. So it&#8217;s like how do we do that dance? And also there&#8217;s
  this idea that when our kids turn 18, it means something like they&#8217;re fine
  now. They&#8217;re adults, they&#8217;re going to college. Maybe they&#8217;re not
  adults. They&#8217;re not adults yet.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>37:04</u>):</p>\n<p>I
  have an 18-year-old right now who is graduating in a month. I&#8217;m right on it.</p>\n<p>Nikki
  Wolf (<u>37:10</u>):</p>\n<p>I have a 21-year-old, and she&#8217;s of course different
  than an 18. And there&#8217;s still a lot of management happening. And so I love
  to work with parents and caretakers that are in that phase to kind of be like, well,
  there&#8217;s grief here because you&#8217;re soon to be an empty nester or your
  kids are growing up, they don&#8217;t need you in the same way. And just noting,
  this is when I went back to grad school because this is when I switched careers,
  so let&#8217;s acknowledge that, but your child is wanting independence and freedom.
  And so we want to also honor that. I think kids, sorry, the young adults sometimes
  are kind of like, I just want &#8217;em to leave me stop texting, so stop. And I&#8217;m
  like, Hey, they&#8217;re not going to stop caring just because you&#8217;re turning
  18. They have needs too. So working in that system to find the balance, and maybe
  it changes week to week, but having that line of communication open in a way that
  works for both people and there&#8217;s an eating disorder involved and there&#8217;s
  an eating disorder.</p>\n<p>(<u>38:36</u>):</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m even mentioning the
  eating disorder. So then there&#8217;s that. Yeah, and I think that with the younger
  clients having the eating disorder component too, there is kind of more of the parental
  control, parental authority, but we&#8217;re still walking that line of they are
  going to be launching soon if that&#8217;s their vision, if that&#8217;s what everybody&#8217;s
  hoping for. And so how are we going to do that? And it&#8217;s challenging and I
  really like doing that, and I don&#8217;t think that there is a lot of focus on
  that piece of it is of both things are true and valid. And I&#8217;ve heard from
  some caretakers that there is talking about acceptance and grief of realizing there&#8217;s
  a point where they just have to let go of any control or expectation and realize
  that your kid&#8217;s going to live your life and hopefully they&#8217;re just doing
  the best they can and you don&#8217;t want them suffering and struggling. And if
  they are, there&#8217;s only so much you can do to change that for them. So that&#8217;s
  the younger folks,</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>39:53</u>):</p>\n<p>And maybe I&#8217;d
  add in that or ask a question for parents that are going through that launching
  phase or the young adult side and then their kid has an eating disorder. I think
  the intuition would be like, now I am getting more involved again because they are
  sick, they are ill, they need help. I&#8217;m their parent. I care, of course, I
  care deeply about my child who is suffering, and yet they&#8217;re still in that
  stage. And I think that is just this weird, so it&#8217;s already so layered if
  somebody isn&#8217;t is well and launching because obviously they still need things.
  My daughter still needs things. They&#8217;re not fully independent. But then there&#8217;s
  this urge to parent more obviously when an eating disorder is there. So I guess
  would you, you be encouraging the parents in a system like that, they don&#8217;t
  have to double down on the</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>40:58</u>):</p>\n<p>Caretaking?
  Yeah, I mean I actually see this not even with just the minor clients, but clients
  who are young adult and have been in adolescent treatment where there&#8217;s a
  heavy focus on parent involvement and support, and parents are essentially controlling.
  They&#8217;re in charge of the food and all the care at home, and then they turn
  18 and they come to adult treatment and we&#8217;re like, guess what? We don&#8217;t
  have to tell you stuff anymore. And that is really, really, really hard. So sorry,
  I forgot your question. I don&#8217;t know where I was going.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi
  (<u>41:40</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah, I was just curious if you would basically say you
  don&#8217;t double. There is still part of letting go and working through a launch
  and it seems so confusing for a parent of how do I navigate that? Am I just letting
  my child flounder as they&#8217;re off in college? Do they just need to be home
  and nurtured by me 24 7?</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>42:10</u>):</p>\n<p>I think it&#8217;s
  sort of like there&#8217;s still maybe a doubling down for a period of time, and
  then the work is gradually handing it back to the client and then we are here to
  help you if you need help. If they get to the point where they go through treatment
  and they&#8217;re feeling well enough to go off to college and then they go to college
  and they tank, it&#8217;s being available being we&#8217;re here to help you. We
  will be there. We&#8217;re going to check in. Maybe that&#8217;s the agreement that
  we&#8217;re trying to come to is how much of your parents&#8217; attention is feeling
  like enough or too much? And from the caretaker&#8217;s end, how much and response
  do you need from your loved one, from your kid to know that they&#8217;re okay?
  And so coming to that agreement, and I think that many parents do want that launch
  to happen and obviously for their child to be well to do it, and maybe talking about
  what does well look like to you and what if they&#8217;re recovered enough in the
  moment or maybe they could use more treatment, but they&#8217;re choosing to not
  defer school or go to school.</p>\n<p>(<u>43:36</u>):</p>\n<p>So how are we going
  to address that? So yeah, right now there are, because we get so many 18 to 25-year-old
  clients, there are many cycling through my head right now, including younger and
  things that we&#8217;ve focused on with them. And I would say that more often than
  not, the caretaker&#8217;s desire is for their child to be launching and trying
  to get to a place where they feel stable enough that that can happen safely.</p>\n<p>Kara
  Bazzi (<u>44:17</u>):</p>\n<p>And like you said, that negotiation, there isn&#8217;t
  one way of doing that negotiation.</p>\n<p>(<u>44:21</u>):</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s going
  to look so different for any kid and parent system. There isn&#8217;t one. How much
  support is the family system giving so varying depending on the unique individuals
  at play. And I would also say a thing that comes up frequently is the support that
  a parent gives or support a loved one gives isn&#8217;t static. It&#8217;s going
  to change what the loved one needs can change. So week to week, day to day, we always
  get the what can I do to support, what can I do to help? There isn&#8217;t just
  this program you do for the next two years, it&#8217;s ever evolving. It does require
  a lot of communication. It does require the person struggling with the eating disorder
  to communicate that to the loved one. You don&#8217;t have to guess. It&#8217;s
  not about reading somebody&#8217;s mind. It really does. That&#8217;s what we as
  providers are helping our clients do is how to share, connect with what they need
  and share it with the people in their life so that the loved ones don&#8217;t have
  to do all the guesswork</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>45:29</u>):</p>\n<p>Because</p>\n<p>Kara
  Bazzi (<u>45:29</u>):</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not helpful.</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>45:30</u>):</p>\n<p>I
  think that actually is a theme that comes up a lot, particularly with in marriages
  and partnerships, like romantic partnerships of how will I know when my partner
  is struggling, what cues should I be looking about for? And I am like, we&#8217;re
  not mind readers because one person&#8217;s cues are not another person&#8217;s
  cues. So I can&#8217;t help you read their mind better. Sorry. So then we do talk
  about that direct communication, practicing direct communication. And it&#8217;s
  very nuanced too. Some people think of it more as monitoring certain questions.
  How do you ask questions? What questions to ask? Because hey, don&#8217;t monitor
  me. Don&#8217;t ask me questions about my food. Don&#8217;t ask me questions about
  this. How much am I eating? And there are other people who are like, yeah, will
  you ask me questions about my food? And so there isn&#8217;t just that one</p>\n<p>Kara
  Bazzi (<u>46:42</u>):</p>\n<p>Size does not fit all.</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>46:43</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah.
  So that&#8217;s a thing we talk about a lot in the support group is because they&#8217;re
  like, how do I know? What are the red flags? And we have to say, well, I don&#8217;t
  know what your person&#8217;s red flags are. They know and hopefully are talking
  about that before they discharge. And maybe you could ask them why didn&#8217;t
  you ask them directly? And they may share and they may not.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>47:12</u>):</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s
  so true. Other, I know we&#8217;ve been talking about more that launching stage.
  Was there anything you did want to say about other life stages?</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf
  (<u>47:21</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah, I think my approach later in life, some people still
  do work with caretakers, parents and family of origin, but I&#8217;m thinking of
  some couples that I&#8217;ve worked with where we are talking still, we&#8217;re
  talking a lot about family of origin stuff. What have we learned about relationships
  from our families that we grew up in and how are we bringing that into this dynamic
  here? And I know that trauma has played a big role in that as well, trauma experiences.
  So how is that adding to dynamics that are coming up and patterns that are coming
  up? You mentioned we&#8217;ve had clients up to age 74 and I have worked with older
  couples and the generational influences are very real around diet, body food. So
  we may not be completely dismantling that stuff, but bringing in new ideas and new
  ways of interacting, communicating always comes back to that communication.</p>\n<p>Kara
  Bazzi (<u>48:36</u>):</p>\n<p>I mean, we could be talking about this all day. It&#8217;s
  very fun. We like talking about family therapy. Yeah, I love it. And I&#8217;m wondering
  if there&#8217;s anything just for now that you&#8217;d like to share that&#8217;s
  been missing from this conversation. Is there anything you&#8217;d want to make
  sure is kind of in the context of this episode?</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>48:56</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah,
  I think maybe I mentioned earlier about the system, and by system I mean whatever
  family unit or relationship unit probably should have said that earlier that you&#8217;re
  working with. But the unit being the client and a good family relationship therapist
  will not collude with either individual within that unit. And I think that&#8217;s
  really important. And it&#8217;s something I try to be really clear about when I
  start working with people, especially when there are parents involved, because they
  might want to email me and get information. And so I say, if you have questions,
  you can email me. Or if you have things you want to bring in, you&#8217;re not really
  sure how you want to bring them into session, you can let me know. But if you email
  me about other stuff, I&#8217;m going to respond and CC your loved one for transparency
  and say, this would be a great topic to discuss in our next session.</p>\n<p>(<u>49:57</u>):</p>\n<p>And
  because we&#8217;re in a unique situation with the higher level of care, we&#8217;re
  not outpatient providers. And if I were an outpatient provider, I would only be
  seeing the family once a week. I wouldn&#8217;t know about other aspects of their
  care. But because we&#8217;re a kind of a more closed system and we&#8217;re consulting
  all the time on a treatment team level, I do know more, but I let the family know
  that I&#8217;m not meeting with this person. They have their own individual therapist.
  They&#8217;re having sessions with their other providers as well. And so I am meeting
  with this client while I&#8217;m meeting with you. So I think that&#8217;s important
  for people to understand too, is how the attitude of the therapist coming in and
  how they&#8217;re holding the individuals within. Right,</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>50:53</u>):</p>\n<p>Right.
  And I&#8217;m glad you said that because it does highlight that we did make that
  decision from the get-go with Opal to have a separate primary therapist and separated
  from the family and relationship therapist for that exact point that the family
  and relationship therapist is for everybody in the room. And we can&#8217;t have
  zero bias going in, and we will know a little bit more about the client, but it&#8217;s
  really important value of ours to be doing true family therapy, which would be that
  we are there for each person in the room. And so that&#8217;s why we set it up structurally
  to have a different therapist. And that may make us, I know maybe other treatment
  centers do that as well, but sometimes the treatment centers have the primary therapist
  be the family therapist, but that was, we chose not to go that direction for that
  exact reason. Yeah.</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>51:47</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah. I mean, for
  me personally, that would be a really rough line because sometimes even now I get
  information from the team and I&#8217;m kind of like, I can&#8217;t just bring that
  in. That needs to be brought in by the families. So it can be tricky, but I don&#8217;t
  personally feel like it&#8217;s hard for me. It&#8217;s just an interesting addition
  to what we&#8217;re doing. Totally.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>52:22</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah.
  Okay. Nikki, if our listeners are interested to learn more about family systems
  work from this awesome conversation with eating disorders, do you have any resources
  to point them to? Anything you want to say out loud that we can link in the show
  notes?</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>52:37</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah. The Opal website, Opal Food
  and body.com has an FRT page family relationship therapy page. And there are a lot
  of resources for books, podcasts. It&#8217;s an evolving list, so things will continue
  to be added. And I am going to begin to offer an outpatient family and relationship
  therapy support group, just, which is, I&#8217;m calling it FRT Support Group 2.0,
  which is very similar to the one we offer in program, but it will be for outpatient.
  And that is a combination of learning, education and process. So just sharing experiences
  about what it&#8217;s like to be a support person of somebody going through this
  journey with some learning involved too. So that can be accessed by contacting me
  directly, nikki@wolfheartcounseling.net is my email address for people who are interested
  in, I do have a website under construction right now, and we&#8217;ll be up soon
  and then Feast the online forum geared more towards caretakers of adolescents as

  (<u>00:07</u>):</p>\n<p>Hello and welcome to the Appetite, a podcast brought to
  you by Opal Food and Body Wisdom, an eating disorder treatment clinic in Seattle,
  Washington. It is a podcast about all things food, body movement, and mental health.
  I’m Kara Bazzi, a co-founder and clinical director for Opal, a licensed marriage
  and family therapist, as well as your host for today. So welcome to today’s episode.
  I’m excited to be joined by Nikki Wolf, one of the incredible therapists at Opal
  and Nikki specializes in family and relationship therapy, working closely with clients
  to explore how relationships can both contribute to the life force of an eating
  disorder and serve as a powerful resource for healing. She also leads groups at
  Opal focused on these dynamics, helping individuals navigate the complexities of
  connection with others and recovery as someone who shares a deep passion for family
  and relationship therapy. I’m really looking forward to this conversation, so let’s
  dive in. Welcome Nikki.</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>01:07</u>):</p>\n<p>Thank you. I’m
  excited to be here.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>01:10</u>):</p>\n<p>I’m excited to have
  you. So I would love to start just by giving listeners a little bit of background
  information on you, how you came to be interested in doing the work of eating disorders,
  and in particular the family and relationship work. This is a part of the work that
  a lot of people are intimidated by of doing the family system work, so I’d love
  to hear how you got here.</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>01:36</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah, so eating
  disorders, I have a young adult child daughter, and when she was in high school
  and an adolescent, I became very aware of the prevalence of disordered eating among
  her peers. It wasn’t necessarily at that time I felt like I need to go work in this
  field. This is my second career as you know, I was working as an acupuncturist before
  it was when I was in grad school. I found Opal and your approach, Opal’s approach,
  at least from the R-O-D-B-T perspective was new to me and it was really exciting
  and inspiring and I knew I wanted to be a part of it. So it was kind of a slow burn.
  The family systems piece that’s very personal to me. I’ve done a lot of work personally
  around my family of origin, working with my husband and his family of origin, and
  it’s been a really powerful journey to healing my current relationships, how I show
  up in my relationships now, understanding that systems piece from my childhood and
  my own relationship with my family. So there’s been a lot of healing for me in that
  and I just really want to be a part of that for others and give others that opportunity
  to change how they’re showing up in their relationships.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>03:07</u>):</p>\n<p>Cool.
  Yeah, I think of how I know who our listeners are, even if we haven’t had our own
  personal experience with an eating disorder or disordered eating, most of us have
  been in relationship with somebody who struggled in this way. So I would love for
  you to talk a little bit more about your experience in working with loved ones with
  parents, spouses, partners, roommates, friends, what have you typically experienced
  as the loved ones? Posture towards the person struggling with an eating disorder.
  And I guess I would also want to say to give some context, we do family and relationship
  therapy at Opal and we have historically served clients that are 18 and older now
  we are taking clients from 16 years and older, but we have worked with most of our
  clients who are no longer living with their family of families of origin or at home,
  but we have had that be an integral part of our treatment and most of our clients
  have participated in this family relationship work. So I think that’s something
  unique to Opal that we’ve done adult treatment and then had this regular consistency
  with family therapy. And so I would love to just have you share what do you typically,
  what do you see when you’re in the room with these loved ones?</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf
  (<u>04:30</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah, there’s a huge educational component a lot of times,
  particularly with support people who are new to the eating disorder and recovery
  journey. A lot of what can I do to fix this? I would say if I had to pick a number
  one theme, the question how do I best support my loved one usually means how do
  I problem solve or fix this? And the education comes in with the Tuesday night group
  or in individual sessions, it’s more about that direct communication and maybe talking
  about the eating disorder directly or what the needs are within the system, how
  the family is working together, whether it’s teenager or adult with a partner coming
  in or roommates. We see all kinds of dynamics in Opal and that’s the one I think
  that we probably talk the most about, at least in the beginning. And there’s a lot
  of trepidation to go into uncovering patterns and talking about really uncomfortable
  stuff that might come up in the family session or the relationship therapy session.
  And so there is some building rapport, doing some education around eating disorders.
  What does family systems therapy look like? What does relationship therapy look
  like? It could look different ways. And then I would also say bumping up against
  support people’s own biases about what is an eating disorder, how to address it,
  and their own relationship with food and bodies and potentially disordered eating.
  That does show up a lot. Role of communication. That is a huge one too.</p>\n<p>Kara
  Bazzi (<u>06:22</u>):</p>\n<p>So you’re saying that maybe the posture of trepidation
  some concern, but the posture of what can I do to fix this quote problem that a
  lot of support people come in with. And what, I guess just to make sure the listeners
  are understanding what, can you say more about that dynamic of how we might address
  that posture of this fixing? Is that what we’re doing? Are we telling the support
  people what they can do to fix this eating disorder or how might we be addressing
  that very common way of showing up to treatment to start with?</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf
  (<u>07:03</u>):</p>\n<p>That’s a great question. Typically, no, we’re not encouraging
  fixing it might. So I’m thinking about a family that I worked with and it was parents
  and a young adult. And I would say that this is a very common pattern to see with
  parents who are supporting people in our program because as a parent, it’s really
  hard, and I mean as a person in relationship, it’s hard to see our loved one struggling
  and in pain. And as a parent it can have its own set of challenges. And so it’s
  kind of maybe uncovering what if you can’t fix it, what’s the emotion driving that?
  There’s a lot of helplessness that comes in, a lot of acceptance around, well, this
  journey might look a lot different than I had hoped. And so my intent is to dig
  in to authentic communication around that and emotional expression, like open expression
  of emotion. We don’t always get there in the time that we have and that’s okay,
  but maybe introducing a new way of thinking about supporting your loved one might
  not be about problem solving or fixing or tell me about your day. I want to know
  everything. It might be, God, that sounds really hard. That’s bringing up a lot
  for me. What do I need to do to care for my own process in this?</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi
  (<u>08:51</u>):</p>\n<p>Which when I hear you say that, I hear maybe for example,
  instead of fixing, you might be helping loved ones learn how to validate what’s
  happening for the other person and maybe working on caring for their own needs of
  what’s coming up in relationship with the person, for example. So that could be
  a different way of helping and supporting the healing of a system versus what can
  they do or say to fix the eating disorder.</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>09:18</u>):</p>\n<p>Absolutely.
  I think the parallel process of learning that support people are doing is really
  important. And I think it’s also very meaningful to the clients who are in treatment
  and doing that own learning and examining of self and potentially getting their
  own help through therapy or support groups. That’s a lot of the feedback we do get
  in the Tuesday family relationship therapy support group is just how valuable it
  is for the support people to learn these new ways of being in relationship and practice
  it and potentially get closer to their loved one.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>10:01</u>):</p>\n<p>It
  makes me think of what so often happens in family therapy or family and relationship
  therapy is the loved ones might come in with a certain idea or expectation of what
  the work could look like and it’s not matching what that is. And some systems might
  feel resistant to that difference or welcome it be open, flexible. But I just think
  of, yeah, it’s often not where people might think the starting point is that it
  goes in a different direction of what the actual work of healing could be within
  that system.</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>10:37</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah, I mean the thinking
  sometimes they’ll come into the session and it’s a very heady, let’s logistically
  talk about this very rational, but your loved one has a need, has an emotional need
  that’s not being met. And so how can we start to communicate about that? So it’s
  also not just about the client that’s in our program. I try to be pretty clear when
  I start working with couples and different relationships, families, that the family
  is my client. We’re not, even though our client is in programming with us, if in
  the family relationship therapy setting, the family is the client and we’re there
  to talk about and to discover dynamics in that system, not just what the client
  is bringing with their eating disorder.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>11:39</u>):</p>\n<p>And
  maybe we could talk a little bit about, I know you touched on this, but what are
  other things that we might be addressing in those systems and those sessions? Because
  what we’re kind of addressing in those patterns in the system, and I know when I’ve
  been in that role, a family and relationship therapist, I am looking for patterns
  that these relationships have been stuck in and looking for ways to disrupt and
  to experiment and try things new and often it lands in the realm of communication,
  expression of feelings and what others, what other things? I think of what we just
  said earlier, the validation, learning, teaching people the skills of listening,
  again, not fixing. So that might be, we sometimes bring in this skill we call the
  move skill, which is about learning how to slow down, listen, validate and empathize,
  and really give people full turn to be able to do that in the moment of a heated
  conflict and then take turns doing it and really slowing someone down to try something
  different. And oftentimes the family therapist can be so useful because we can disrupt
  these patterns and give a timeout and try something different. So what else would
  you say in that vein? Are things that you’re doing in the room that would be common,
  things you’re disrupting or introducing that these relationships hadn’t experienced
  yet?</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>13:14</u>):</p>\n<p>I mean, everything you just said
  about disrupting, I’m like, yes, I do that. That’s my primary goal. And that I would
  say when there’s a lot of trauma in either with one person in the room or both people
  in the room, there’s something that happens when conflict starts or disagreement
  or an argument that tends to happen over and over again where I’ve seen clients
  kind of revert back to their wounded self or the trauma self. And so we might be,
  I would say observation is my main job. I’m observing what’s happening. I actually
  really like it when I can see a dynamic play out because then I can say, okay, I
  just saw this is what I saw. And it might be like, did you notice that your partner
  shut down when you said this? And so it’s noticing bringing attention to things
  that they can’t be aware of in the moment because they’re in the pattern.</p>\n<p>(<u>14:38</u>):</p>\n<p>And
  I like the disrupting, say, if you’re relating to your partner and they are in their
  trauma self or wounded self, there’s no conversation to be had in that moment. So
  I know I’m actually thinking of a specific couple I worked with where that was really
  useful. I like to tell people I’m working with that as humans, we tend to get lost
  in the content of, okay, you said this and so then I said this and then you said
  this, and it’s like, we don’t need to do that. What are you feeling? What did it
  feel like when the other person said the thing getting into the hurt that’s happening
  or the story behind it? Because what’s said is kind of irrelevant At the end of
  the day when the reactions are happening, our next response comes from the reaction
  that we’re experiencing from hearing the thing.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>15:44</u>):</p>\n<p>So
  yeah, seeing a pattern, and in this case that you’re describing, helping illuminate
  something that’s deeper, that’s getting missed by what is the emotion underneath
  so that there can be maybe more understanding, more connection, more vulnerability,</p>\n<p>Nikki
  Wolf (<u>16:01</u>):</p>\n<p>Or even just stopping this cycle that is making each
  person feel like they’re not being heard. It’s like, okay, well they can’t hear
  you right now because they’re in their trauma response. So being able to recognize
  that and say, this isn’t a conversation we can have right now, let’s try again later
  when we’re both more present because I think the not feeling heard, not feeling
  seen, these are big themes that come up as well because again, I feel like people
  are like, but I do hear you. You’re saying this and it’s like, I don’t think you’re
  getting to the core of what it is you’re feeling. And that is also take self-awareness
  with the client or whoever is trying to express their need is they need to know
  what is happening. And often sometimes they don’t.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>16:57</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah,
  I’ve experienced this a lot in family work where, and I just think this is a normal
  human pattern. When two people care deeply about something and they’re just clamoring
  to be heard and they’re talking over each other and they’re focused on what they
  want, what they need, and the other person’s focused on what they want and they
  need, both people are missing each other. And so those are very powerful moments
  in family sessions where a provider can again, slow them down, give each person
  space and the skills for the listener to really hear the other person and know that
  they’re going to have their turn. I think that is often what we just all want to
  be paid attention to and understood. So I think that I can think of many moments
  in sessions, that’s what I might be doing with relationships in the room.</p>\n<p>(<u>17:55</u>):</p>\n<p>I
  also wanted to add to the thing you said about being kind of in trauma response.
  I think also when we’re in just heightened emotion, so if we’re in an arousal zone,
  we think about if somebody is in the red with their anger or if they’re kind of
  just in such an arousal zone that they can’t listen again, we can reflect that back
  of what’s happening and pause that moment and not keep the conversation going. And
  oftentimes that’s when people say more hurtful things that they don’t even mean
  and create more distress in the dynamic than is needed because they’re in this state,
  this just in this physiological state that they’re not going to be effective communicators.
  So we can kind of point that out and help them slow that down and then actually
  feel that in a room so that they can take that away in the week ahead where they’re
  at home or in a different space to practice something different.</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf
  (<u>18:54</u>):</p>\n<p>I like the slowing down and curiosity. I read a lot of nonverbal
  cues too, and that happens in the group, larger group setting to leading groups.
  But I can think of some families with young adults and parents I’ve worked with
  where I notice one parent is talking and the young adult is over there making faces.
  And so I’m kind of like, oh, hey, I’m noticing a thing. What is that? What’s going
  on? And that’s something that they’re not asked because, and I’m going to say I’m
  not great at that myself with my own kid, but it’s different when you’re facilitating
  other people, but giving space and noticing and allowing them to then explain, well,
  you’re falling into lecture mode or that something’s missing.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi
  (<u>19:54</u>):</p>\n<p>And that reminds me of what you said earlier about being
  an observer. You’re able, because we’re removed from the emotional place of that
  relational system, we can see there is just a little bit easier to see what is playing
  out in a room. Sometimes we get involved in the dynamic and we get emotionally kind
  of pulled. So that’s another interesting piece about being in this role as therapist.
  So</p>\n<p>(<u>20:24</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah, another pattern or another way I see us
  as in our role as family and relationship therapists is that of interpreter. So
  again, that observational step and then helping navigate different temperaments
  in the room, different human beings, and maybe sometimes things get lost in translation
  and we might be able to have, again, a little bit more of a removed perspective
  to help maybe interpret on behalf of different types of people, different temperaments,
  et cetera. I don’t know if you have anything you’d want to say around that, but
  I feel like that is another place of something we’re offering in the family and
  relationship space.</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>21:11</u>):</p>\n<p>We’re not in it,
  we’re not in the dynamic. So I just find why wouldn’t you want someone else? I’m
  the family and relationship therapist, but why wouldn’t you want someone else to
  say to be on the outside? It can be validating for some, and sometimes people do
  feel called out and that does come up. And I would say that it’s not typically just
  one person being called out all the time, but different people can be in the system
  can be called out, and that’s okay,</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>21:45</u>):</p>\n<p>But
  let’s go to that because I think that there is particular energy around the parent
  child dynamic. And I think partially because of what you’re saying is generally,
  I think especially when your kid is suffering with an eating disorder, often a parent
  is going to be concerned about being blamed for it, and they could feel a lot of
  guilt either, a lot of guilt and feel really kind of tender about it or very defended
  and not want to feel responsibility, but there can be a lot of energy around this
  whole blame blame thing. So I’d love for you to be able to speak about your experience
  with that around that particular dynamic. How do you navigate it in a session when
  you notice that a parent is really sensitive around the blame of whose responsibility
  is it?</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>22:46</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah, I think that what I’m trying
  to do, and I will communicate this with people when I feel like maybe when I sense
  that there is some of that happening is we’re not here to blame, but what we want
  to do is bring these patterns out into the open. And when we think of from a Bowen
  framework, it’s about shedd light shining a light on the patterns and how we are
  perpetuating and contributing to them. So not placing blame necessarily, but often
  some of these patterns are generational and the parent is learning from their parent
  or their systems and so on. So I have had that feeling in where, okay, I’m getting
  a sense that the parent is feeling like there’s a lot of blame being put on them.
  And I try to kind of back it up a little bit and explain this is the intention behind
  that, and I understand it feels uncomfortable and there is a part you’re playing,
  but we are not going to solely blame one person or two people, our caretakers. And
  most of the time that helps kind of smooth things and let them get there. And there
  have been times it hasn’t where they just haven’t been able to go there and it’s
  like, okay, they’re not ready to do that right now and we can’t force them into
  it. So then it’s kind of about turning to the client, what do you need to feel supported
  and safe in this relationship knowing that your loved one can’t do this right now?
  And trying to approach that with non-judgment</p>\n<p>(<u>24:54</u>):</p>\n<p>Too.</p>\n<p>Kara
  Bazzi (<u>24:54</u>):</p>\n<p>I’m glad you’re bringing this in and just FYI for
  context, Bowen is a family therapy modality. You could look it up if you’re interested,
  but this idea of us finding some momentarily dead ends, I know from the way I approach
  it, sometimes we kind of find a limit and I don’t ever want to say to anyone that
  this is a limit that will last a lifetime, but for now, we’re hitting a limit potentially
  of where someone’s willing to go in the family work. And like you said, with non-judgment
  of this is, it just is what it is, and now how do we want to approach this? And
  that happens all the time where we might kind of bump up against somebody’s limit.</p>\n<p>Nikki
  Wolf (<u>25:42</u>):</p>\n<p>And one thing I do like to talk to support people and
  clients about is, Hey, you’re in a higher level of care program right now and you’re
  here every day getting this all day, and your support person is maybe once a week,
  maybe twice a week if they’re also going to the group and doing sessions and possibly
  more if they’re really motivated to do their own self-learning. But the rate of
  learning and adjustment is not going to be equal. So just reminding people they’re
  trying to do it and it’s going to be a slower process than what you are experiencing
  here in this program, and it just has to be</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>26:30</u>):</p>\n<p>That
  way. And yeah, I’m again glad you’re saying that. I think that when we explicitly
  say that to the loved ones and the clients together, I just think there’s something
  really relieving and leveling about it because it is true and it’s just naming what’s
  true. And I think that’s really important just from an expectation standpoint that
  we’re working with something lopsided and that I just, again, I think that’s very
  kind to be explicit about to the system because often our clients want the loved
  one to just be right up there with them and doing the work at the same rate and
  the same intensity and it’s just not going to happen.</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>27:14</u>):</p>\n<p>No.
  And also that sometimes the clients are having a hard time with buy-in around how
  we’re reframing food and bodies and all of that, and that takes time even when they’re
  in 10 hour programming. And so kind of think about, well, if they’re only getting
  this once a week in this group and they’ve had decades of this messaging and this
  conditioning, then it’s going to be a little bit more of a process for them to,
  and they might never really get to that.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>27:49</u>):</p>\n<p>Let’s
  kind of maybe jump to that around the ways we’re opening up systems for change,
  the ways we’re opening up for healing. We’ve talked about changing of communication
  patterns. We see lots of growth. Let’s talk more about the side of acceptance. So
  the witnessing that we might have or the work that we might be doing with our clients
  around being a piece of witnessing what is happening in the system, and again, not
  maybe acceptance for a lifetime, but acceptance for the moment of this limit. And
  how we also see that as part of the healing work makes me think of, I mean, I’ll
  just say briefly myself, the clients that come and just putting their hand on the
  stove and keep trying over and over to change something within somebody that they
  love and they just keep, they’re not recognizing the limit and how that’s not serving
  them and that’s actually maybe harming them in their recovery. Do you have it an
  example of that or do you want to add to what I’m saying? Or do you have an example
  of work you’ve done where you’ve, it’s been more about witnessing and helping the
  client kind of come to some acceptance about what they can’t get?</p>\n<p>Nikki
  Wolf (<u>29:08</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah, I mean multiple, yeah, examples come to mind
  and the specific examples I’m thinking of are younger clients, younger adult clients
  because it’s been more of a parental acceptance around, I didn’t have the mom I
  wanted, I didn’t have the dad I wanted and I really just want them to be this way.
  And maybe we’ve tried doing the work and the parent just, isn’t it the caretaker’s
  just not getting it? And sometimes there’s real desire there, they really want to
  get it, but they’re just where they’re at and they’re not always getting it in the
  way that the child or the client is hoping that they will. And so then sometimes
  we will pull back and maybe do some one-on-one work around what is it that you are
  needing? If you’re going to be a participant in this relationship and you want to
  continue in this relationship, sometimes there’s financial dependence as well.</p>\n<p>(<u>30:19</u>):</p>\n<p>And
  so there isn’t choice around that. And so, hey, how can we, let’s explore what it
  is that will feel like enough right now. And I like what you’re saying about this
  is the limit for now. It is not always the limit. Maybe down the road there will
  be a different opportunity. And I think opportunity is the word that comes up when
  I think about doing family relationship work is we’re not necessarily creating change,
  but we’re creating an opportunity for change to happen because the change is by
  choice. And we’re kind of opening this door and saying, here’s a chance for your
  system to evolve. And some folks walk right in and some don’t. So</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi
  (<u>31:14</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah,</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>31:15</u>):</p>\n<p>And I would
  say on the flip side of acceptance is from the caretaker or partner or loved one
  perspective, particularly around eating disorder and treatment. And there might
  be acceptance of this might not look how I hope it looks. I do see a fair amount
  of parents that are kind of cheerleaders and they’re like, you got this and you’re
  strong and you’re smart. And just plow through it and kind of like, let’s talk about
  the reality of, or the possibility if we even just talk about impossibility, what
  if it isn’t done in eight weeks? What if it isn’t done in three months? What if
  your child has to defer school? What if they make that choice? So I think that’s
  a piece that loved ones really the acceptance around that can be really hard to
  come to.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>32:18</u>):</p>\n<p>Definitely. Yeah, there’s a
  lot that we’re getting at in this. I was thinking when we were talking about that
  acceptance piece of some on the client side where there there’s this fantasy, I
  wish my mom, I wish my dad could be kind of exactly this way or come alongside this
  new way of thinking around health at every size or weight inclusion and kind of
  live and breathe it themselves. And if they can’t, I can’t be in relationship with
  almost this kind of black and white. You’re either doing it fully or how could I
  bear to be in relationship with you? And if we come across a limit of a parent isn’t
  ready to change the way that they view food and body, I think as an FRTI often,
  I want to give a lot of freedom to the loved one. They get to make their own choices.
  But from a client’s perspective, I think some of the work we might be doing is grief,
  grief work to, even if we can’t grieve that, then it’s hard to get to a place of
  acceptance. And when we get to acceptance, we can live in more of the gray of, I
  can still now actually appreciate some of the lovely pieces of my parent and not
  just be angry all the time that they’re not exactly this vision of perfection that
  they might want. So</p>\n<p>(<u>33:52</u>):</p>\n<p>That can be really meaningful
  work</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>33:56</u>):</p>\n<p>Accessing the grief. Also grief
  in the example I was using from the parent side of realizing that your child may
  not be living the life that you had hoped for or envisioned for them and getting
  to the grief in that too. And even with the client, they’re probably not living
  the life they had envisioned for themselves either many times. So getting to the
  grief, I think, yeah, grief is a huge part of this work. Totally,</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi
  (<u>34:28</u>):</p>\n<p>Yes. Okay. Well, let’s change gears a bit and talk a little
  bit about, I mentioned earlier our recent shift towards working with more adolescents
  and starting to work with adolescents age 16 and older. And we’ve worked with Opal
  anywhere from age now We have a 17. We we’ve had 70th through 17 all the way up
  to 74. So I’d love to talk about how relationship therapy might change what that
  could look like through these different developmental stages because obviously an
  adolescent, their brain is developed, they’re not fully formed adults, and then
  all the way up to 74 and thinking about end life back more in an end of life type
  of approaching that stage. Yeah. Is there anything you’d want to share about patterns
  or thematic things that might look a little different from an age perspective?</p>\n<p>Nikki
  Wolf (<u>35:30</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah, I mean, I love working with all systems, but
  I feel like I have special place for families of young adults, particularly those
  who are preparing for launch or mid-launch. It is a really challenging time of parenthood
  and still requires a lot of attunement, but in a way that is a lot more confusing
  than when they’re 12 or in pre-adolescence. I had say for the 16, 17 year olds,
  they’re still living at home. There’s still an authority relationship with caretakers
  that is hopefully lessening as they get to 18, 19, 20. And of course it’s developmentally
  appropriate for people this age to be looking more outside of the family system
  for validation, connection, all that kind of stuff. So it’s like how do we do that
  dance? And also there’s this idea that when our kids turn 18, it means something
  like they’re fine now. They’re adults, they’re going to college. Maybe they’re not
  adults. They’re not adults yet.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>37:04</u>):</p>\n<p>I have
  an 18-year-old right now who is graduating in a month. I’m right on it.</p>\n<p>Nikki
  Wolf (<u>37:10</u>):</p>\n<p>I have a 21-year-old, and she’s of course different
  than an 18. And there’s still a lot of management happening. And so I love to work
  with parents and caretakers that are in that phase to kind of be like, well, there’s
  grief here because you’re soon to be an empty nester or your kids are growing up,
  they don’t need you in the same way. And just noting, this is when I went back to
  grad school because this is when I switched careers, so let’s acknowledge that,
  but your child is wanting independence and freedom. And so we want to also honor
  that. I think kids, sorry, the young adults sometimes are kind of like, I just want
  ’em to leave me stop texting, so stop. And I’m like, Hey, they’re not going to stop
  caring just because you’re turning 18. They have needs too. So working in that system
  to find the balance, and maybe it changes week to week, but having that line of
  communication open in a way that works for both people and there’s an eating disorder
  involved and there’s an eating disorder.</p>\n<p>(<u>38:36</u>):</p>\n<p>I’m even
  mentioning the eating disorder. So then there’s that. Yeah, and I think that with
  the younger clients having the eating disorder component too, there is kind of more
  of the parental control, parental authority, but we’re still walking that line of
  they are going to be launching soon if that’s their vision, if that’s what everybody’s
  hoping for. And so how are we going to do that? And it’s challenging and I really
  like doing that, and I don’t think that there is a lot of focus on that piece of
  it is of both things are true and valid. And I’ve heard from some caretakers that
  there is talking about acceptance and grief of realizing there’s a point where they
  just have to let go of any control or expectation and realize that your kid’s going
  to live your life and hopefully they’re just doing the best they can and you don’t
  want them suffering and struggling. And if they are, there’s only so much you can
  do to change that for them. So that’s the younger folks,</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>39:53</u>):</p>\n<p>And
  maybe I’d add in that or ask a question for parents that are going through that
  launching phase or the young adult side and then their kid has an eating disorder.
  I think the intuition would be like, now I am getting more involved again because
  they are sick, they are ill, they need help. I’m their parent. I care, of course,
  I care deeply about my child who is suffering, and yet they’re still in that stage.
  And I think that is just this weird, so it’s already so layered if somebody isn’t
  is well and launching because obviously they still need things. My daughter still
  needs things. They’re not fully independent. But then there’s this urge to parent
  more obviously when an eating disorder is there. So I guess would you, you be encouraging
  the parents in a system like that, they don’t have to double down on the</p>\n<p>Nikki
  Wolf (<u>40:58</u>):</p>\n<p>Caretaking? Yeah, I mean I actually see this not even
  with just the minor clients, but clients who are young adult and have been in adolescent
  treatment where there’s a heavy focus on parent involvement and support, and parents
  are essentially controlling. They’re in charge of the food and all the care at home,
  and then they turn 18 and they come to adult treatment and we’re like, guess what?
  We don’t have to tell you stuff anymore. And that is really, really, really hard.
  So sorry, I forgot your question. I don’t know where I was going.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi
  (<u>41:40</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah, I was just curious if you would basically say you
  don’t double. There is still part of letting go and working through a launch and
  it seems so confusing for a parent of how do I navigate that? Am I just letting
  my child flounder as they’re off in college? Do they just need to be home and nurtured
  by me 24 7?</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>42:10</u>):</p>\n<p>I think it’s sort of like
  there’s still maybe a doubling down for a period of time, and then the work is gradually
  handing it back to the client and then we are here to help you if you need help.
  If they get to the point where they go through treatment and they’re feeling well
  enough to go off to college and then they go to college and they tank, it’s being
  available being we’re here to help you. We will be there. We’re going to check in.
  Maybe that’s the agreement that we’re trying to come to is how much of your parents’
  attention is feeling like enough or too much? And from the caretaker’s end, how
  much and response do you need from your loved one, from your kid to know that they’re
  okay? And so coming to that agreement, and I think that many parents do want that
  launch to happen and obviously for their child to be well to do it, and maybe talking
  about what does well look like to you and what if they’re recovered enough in the
  moment or maybe they could use more treatment, but they’re choosing to not defer
  school or go to school.</p>\n<p>(<u>43:36</u>):</p>\n<p>So how are we going to address
  that? So yeah, right now there are, because we get so many 18 to 25-year-old clients,
  there are many cycling through my head right now, including younger and things that
  we’ve focused on with them. And I would say that more often than not, the caretaker’s
  desire is for their child to be launching and trying to get to a place where they
  feel stable enough that that can happen safely.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>44:17</u>):</p>\n<p>And
  like you said, that negotiation, there isn’t one way of doing that negotiation.</p>\n<p>(<u>44:21</u>):</p>\n<p>It’s
  going to look so different for any kid and parent system. There isn’t one. How much
  support is the family system giving so varying depending on the unique individuals
  at play. And I would also say a thing that comes up frequently is the support that
  a parent gives or support a loved one gives isn’t static. It’s going to change what
  the loved one needs can change. So week to week, day to day, we always get the what
  can I do to support, what can I do to help? There isn’t just this program you do
  for the next two years, it’s ever evolving. It does require a lot of communication.
  It does require the person struggling with the eating disorder to communicate that
  to the loved one. You don’t have to guess. It’s not about reading somebody’s mind.
  It really does. That’s what we as providers are helping our clients do is how to
  share, connect with what they need and share it with the people in their life so
  that the loved ones don’t have to do all the guesswork</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>45:29</u>):</p>\n<p>Because</p>\n<p>Kara
  Bazzi (<u>45:29</u>):</p>\n<p>That’s not helpful.</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>45:30</u>):</p>\n<p>I
  think that actually is a theme that comes up a lot, particularly with in marriages
  and partnerships, like romantic partnerships of how will I know when my partner
  is struggling, what cues should I be looking about for? And I am like, we’re not
  mind readers because one person’s cues are not another person’s cues. So I can’t
  help you read their mind better. Sorry. So then we do talk about that direct communication,
  practicing direct communication. And it’s very nuanced too. Some people think of
  it more as monitoring certain questions. How do you ask questions? What questions
  to ask? Because hey, don’t monitor me. Don’t ask me questions about my food. Don’t
  ask me questions about this. How much am I eating? And there are other people who
  are like, yeah, will you ask me questions about my food? And so there isn’t just
  that one</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>46:42</u>):</p>\n<p>Size does not fit all.</p>\n<p>Nikki
  Wolf (<u>46:43</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah. So that’s a thing we talk about a lot in the
  support group is because they’re like, how do I know? What are the red flags? And
  we have to say, well, I don’t know what your person’s red flags are. They know and
  hopefully are talking about that before they discharge. And maybe you could ask
  them why didn’t you ask them directly? And they may share and they may not.</p>\n<p>Kara
  Bazzi (<u>47:12</u>):</p>\n<p>That’s so true. Other, I know we’ve been talking about
  more that launching stage. Was there anything you did want to say about other life
  stages?</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>47:21</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah, I think my approach later
  in life, some people still do work with caretakers, parents and family of origin,
  but I’m thinking of some couples that I’ve worked with where we are talking still,
  we’re talking a lot about family of origin stuff. What have we learned about relationships
  from our families that we grew up in and how are we bringing that into this dynamic
  here? And I know that trauma has played a big role in that as well, trauma experiences.
  So how is that adding to dynamics that are coming up and patterns that are coming
  up? You mentioned we’ve had clients up to age 74 and I have worked with older couples
  and the generational influences are very real around diet, body food. So we may
  not be completely dismantling that stuff, but bringing in new ideas and new ways
  of interacting, communicating always comes back to that communication.</p>\n<p>Kara
  Bazzi (<u>48:36</u>):</p>\n<p>I mean, we could be talking about this all day. It’s
  very fun. We like talking about family therapy. Yeah, I love it. And I’m wondering
  if there’s anything just for now that you’d like to share that’s been missing from
  this conversation. Is there anything you’d want to make sure is kind of in the context
  of this episode?</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>48:56</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah, I think maybe
  I mentioned earlier about the system, and by system I mean whatever family unit
  or relationship unit probably should have said that earlier that you’re working
  with. But the unit being the client and a good family relationship therapist will
  not collude with either individual within that unit. And I think that’s really important.
  And it’s something I try to be really clear about when I start working with people,
  especially when there are parents involved, because they might want to email me
  and get information. And so I say, if you have questions, you can email me. Or if
  you have things you want to bring in, you’re not really sure how you want to bring
  them into session, you can let me know. But if you email me about other stuff, I’m
  going to respond and CC your loved one for transparency and say, this would be a
  great topic to discuss in our next session.</p>\n<p>(<u>49:57</u>):</p>\n<p>And
  because we’re in a unique situation with the higher level of care, we’re not outpatient
  providers. And if I were an outpatient provider, I would only be seeing the family
  once a week. I wouldn’t know about other aspects of their care. But because we’re
  a kind of a more closed system and we’re consulting all the time on a treatment
  team level, I do know more, but I let the family know that I’m not meeting with
  this person. They have their own individual therapist. They’re having sessions with
  their other providers as well. And so I am meeting with this client while I’m meeting
  with you. So I think that’s important for people to understand too, is how the attitude
  of the therapist coming in and how they’re holding the individuals within. Right,</p>\n<p>Kara
  Bazzi (<u>50:53</u>):</p>\n<p>Right. And I’m glad you said that because it does
  highlight that we did make that decision from the get-go with Opal to have a separate
  primary therapist and separated from the family and relationship therapist for that
  exact point that the family and relationship therapist is for everybody in the room.
  And we can’t have zero bias going in, and we will know a little bit more about the
  client, but it’s really important value of ours to be doing true family therapy,
  which would be that we are there for each person in the room. And so that’s why
  we set it up structurally to have a different therapist. And that may make us, I
  know maybe other treatment centers do that as well, but sometimes the treatment
  centers have the primary therapist be the family therapist, but that was, we chose
  not to go that direction for that exact reason. Yeah.</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>51:47</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah.
  I mean, for me personally, that would be a really rough line because sometimes even
  now I get information from the team and I’m kind of like, I can’t just bring that
  in. That needs to be brought in by the families. So it can be tricky, but I don’t
  personally feel like it’s hard for me. It’s just an interesting addition to what
  we’re doing. Totally.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>52:22</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah. Okay. Nikki,
  if our listeners are interested to learn more about family systems work from this
  awesome conversation with eating disorders, do you have any resources to point them
  to? Anything you want to say out loud that we can link in the show notes?</p>\n<p>Nikki
  Wolf (<u>52:37</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah. The Opal website, Opal Food and body.com has
  an FRT page family relationship therapy page. And there are a lot of resources for
  books, podcasts. It’s an evolving list, so things will continue to be added. And
  I am going to begin to offer an outpatient family and relationship therapy support
  group, just, which is, I’m calling it FRT Support Group 2.0, which is very similar
  to the one we offer in program, but it will be for outpatient. And that is a combination
  of learning, education and process. So just sharing experiences about what it’s
  like to be a support person of somebody going through this journey with some learning
  involved too. So that can be accessed by contacting me directly, nikki@wolfheartcounseling.net
  is my email address for people who are interested in, I do have a website under
  construction right now, and we’ll be up soon and then Feast the online forum geared
  more towards caretakers of adolescents as a good resource as well.</p>\n<p>Kara
  Bazzi (<u>53:57</u>):</p>\n<p>Great. Yeah. Awesome. Well, thank you for being in
  this conversation today on our podcast. It</p>\n<p>Nikki Wolf (<u>54:03</u>):</p>\n<p>Was
  fun. Thank you for having me talk about</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>54:04</u>):</p>\n<p>All
  things family relationships, and if you’re again interested in these resources,
  Nikki sharing, it’ll be linked in the show notes. If you’re interested in Opal and

---

Eating disorders are intricately linked to relationships and can significantly influence both the onset and recovery from these disorders. In a recent episode of *The Appetite* podcast, Kara Bazzi, co-founder and clinical director of Opal, converses with therapist Nikki Wolf about the importance of relationship therapy in treating eating disorders. They emphasize that support from loved ones can either facilitate healing or exacerbate the condition.

Wolf highlights that many supporters often approach the situation with a desire to "fix" their loved one, which can lead to misunderstandings. Instead, she advocates for fostering open communication and emotional expression, focusing on validating feelings rather than problem-solving. The family system is seen as a collective client in therapy sessions, where both the individual with the eating disorder and their family members must navigate complex dynamics.

Therapists aim to disrupt harmful patterns and encourage more genuine connections by observing interactions and addressing underlying emotions. By teaching skills such as listening and empathy, families can learn to support each other more effectively, creating a healthier environment for recovery.
