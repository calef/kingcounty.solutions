Eating disorders are intricately linked to relationships, and they can significantly influence both the onset and recovery from these disorders. In a recent episode of The Appetite podcast, Kara Bazzi, Co-Founder and Clinical Director of Opal, converses with therapist Nikki Wolf about the importance of relationship therapy in treating eating disorders. They emphasize that support from loved ones can either facilitate healing or exacerbate the condition. 

Wolf highlights that many supporters often approach the situation with a desire to "fix" their loved one, which can lead to misunderstandings. Instead, she advocates for fostering open communication and emotional expression, focusing on validating feelings rather than problem-solving. The family system is seen as a collective client in therapy sessions, where both the individual with the eating disorder and their family members must navigate complex dynamics. 

Therapists aim to disrupt harmful patterns and encourage more genuine connections by observing interactions and addressing underlying emotions. By teaching skills such as listening and empathy, families can learn to support each other more effectively, creating a healthier environment for recovery.
