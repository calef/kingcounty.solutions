Seattle's water supply outlook has improved with recent rainfall replenishing mountain reservoirs, although levels remain below normal for this time of year. The drinking water in the Seattle area is sourced from the Cedar and Tolt River watersheds, which rely on seasonal rains and snowpack. Early fall rains primarily soak into dry soil, necessitating consistent rainfall to refill reservoirs. 

To conserve water during this replenishing phase, residents are encouraged to follow several tips: turn off sprinkler systems as rainfall is sufficient, take shorter showers instead of baths, fix any leaks to prevent water wastage, upgrade to water-efficient fixtures, and use brooms instead of hoses for cleaning outdoor areas. 

Seattle Public Utilities provides weekly updates on water supply conditions and offers additional resources for water-saving tips.
