  Justin works at a local nonprofit that helps people experiencing homelessness – who live in their vehicles – find shelter, services, and eventually permanent housing. He is passionate about his work because he has real empathy for the people he serves — he used to live on the street himself.

Justin, who now works for a nonprofit assisting people experiencing homelessness, reflects on his own journey from living on the streets to finding stability. After nearly a decade of homelessness, he discovered Compass while seeking resources like showers. Though he didn't find housing immediately, Compass remained a trusted resource for him. The presence of a chapel at the Compass Center resonated deeply with Justin, reinforcing his faith during difficult times.

After four more years on the streets, he returned to the Ballard neighborhood, which he found comforting and supportive. With help from Compass, he achieved sobriety and moved into Nyer, where he began utilizing additional resources, including healthcare partnerships. Once stable, Justin sought to give back to the community that had supported him. Drawing on his experiences, he found work at a nonprofit focused on outreach to those experiencing homelessness.

Justin emphasizes the importance of community support and aims to be a source of hope for others. Compass remains dedicated to providing essential services, emergency shelters, and affordable housing, ensuring everyone has a safe place to call home, even if it takes years to reach that goal.
