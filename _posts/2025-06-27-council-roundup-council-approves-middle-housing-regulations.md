  Bellevue partners with county to launch Community Court

  The City of Bellevue is partnering with King County District Court to launch a Community Court here, likely in mid-July. The court will convene at the Bellevue Library and is intended to address the root causes behind low-level, nonviolent misdemeanor crimes.

  At Tuesday’s meeting, District Court Presiding Judge Rebecca Robertson delivered a State of the Court presentation, highlighting court structure, key priorities, caseload statistics and updates – most notably the launch of the Bellevue Community Court and Resource Center.

  Shown to deliver many benefits including reduced recidivism, which leads to the use of fewer judicial resources, community court is an alternative to traditional court for eligible, nonviolent, less-serious misdemeanor cases. City staff discussed the need and purpose of Community Court, which is to increase safety for everyone by holding community court clients accountable, while helping them improve their lives. Community courts work to identify and address the underlying challenges people face that often contribute to involvement with the criminal justice system, reducing recidivism. &nbsp;

  Community Court is the result of a partnership between several city departments, District Court, the King County Library System and a number of community providers. The library will host the weekly court and provide space for a resource center, making it easier for individuals to access help and support. Similar courts are already operating in Auburn, Redmond and Shoreline/Kenmore with demonstrated effectiveness.

  Volunteer opportunities

  Community Court relies on volunteers to help with weekly operations and support services. Learn about [available opportunities](https://bellevuewa.gov/volunteering/bellevue-community-court-volunteer-opportunities).

The Bellevue City Council approved updates to the city’s housing policies to comply with new state laws aimed at expanding housing options. These changes align with House Bills 1110 and 1337, which mandate greater residential density and a variety of housing types. Key amendments include reducing the distance near transit for building six units, lowering maximum building heights for middle housing, and limiting the size of cottage housing. A fee-in-lieu option for developers was also established, allowing them to pay to build up to six units while maintaining parking requirements with exemptions near major transit.

Additionally, the council announced a partnership with King County District Court to launch a Community Court, set to begin in mid-July at the Bellevue Library. This court will address low-level, nonviolent misdemeanor crimes by focusing on the underlying causes of criminal behavior, aiming to reduce recidivism and judicial resource use. The council also proclaimed July as Disability Pride Month and Parks and Recreation Month. The next council meeting is scheduled for July 15, with the meetings on July 1 and July 8 canceled.
