The Bellevue City Council approved updates to the city’s housing policies to comply with new state laws aimed at expanding housing options. These changes align with House Bills 1110 and 1337, which mandate greater residential density and a variety of housing types. Key amendments include reducing the distance near transit for building six units, lowering maximum building heights for middle housing, and limiting the size of cottage housing. A fee-in-lieu option for developers was also established, allowing them to pay to build up to six units while maintaining parking requirements with exemptions near major transit.

Additionally, the council announced a partnership with King County District Court to launch a Community Court, set to begin in mid-July at the Bellevue Library. This court will address low-level, nonviolent misdemeanor crimes by focusing on the underlying causes of criminal behavior, aiming to reduce recidivism and judicial resource use. The council also proclaimed July as Disability Pride Month and Parks and Recreation Month. The next council meeting is scheduled for July 15, with the meetings on July 1 and July 8 canceled.
