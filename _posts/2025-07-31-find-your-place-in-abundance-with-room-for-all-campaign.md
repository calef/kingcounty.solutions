The Rainier Valley Food Bank (RVFB) has successfully raised $16 million for its "Room for All" campaign, aimed at transforming a former warehouse into a community food hub in South Seattle, with $1 million still needed to reach the total goal. Sue Levitt and Ellen Ferguson have pledged to match new donations up to $250,000 in memory of Bill Block, an advocate for those facing food and housing insecurity. The new facility, opening on September 7th, will be 11,000 square feet—over nine times larger than RVFB's previous location—and will offer vital services like food storage, a commercial kitchen, and a grocery store. The hub aims to expand programs, improve community health, and foster relationships among guests and volunteers, emphasizing the importance of community involvement. Gloria Hatcher-Mays, RVFB's Executive Director, noted that every effort, whether through donations or volunteer work, contributes to a sense of abundance. The campaign is co-chaired by notable community leaders, and RVFB currently serves over 8,000 families annually, distributing more than 1 million pounds of food. As the community faces growing needs, RVFB's expansion is deemed crucial for continued support.
