Depression and anxiety are the two most prevalent mental health issues in the U.S., often co-occurring and sharing overlapping symptoms such as racing thoughts, insomnia, irritability, and mood swings. These conditions can significantly affect physical health, relationships, and overall quality of life. A viable treatment option for individuals facing both disorders is dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), which combines individual and group therapy, along with on-call support from therapists. DBT focuses on coping strategies that enhance mindfulness, emotional regulation, interpersonal effectiveness, and distress tolerance.

The reasons for the co-occurrence of depression and anxiety include shared risk factors such as adverse childhood experiences, chronic stress, altered neural pathways affecting emotional regulation, and genetic predispositions. Individual therapy in DBT helps clients track their use of skills and address the underlying causes of their mental health struggles, fostering self-awareness and long-term healing. Group therapy offers a supportive environment, allowing participants to connect with others facing similar challenges and practice DBT skills collaboratively. DBT equips individuals with tools to manage their symptoms, build resilience, and engage more fully in life, providing essential support for those dealing with depression and anxiety.
