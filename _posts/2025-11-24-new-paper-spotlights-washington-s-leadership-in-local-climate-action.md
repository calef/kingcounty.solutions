topics: []
---

A new paper in *Weather, Climate, and Society* highlights Washington's leadership in local climate action through the implementation of HB 1181, which integrates climate goals into the Growth Management Act. Co-authored by Commerce planners and partners, the article emphasizes how Washington's growth-management tools, financial incentives, and regulatory frameworks serve as a model for other states. The findings showcase how the Washington State Department of Commerce's planning guidance and grants assist cities and counties in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and vehicle miles traveled, building resilience against climate-related hazards, and engaging diverse stakeholders for sustained local action. The co-authors include Commerce representatives Michael Burnham, Sarah Fox, and Pranjali Rai, alongside contributors from BERK Consulting and Cascadia Consulting Group. Following the conclusion of its HB 1181 rulemaking, Commerce plans to publish updated climate planning guidance in December.
