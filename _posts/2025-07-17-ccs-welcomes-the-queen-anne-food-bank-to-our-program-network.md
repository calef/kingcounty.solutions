  <p>On a warm July afternoon, the Queen Anne Food Bank opens its doors wide to a line of neighbors that winds through the parking lot and down the block. Everyone is welcomed with a smile by Food Bank staff and volunteers, leaving with a nourishing bag of groceries handed to them by a member of the Food Bank team.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>These visitors have arrived for the Queen Anne Food Bank’s weekly grocery pick up, which the Food Bank offers in addition to fresh meals distributed every weekday. Nestled in the heart of Seattle’s Queen Anne neighborhood, just steps from the Climate Pledge Arena and the Pacific Science Center, the Food Bank serves an average of 125 people every day. Their message is simple and heart-felt: “Come if you’re hungry.”&nbsp;</p>

On July 1, 2025, the Queen Anne Food Bank officially joined Catholic Community Services (CCS), becoming part of a network of over 190 programs across Western Washington. Located in Seattle's Queen Anne neighborhood, the Food Bank serves around 125 people daily, providing weekly grocery pickups and daily fresh meals. Its mission is to support those in need with a warm invitation: “Come if you’re hungry.” This partnership with CCS aims to enhance and sustain the Food Bank's essential services, connecting guests to additional resources like shelters and mental health services.

The Food Bank, originally a ministry of the Sacred Heart of Jesus Church, plays a vital role in addressing food insecurity, especially with recent cuts to the federal SNAP program. Under the management of Steve Kreins, a dedicated staff member with over a decade of experience, the Food Bank offers not only groceries and fresh meals but also hygiene items and winter supplies. As the demand for food assistance rises, the Queen Anne Food Bank is crucial in providing nutrition and compassion to the local community. Volunteers are encouraged to help with meal preparation and service during weekdays.
