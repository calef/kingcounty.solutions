On July 1, 2025, the Queen Anne Food Bank officially joined Catholic Community Services (CCS), becoming part of a network of over 190 programs across Western Washington. Located in Seattle's Queen Anne neighborhood, the Food Bank serves around 125 people daily, providing weekly grocery pickups and daily fresh meals. Its mission is to support those in need with a warm invitation: “Come if you’re hungry.” This partnership with CCS aims to enhance and sustain the Food Bank's essential services, connecting guests to additional resources like shelters and mental health services.

The Food Bank, originally a ministry of the Sacred Heart of Jesus Church, plays a vital role in addressing food insecurity, especially with recent cuts to the federal SNAP program. Under the management of Steve Kreins, a dedicated staff member with over a decade of experience, the Food Bank offers not only groceries and fresh meals but also hygiene items and winter supplies. As the demand for food assistance rises, the Queen Anne Food Bank is crucial in providing nutrition and compassion to the local community. Volunteers are encouraged to help with meal preparation and service during weekdays.
