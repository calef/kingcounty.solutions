Wellspring Family Services is transitioning its Employee Assistance Program (EAP) to CuraLinc Healthcare, effective December 2, 2024. This decision reflects Wellspring's long-standing commitment to preventing and ending family homelessness while adapting to the evolving needs of the community. The transition aims to enhance the EAP's legacy of care and excellence, ensuring continuity of support for client organizations and their employees. Peter Schultz, interim CEO of Wellspring, highlighted that CuraLinc was selected due to its alignment with Wellspring's values and its reputation for compassionate support. The EAP, which has been integral to Wellspring's mission for decades, will now operate under CuraLinc, allowing Wellspring to concentrate on its core services, including Housing Services, the Early Learning Center, the Family Store, and the Employee Stability Program. This strategic move positions Wellspring to further its impact and support families in crisis, backed by a stable financial foundation and a renewed focus on its family services.
