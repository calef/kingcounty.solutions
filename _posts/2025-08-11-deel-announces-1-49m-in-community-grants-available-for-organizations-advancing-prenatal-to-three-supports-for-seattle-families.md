The Seattle Department of Education and Early Learning (DEEL) has announced the availability of $1.49 million in community grants for organizations focused on prenatal-to-three supports. Applications are open until September 8 for funding amounts up to $298,000, aimed at enhancing healthy birth outcomes and early childhood development for children aged birth to three and their caregivers. The grants, funded by the City’s Sweetened Beverage Tax, prioritize organizations that demonstrate a commitment to racial equity and serve underrepresented populations. 

DEEL's funding strategy is designed to address educational disparities and promote kindergarten readiness. This year’s grant program is open to both new applicants and previous recipients looking to expand their initiatives. DEEL will provide resources such as a pre-recorded information session and technical assistance for applicants. In 2024, five organizations received similar grants, providing culturally responsive services including doula care, lactation support, and parenting groups. Since its inception in 2021, the PN3 Community Grant has invested nearly $6 million, benefiting over 1,500 caregivers and emphasizing the importance of culturally congruent support for families.
