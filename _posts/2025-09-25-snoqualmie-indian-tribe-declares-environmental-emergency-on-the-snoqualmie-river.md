  _Tribe urges partners to support and participate in their efforts to protect and restore flows in the Snoqualmie River._

  [Snoqualmie, WA] The Snoqualmie Indian Tribal Council has determined that environmental conditions in the Snoqualmie River watershed are severe enough to warrant a Tribal Declaration of Emergency.

  The Snoqualmie River is in dire condition: flow in the river is at record low levels; minimum instream flows established in state rules have not been met for many years; ongoing water uses exceed the natural water supply; and ecosystem conditions are worsening due to persistent drought conditions and low snowpack.

  [Read the full declaration here](https://snoqualmietribe.us/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Declaration-of-Environmental-Emergency-1.pdf). The persistent and recurring critical conditions and ongoing uses of water pose a serious threat to the health, safety, and welfare of the members of the Snoqualmie Tribe and the ecosystems that sustain them; interfere with Snoqualmie Tribal Members’ exercise of their rights; and, impede the Tribal Council’s sovereign regulation of and jurisdiction over its own affairs.

  _The Snoqualmie Indian Tribe is a federally recognized tribe in the Puget Sound region of Washington State. Known as the People of the Moon, Snoqualmie were signatories to the Treaty of Point Elliott in 1855. For more information visit www.snoqualmietribe.us_

The Snoqualmie Indian Tribe has declared an environmental emergency on the Snoqualmie River. The Tribal Council determined that the river's conditions have worsened significantly, with record low flow levels, unmet minimum instream flows for many years, and water usage exceeding the natural supply. The ecosystem's health is deteriorating due to persistent drought and low snowpack. These conditions pose a significant threat to the tribe's health, safety, and welfare, interfere with their rights, and impede the Tribal Council’s regulation of its own affairs. The tribe urges partners to support their efforts to protect and restore the river.
