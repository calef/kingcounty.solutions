Alcohol intoxication results from consuming alcohol faster than the body can metabolize it, leading to various physical and mental impairments. Symptoms include slurred speech, impaired judgment, and decreased coordination. The severity of intoxication is influenced by factors such as body weight, tolerance, and the amount of alcohol consumed.

Withdrawal from alcohol occurs when a person who has been drinking heavily suddenly reduces or stops intake. Symptoms can manifest within hours to a few days after cessation and range from mild anxiety and tremors to severe complications such as seizures and delirium tremens, which can be life-threatening. Medical supervision is often necessary during withdrawal due to the risk of these severe symptoms.

Treatment for alcohol use disorder typically involves detoxification, therapy, and support groups. Medication-assisted treatment can also be beneficial in managing cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Understanding the effects of alcohol intoxication and withdrawal is crucial for those seeking help and for their families, emphasizing the need for comprehensive treatment approaches to support recovery.
