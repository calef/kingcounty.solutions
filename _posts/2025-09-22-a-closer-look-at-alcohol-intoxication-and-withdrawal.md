  can negatively affect almost every organ and system in your body. Drinking too much
  or for a long period of time can have deleterious consequences for your physical,
  mental, and emotional health. And alcohol’s effects don’t just stop if you quit
  drinking. Alcohol withdrawal can be uncomfortable, risky, and even life-threatening
  without the proper support and care. That’s why it’s important to know what alcohol
  intoxication symptoms are, what alcohol does to your health, and what can happen
  when you stop or reduce your drinking.</p>\n<h2>Moderate Drinking vs. Intoxication</h2>\n<p>The
  <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/about-alcohol-use/moderate-alcohol-use.html\">CDC
  defines moderate drinking</a> as one drink or less per day for women and two drinks
  or less per day for men. Alcohol intoxication happens when you consume alcohol more
  quickly than your liver can metabolize it. Although the rate at which alcohol is
  metabolized by the body varies from person to person, in general, the liver can
  process one ounce of alcohol, or one standard drink, per hour. Factors that affect
  your alcohol metabolism rate include your weight, your overall health, whether you’re
  male or female, genetics, and your tolerance for alcohol. The unprocessed alcohol
  remains in your bloodstream where it affects your brain and other organs. The amount
  of alcohol in your bloodstream is called blood alcohol content or BAC. A blood alcohol
  level of .08 is considered legally drunk in most states. But <a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/health/alcohol/blood-alcohol-level-chart#faq\">alcohol
  begins to affect you</a> long before your BAC reaches that level.</p>\n<h2>Alcohol
  Intoxication Symptoms</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/327202#symptoms\">signs
  of alcohol intoxication</a> can be mild, moderate, severe, and even life-threatening
  depending on how much you drink and how quickly. The stages of alcohol intoxication
  are determined by your BAC.</p>\n<p>Early signs of alcohol intoxication in adults
  begin when they are mildly intoxicated with a BAC of up to .05% and include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased
  body temperature</li>\n<li>Slightly decreased motor function</li>\n<li>Slightly
  decreased cognitive function</li>\n<li>Feeling relaxed</li>\n<li>Enhanced mood</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With
  a BAC between .06% and .15%, you’re moderately intoxicated with the following symptoms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Decreased
  inhibition and judgment</li>\n<li>Impaired speech and coordination</li>\n<li>Slowed
  reaction time</li>\n<li>Enhanced mood</li>\n<li>Decreased motor function</li>\n<li>Increased
  feelings of relaxation and mood elevation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Severe intoxication is
  considered a BAC between .16% and .3% with symptoms including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Blackouts</li>\n<li>Significantly
  impaired judgment, reaction time, speech, and motor function</li>\n<li>Short-term
  memory loss</li>\n<li>Slowed cognitive function</li>\n<li>Vomiting</li>\n<li>Loss
  of consciousness</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/22689-blood-alcohol-content-bac\">BAC
  above .3%</a> is considered life-threatening. At this level, you likely have alcohol
  poisoning, indicated by symptoms such as unconsciousness and respiratory distress.</p>\n<h2>Dangers
  of Alcohol Intoxication</h2>\n<p>Drinking to excess can be damaging to your health
  in many ways. Alcohol has negative effects on your entire body, not just your liver.
  Drinking too much can create the following <a href=\"https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/alcohols-effects-body\">health
  risks</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Changes in mood, behavior, and cognitive function</li>\n<li>The
  development of peripheral neuropathy, causing painful numbness and burning sensations
  in the limbs</li>\n<li>Increased risk of thyroid disease and diabetes</li>\n<li>Increased
  risk of several types of cancer, including colon cancer and breast cancer</li>\n<li>Increased
  risk of stroke and heart disease</li>\n<li>Diminished immune system</li>\n<li>Increased
  risk of liver disease including cirrhosis and cancer</li>\n<li>Increased susceptibility
  to pneumonia and tuberculosis</li>\n<li>Increased risk of pancreatitis</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because
  alcohol affects your balance, coordination, and reaction time, drinking too much
  also puts you at risk for injuries from falls, burns, and drowning. And the effect
  of alcohol on your ability to drive is well-known. According to the National Transportation
  Highway Safety Board, around <a href=\"https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/drunk-driving\">30%
  of all fatal crashes</a> in the United States involve drivers with a BAC of .08%
  or higher.</p>\n<p>Alcohol is also damaging to your mental health. Although people
  sometimes use alcohol to mask the symptoms of mental health issues, drinking to
  excess can actually <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/what-to-know-about-alcohol-and-mental-health\">make
  mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety worse</a>.</p>\n<h2>Alcohol
  Intoxication vs. Poisoning</h2>\n<p>Alcohol intoxication turns into alcohol poisoning
  when your blood alcohol content rises above .3%. <a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alcohol-poisoning/symptoms-causes/syc-20354386\">Alcohol
  poisoning</a> is a very serious and potentially fatal condition that results from
  drinking large amounts of alcohol in a short period of time. When the level of alcohol
  in your blood is extremely high, it affects the areas of your brain that control
  your <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/16640-alcohol-poisoning\">heart
  rate, body temperature, and breathing</a>. It’s important to know the signs and
  symptoms of alcohol poisoning so you can get help right away if you think someone
  you know has this condition. It’s also essential to remember that a person doesn’t
  need to have all these symptoms before you seek medical help. Signs of alcohol poisoning
  include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Vomiting</li>\n<li>Confusion</li>\n<li>Seizures</li>\n<li>Incontinence</li>\n<li>A
  delayed or absent gag reflex</li>\n<li>Breathing that is much slower than normal,
  fewer than eight breaths per minute</li>\n<li>Breathing that’s irregular with a
  pause of more than ten seconds between breaths</li>\n<li>Cold, clammy, blue, gray,
  or unusually pale skin</li>\n<li>Decreased body temperature</li>\n<li>Inability
  to stay awake</li>\n<li>If unconscious, the inability to be roused</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The
  last two symptoms are especially dangerous and are sure signs to call 911 or get
  help immediately. Because of the way that alcohol poisoning affects the gag reflex,
  a person suffering from alcohol poisoning, whether conscious or unconscious, is
  at risk of vomiting and choking. Never leave an unconscious person by themselves.
  Try to keep them sitting up and awake. Never try to induce vomiting as that can
  be a choking hazard.</p>\n<p>Drinking so much you end up with alcohol poisoning
  is a sign that you have alcohol use disorder and possibly a wake-up call that you
  need to do something about your drinking. But if you’ve been regularly drinking
  to excess, quitting cold turkey on your own can be dangerous.</p>\n<h2>Withdrawal
  from Alcohol</h2>\n<p>Around <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/alcohol-withdrawal\">29
  million adults</a> in the United States have alcohol use disorder (AUD), making
  it the most common substance use disorder. <a href=\"https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2021/0900/p253.html\">Research</a>
  shows that about half of people with alcohol use disorder who suddenly stop or reduce
  their drinking will experience alcohol withdrawal symptoms. The more you drink,
  the more likely you are to suffer from alcohol detox symptoms when you quit. The
  severity of your symptoms will depend on several individual factors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How
  long you’ve been drinking</li>\n<li>How much you’ve been drinking</li>\n<li>What
  stage of addiction you’re experiencing</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Alcohol Withdrawal Symptoms</h2>\n<p><a
  href=\"https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000764.htm\">Withdrawal symptoms</a>
  usually start between six and 24 hours of your last drink. Symptoms range from mild
  to severe. Mild alcohol withdrawal symptoms include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Headache</li>\n<li>Irritability</li>\n<li>Anxiety</li>\n<li>Feeling
  “jumpy”</li>\n<li>Fatigue</li>\n<li>Depression</li>\n<li>Insomnia</li>\n<li>Mood
  swings</li>\n<li>Nausea and vomiting</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you’ve been drinking heavily
  and/or for a long period of time, you may experience a dangerous form of alcohol
  withdrawal called delirium tremens. Delirium tremens, also known as the DTs, usually
  develops between one and four days after withdrawal begins and can be life-threatening
  if not properly treated. Symptoms include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hallucinations</li>\n<li>Confusion</li>\n<li>Disorientation</li>\n<li>Seizures</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For
  between five and 25% of people, going through <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6761825/\">delirium
  tremens is fatal</a>.</p>\n<p>If you’re a long-time drinker, have been through detox
  before, have a history of seizures or DTs, or have strong cravings for alcohol,
  you’re at an increased risk for developing delirium tremens when you quit drinking.
  For this reason, it’s always a good idea to seek professional help when stopping
  or reducing the amount of alcohol you drink.</p>\n<h2>Alcohol Withdrawal Timeline</h2>\n<p>Detox
  is different for everyone because it depends on your unique circumstances, but in
  general, this is the <a href=\"https://www.ccjm.org/content/ccjom/83/1/67.full.pdf\">timeline
  for alcohol withdrawal</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Six to 12 hours: headache, mild anxiety,
  upset stomach, insomnia</li>\n<li>12 to 24 hours: hallucinations that typically
  resolve within 48 hours</li>\n<li>24 to 48 hours: seizures</li>\n<li>48 to 72 hours:

  can be tempting to think that you can handle quitting drinking on your own. But
  withdrawal symptoms can be uncomfortable at best and fatal at worst. Many people
  don’t have adequate alcohol withdrawal support at home. Detoxing through an alcohol
  withdrawal management program where you’re monitored and cared for by nurses, doctors,
  and addiction specialists is not only safer and more comfortable, but it also gives

  Alcohol can negatively affect almost every organ and system in your body. Drinking too much or for a long period of time can have deleterious consequences for your physical, mental, and emotional health. And alcohol’s effects don’t just stop if you quit drinking. Alcohol withdrawal can be uncomfortable, risky, and even life-threatening without the proper support and care. That’s why it’s important to know what alcohol intoxication symptoms are, what alcohol does to your health, and what can happen when you stop or reduce your drinking.

  ## Moderate Drinking vs. Intoxication

  The [CDC defines moderate drinking](https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/about-alcohol-use/moderate-alcohol-use.html) as one drink or less per day for women and two drinks or less per day for men. Alcohol intoxication happens when you consume alcohol more quickly than your liver can metabolize it. Although the rate at which alcohol is metabolized by the body varies from person to person, in general, the liver can process one ounce of alcohol, or one standard drink, per hour. Factors that affect your alcohol metabolism rate include your weight, your overall health, whether you’re male or female, genetics, and your tolerance for alcohol. The unprocessed alcohol remains in your bloodstream where it affects your brain and other organs. The amount of alcohol in your bloodstream is called blood alcohol content or BAC. A blood alcohol level of .08 is considered legally drunk in most states. But [alcohol begins to affect you](https://www.healthline.com/health/alcohol/blood-alcohol-level-chart#faq) long before your BAC reaches that level.

  ## Alcohol Intoxication Symptoms

  The [signs of alcohol intoxication](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/327202#symptoms) can be mild, moderate, severe, and even life-threatening depending on how much you drink and how quickly. The stages of alcohol intoxication are determined by your BAC.

  Early signs of alcohol intoxication in adults begin when they are mildly intoxicated with a BAC of up to .05% and include:

  - Increased body temperature
  - Slightly decreased motor function
  - Slightly decreased cognitive function
  - Feeling relaxed
  - Enhanced mood

  With a BAC between .06% and .15%, you’re moderately intoxicated with the following symptoms:

  - Decreased inhibition and judgment
  - Impaired speech and coordination
  - Slowed reaction time
  - Enhanced mood
  - Decreased motor function
  - Increased feelings of relaxation and mood elevation

  Severe intoxication is considered a BAC between .16% and .3% with symptoms including:

  - Blackouts
  - Significantly impaired judgment, reaction time, speech, and motor function
  - Short-term memory loss
  - Slowed cognitive function
  - Vomiting
  - Loss of consciousness

  A [BAC above .3%](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/22689-blood-alcohol-content-bac) is considered life-threatening. At this level, you likely have alcohol poisoning, indicated by symptoms such as unconsciousness and respiratory distress.

  ## Dangers of Alcohol Intoxication

  Drinking to excess can be damaging to your health in many ways. Alcohol has negative effects on your entire body, not just your liver. Drinking too much can create the following [health risks](https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/alcohols-effects-health/alcohols-effects-body):

  - Changes in mood, behavior, and cognitive function
  - The development of peripheral neuropathy, causing painful numbness and burning sensations in the limbs
  - Increased risk of thyroid disease and diabetes
  - Increased risk of several types of cancer, including colon cancer and breast cancer
  - Increased risk of stroke and heart disease
  - Diminished immune system
  - Increased risk of liver disease including cirrhosis and cancer
  - Increased susceptibility to pneumonia and tuberculosis
  - Increased risk of pancreatitis

  Because alcohol affects your balance, coordination, and reaction time, drinking too much also puts you at risk for injuries from falls, burns, and drowning.

According to the National Transportation Highway Safety Board, around [30% of all fatal crashes](https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/drunk-driving) in the United States involve drivers with a BAC of .08% or higher.

  Alcohol is also damaging to your mental health. Although people sometimes use alcohol to mask the symptoms of mental health issues, drinking to excess can actually [make mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety worse](https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/addiction/what-to-know-about-alcohol-and-mental-health).

  - Breathing that’s irregular with a pause of more than ten seconds between breaths
  - Cold, clammy, blue, gray, or unusually pale skin
  - Decreased body temperature
  - Inability to stay awake
  - If unconscious, the inability to be roused

  The last two symptoms are especially dangerous and are sure signs to call 911 or get help immediately.

Alcohol intoxication results from consuming alcohol faster than the body can metabolize it, leading to various physical and mental impairments. Symptoms include slurred speech, impaired judgment, and decreased coordination. The severity of intoxication is influenced by factors such as body weight, tolerance, and the amount of alcohol consumed.

Withdrawal from alcohol occurs when a person who has been drinking heavily suddenly reduces or stops intake. Symptoms can manifest within hours to a few days after cessation and range from mild anxiety and tremors to severe complications such as seizures and delirium tremens, which can be life-threatening. Medical supervision is often necessary during withdrawal due to the risk of these severe symptoms.

Treatment for alcohol use disorder typically involves detoxification, therapy, and support groups. Medication-assisted treatment can also be beneficial in managing cravings and withdrawal symptoms. Understanding the effects of alcohol intoxication and withdrawal is crucial for those seeking help and for their families, emphasizing the need for comprehensive treatment approaches to support recovery.
