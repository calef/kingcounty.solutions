KBWB Operations LLC, doing business as Atrium Health and Senior Living, and its former CEO, Kevin Breslin, were sentenced for health care fraud and tax conspiracy by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin. Breslin received a 90-month prison sentence and was ordered to pay $146 million in restitution and $8.4 million in forfeiture, with the same penalties imposed on KBWB-Atrium. Both pled guilty to charges related to the operation of skilled nursing facilities, with Breslin's guilty plea occurring on December 17, 2024, and KBWB-Atrium's on January 21, 2025.

The government alleged that from January 2015 to September 2018, KBWB-Atrium diverted Medicare and Medicaid funds intended for resident care to cover personal expenses and failed to comply with federal regulations. This mismanagement resulted in inadequate care for nursing home residents and unpaid vendors. Additionally, they were accused of not paying employment taxes withheld from employees, jeopardizing their Social Security and Medicare benefits. The case highlights the commitment of various federal agencies to combat health care fraud and protect vulnerable populations.
