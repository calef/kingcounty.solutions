This week, King County Solutions tracked 64 public‑sector and nonprofit updates for the week ending November 29. From new transit investments and emergency food aid to veterans’ health and holiday giving, agencies and community groups are moving quickly to shore up basic needs and keep neighbors connected during a turbulent season.

### Veterans’ Health, Healing, and Belonging

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is spotlighting how care is becoming more flexible and veteran‑centered. Veterans who can’t get timely appointments at VA facilities can use the Community Care program, outlined in Navigating care in the community, to see local providers closer to home. A broader [Whole Health](https://news.va.gov/143062/whole-health-putting-veterans-at-center-of-care/) approach emphasizes what matters most to each veteran, integrating physical, mental, and spiritual health.

Several stories focus on cancer and mental health. A Navy veteran’s [breast cancer journey](https://news.va.gov/143194/journey-through-breast-cancer-power-of-va-care/), the profiles in [Veterans Triumph Over Breast Cancer](https://news.va.gov/143215/veterans-triumph-over-breast-cancer/), and an [Army veteran’s final chemotherapy](https://news.va.gov/143219/veteran-completes-final-chemotherapy-treatment/) milestone all underscore the importance of comprehensive oncology care and peer support. VA also reaffirms that [Women Veterans belong at VA](https://news.va.gov/143191/women-veterans-belong-at-va/) and urges veterans to seek help through resources highlighted in [How Veterans can find relief when life gets heavy](https://news.va.gov/143352/how-veterans-find-relief-life-heavy-heavier/) and [Mental health matters](https://news.va.gov/143233/mental-health-matters/).

### Veterans’ Economic Empowerment and Advocacy

Economic security remains a major theme. The VA’s weekly [Hiring Veterans](https://news.va.gov/143630/hiring-veterans-jobs-of-the-week-for-nov-24-2025/) roundup and a new skills‑mapping tool in [It takes two to hire well](https://news.va.gov/143607/map-military-experience-to-civilian-jobs/) help translate military experience into civilian jobs. Disabled American Veterans is expanding its [iTRAK training platform](https://www.dav.org/learn-more/news/2025/another-leap-forward-dav-expands-training-platform-to-volunteers/) to volunteers and promoting entrepreneurship through [Patriot Boot Camp](https://www.dav.org/learn-more/news/2025/empowering-veterans-as-business-founders/).

Locally, Compass Housing Alliance shares Frank’s story in [“I penalized myself by keeping it in.”](https://www.compasshousingalliance.org/2025/11/i-penalized-myself-by-keeping-it-in/), tracing his path from PTSD and homelessness to helping other veterans in Seattle. DAV also highlights ongoing toxic‑exposure advocacy in [Nuclear past haunts airmen](https://www.dav.org/learn-more/news/2025/nuclear-past-haunts-airmen-veterans-fight-for-toxic-exposure-recognition/), while VA’s [EHRnie the Eagle](https://news.va.gov/143580/ehrnie-the-eagle-takes-flight-to-boost-ehrm-awareness/) campaign aims to make electronic health record modernization more understandable to veterans.

### Housing, Homelessness, and Food Security Response

Budget decisions and legal actions are reshaping the housing landscape. The Low Income Housing Institute details [2026 Budget Wins](https://www.lihihousing.org/post/2026-budget-wins), including $10 million in Seattle rental assistance and new tiny house village funding in Tukwila. At the federal level, the Justice Department’s RealPage settlement, covered [here](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-requires-realpage-end-sharing-competitively-sensitive-information-and), targets rent‑setting software accused of inflating prices.

The Washington Department of Commerce highlights both statewide EV infrastructure grants in [transportation electrification funding](https://www.commerce.wa.gov/november-2025-transportation-electrification-open-funding-opportunities/) and supportive housing in Vancouver’s [Lincoln Place II](https://www.commerce.wa.gov/lincoln-place-ii-serving-unhoused-vancouver-residents-through-a-unique-healthcare-and-housing-partnership/). On the ground, Mary’s Place examines child homelessness in [breaking the cycle](https://www.marysplaceseattle.org/blog/breaking-the-cycle-supporting-children-experiencing-homelessnessnbsp), while Westside Neighbors Shelter asks for Thanksgiving volunteers in [It’s Thanksgiving!

In response to a federal SNAP shutdown, the City describes large‑scale food box distribution in [Coming Together to Support Students and Neighbors](https://greenspace.seattle.gov/2025/11/coming-together-to-support-students-and-neighbors-during-the-government-shutdown/) and additional food‑bank funding in [More than $1 million in food assistance](https://humaninterests.seattle.gov/2025/11/26/more-than-1-million-in-food-assistance-reaches-seattle-food-banks-meal-programs-during-snap-disruption/). Stories from the Hunger Intervention Program’s [Getting to know Dave](https://hungerintervention.org/2025/11/26/getting-to-know-dave/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=getting-to-know-dave), United Way’s [home grocery delivery](https://www.uwkc.org/breaking-the-cycle-of-poverty-news/meeting-our-neighbors-needs-with-home-grocery-delivery/), and Transforming Age’s [Mission Matters](https://transformingage.org/blog/mission-matters-thanksgiving-2025/) show how seniors and people with disabilities are relying on meal programs to stay housed and healthy.

### Cancer Support, Retreats, and Healing Narratives

Alongside VA cancer stories, Cancer Lifeline shares two powerful perspectives.
