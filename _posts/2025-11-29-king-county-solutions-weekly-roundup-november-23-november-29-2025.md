King County Solutions tracked 64 public-sector and nonprofit updates for the week ending November 29. As winter and the holidays arrive, this week’s news shows local governments, veterans’ groups, and community organizations moving quickly on health care, housing stability, and emergency food support—while also opening new ways for residents to plug in.

### Veteran health, healing, and support

The Department of Veterans Affairs is spotlighting how care is getting closer to home and more veteran-centered. Veterans who can’t get timely appointments at VA facilities can use the Community Care program to get treatment from local providers through [navigating care in the community](https://news.va.gov/143174/navigating-care-in-the-community/). At the same time, VA’s [Whole Health](https://news.va.gov/143062/whole-health-putting-veterans-at-center-of-care/) model emphasizes personalized, holistic care that includes mental, physical, and spiritual well-being.

Several stories underscore cancer care and survivorship. A Navy veteran’s experience in [breast cancer treatment](https://news.va.gov/143194/journey-through-breast-cancer-power-of-va-care/) and the broader profiles in [Veterans Triumph Over Breast Cancer](https://news.va.gov/143215/veterans-triumph-over-breast-cancer/) and an [Army veteran’s final chemotherapy](https://news.va.gov/143219/veteran-completes-final-chemotherapy-treatment/) highlight coordinated oncology, mental health, and peer support. Behind the scenes, VA’s [Intermediate Care Technicians](https://news.va.gov/143558/intermediate-care-technicians-steadfast-service/) are profiled for their role in complex care. VA is also reinforcing that [women veterans belong at VA](https://news.va.gov/143191/women-veterans-belong-at-va/), with expanded services and outreach, and reminding all veterans that [mental health matters](https://news.va.gov/143233/mental-health-matters/) and that help is available when [life gets heavy](https://news.va.gov/143352/how-veterans-find-relief-life-heavy-heavier/).

### Veteran empowerment: careers, entrepreneurship, and advocacy

Disabled American Veterans (DAV) is investing in training and leadership pipelines. Its iTRAK platform is being opened to volunteers through [Another leap forward](https://www.dav.org/learn-more/news/2025/another-leap-forward-dav-expands-training-platform-to-volunteers/), giving more advocates the tools to navigate complex benefits claims. DAV’s Patriot Boot Camp, covered in [Empowering veterans as business founders](https://www.dav.org/learn-more/news/2025/empowering-veterans-as-business-founders/), is helping veteran and military family entrepreneurs refine pitches, understand AI, and compete for startup funding, while [The future of DAV belongs to those who serve](https://www.dav.org/learn-more/news/2025/the-future-of-dav-belongs-to-those-who-serve/) calls veterans into visible community service and scholarship programs.

On the jobs front, VA’s [Hiring Veterans: Jobs of the week](https://news.va.gov/143630/hiring-veterans-jobs-of-the-week-for-nov-24-2025/) highlights openings at major employers, and a new skills-mapping tool in [It takes two to hire well](https://news.va.gov/143607/map-military-experience-to-civilian-jobs/) helps translate military experience into civilian roles. DAV also amplifies toxic exposure advocacy in [Nuclear past haunts airmen](https://www.dav.org/learn-more/news/2025/nuclear-past-haunts-airmen-veterans-fight-for-toxic-exposure-recognition/), backing legislation to recognize long-ignored harms. Inside VA, the EHR modernization effort gets a public-facing boost with [EHRnie the Eagle](https://news.va.gov/143580/ehrnie-the-eagle-takes-flight-to-boost-ehrm-awareness/), a mascot meant to demystify digital health record changes for veterans and staff.

### Housing, homelessness, and rental justice

Locally, the Low Income Housing Institute reports major [2026 budget wins](https://www.lihihousing.org/post/2026-budget-wins), including $10 million in Seattle rental assistance and King County funding for a new Tukwila tiny house village and operating support for existing villages—key tools for preventing evictions and expanding shelter capacity. In Vancouver, the Department of Commerce’s [Lincoln Place II](https://www.commerce.wa.gov/lincoln-place-ii-serving-unhoused-vancouver-residents-through-a-unique-healthcare-and-housing-partnership/) adds 40 permanent supportive housing units for people exiting homelessness with serious health needs, part of the statewide Apple Health and Homes Initiative.

At the federal level, the Department of Justice is targeting market and safety abuses that affect renters and homeowners. A proposed settlement would force RealPage, a major rent-pricing software provider, to change its practices under [Justice Department Requires RealPage to End the Sharing of Competitively Sensitive Information](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-requires-realpage-end-sharing-competitively-sensitive-information-and), while [Lowe’s Home Centers to Pay $12.5M Penalty](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/lowes-home-centers-pay-125m-penalty-lead-paint-violations-during-home-renovations) addresses lead-paint violations in home renovations. Stories from Mary’s Place on [children experiencing homelessness](https://www.marysplaceseattle.org/blog/breaking-the-cycle-supporting-children-experiencing-homelessnessnbsp) and Compass Housing Alliance’s veteran profile [“I penalized myself by keeping it in.”](https://www.compasshousingalliance.org/2025/11/i-penalized-myself-by-keeping-it-in/) bring the policy stakes down to the family and individual level, showing how trauma, health, and housing instability intersect.

### Food security, holiday giving, and community care

With a federal SNAP shutdown disrupting benefits, the City of Seattle moved quickly. Through [Coming Together to Support Students and Neighbors During the Government Shutdown](https://greenspace.seattle.gov/2025/11/coming-together-to-support-students-and-neighbors-during-the-government-shutdown/) and [More than $1 million in food assistance](https://humaninterests.seattle.gov/2025/11/26/more-than-1-million-in-food-assistance-reaches-seattle-food-banks-meal-programs-during-snap-disruption/), the city and Seattle Public Schools distributed 8,800 food boxes and funneled over $1 million to food banks and meal programs to meet a 21% spike in demand. United Way of King County’s [home grocery delivery](https://www.uwkc.org/breaking-the-cycle-of-poverty-news/meeting-our-neighbors-needs-with-home-grocery-delivery/) campaign shows how partnerships with Amazon and DoorDash are getting culturally relevant groceries to homebound residents.

On the ground, shelters and nonprofits are mobilizing holiday giving. Hospitality House’s [Holiday Help](https://hospitalityhousesouthking.org/holiday-help-heres-what-you-can-do/) invites residents to “adopt” a shelter guest or donate priority items, while Westside Neighbors Shelter’s Thanksgiving call in [It’s Thanksgiving! Got some time to help?](https://westsideneighborsshelter.org/its-thanksgiving-got-some-time-to-help/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=its-thanksgiving-got-some-time-to-help) seeks cooks and servers for a community meal. The Hunger Intervention Program’s profile [Getting to know Dave](https://hungerintervention.org/2025/11/26/getting-to-know-dave/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=getting-to-know-dave) and Transforming Age’s [Mission Matters: Thanksgiving 2025](https://transformingage.org/blog/mission-matters-thanksgiving-2025/) both underline how senior meal programs and grocery distributions are lifelines for older adults facing disability, rising costs, and isolation.
