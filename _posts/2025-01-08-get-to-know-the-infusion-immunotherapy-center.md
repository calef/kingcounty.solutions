  <p><br><strong>What is an infusion and immunotherapy center?</strong><br><em>An infusion center is an outpatient clinic that is certified to provide infusion therapy to patients. At our Infusion Center, we utilize advanced medical equipment and rely on a skilled team of healthcare professionals who specialize in administering a wide range of infusion treatments. Our primary goal is to offer patients a comfortable, safe, and efficient environment for receiving necessary treatments that can range from chemotherapy to hydration therapy.</em></p>



  <p><em>The new facility (in the East Pavilion) has been designed with one priority in mind: <strong>you, the patient</strong>. We believe that a comfortable and welcoming environment can play a significant role in the healing process. With updated, spacious treatment spaces, advanced equipment, and enhanced amenities, our new Center is a place where patients can receive the care they need with greater ease and dignity.</em></p>



  <p><strong>Who can be referred to the Infusion Center and what types of treatments are offered?</strong><br><em>Our Infusion Center provides services to patients who have been referred by a variety of specialists and clinics including (but not limited to) oncology, hematology, rheumatology, gynecology, cardiology, infectious disease, nephrology, neurology, and primary care. </em></p>



  <p><em>Treatments include:</em></p>



  <ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li><em>Chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and biotherapy: These treatments are commonly used to treat cancer, autoimmune disorders, and other conditions that require the modulation of the immune system.</em></li>



  <li><em>IV Antibiotics: administered to patients with infections that require more direct and potent treatment through intravenous delivery.</em></li>



  <li><em>Blood and platelet transfusions: Essential for patients with conditions such as blood disorders or anemia, or those undergoing treatments like chemotherapy that affect blood production.</em></li>



  <li><em>Plasmapheresis: A procedure to remove harmful substances from the blood, often used for autoimmune diseases and certain neurological conditions.</em></li>



  <li><em>Phlebotomy: The removal of blood for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes, often performed to manage iron overload or certain blood disorders.</em></li>



  <li><em>Hydration therapy: A treatment to replenish fluids and electrolytes, particularly for patients dealing with dehydration or undergoing treatments that cause fluid loss.</em></li>



  <li><em>Electrolyte replacements: Vital for patients who are experiencing an imbalance in their electrolytes due to illness, medication, or other medical conditions.</em></li>



  <li><em>Injections: Various medications are administered via injection to help manage conditions such as arthritis, infections, and chronic diseases.</em></li>
  </ul>



  <p><strong>How many staff work in the Infusion Center? Do they have special training?</strong><br><em>There are currently 46 team members in the Infusion Center and more are being hired for the new East Pavilion space. All nurses are required to have Chemotherapy/Immunotherapy certification as well as Oncology-Certified Nursing (ONC) certification).</em> </p>



  <p><strong>How do volunteers support the Infusion Center and its patients?</strong><br><em>Volunteers at the Infusion Center often serve as a source of emotional support, offering a listening ear, companionship, and comfort to patients during their treatment sessions. Infusion treatments, especially for conditions like cancer or chronic illness, can be long and exhausting, and having a volunteer available to talk to or simply provide companionship can significantly improve a patient’s emotional well-being. Volunteers may also assist with non-medical tasks, like helping patients get settled in, offering blankets or pillows, and providing light refreshments, ensuring that the patient’s experience is as comfortable as possible.</em></p>



  <p><strong>How will the new Cancer Center impact the patient experience at Valley?</strong><br><em>The new Cancer Center at Valley is set to transform the patient experience, offering a more integrated, comfortable, and compassionate approach to cancer care. With a focus on patient-centered care, and a dedicated, multidisciplinary team, the Cancer Center will have a profound impact on how patients experience their journey through diagnosis and treatment.</em></p>



  <p><strong>What is your favorite part of working in the infusion center?</strong><br><em>The patients and their families, and the very passionate/compassionate staff that serves the patients every day.&nbsp;We have an excellent team of people who are focused on providing exceptional care to our patients and families. </em></p>
