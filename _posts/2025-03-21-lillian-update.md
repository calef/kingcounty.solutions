  when I last gave an update on Lillian as she was entering middle school. We had
  wanted to say thank you to Boyer Children’s Clinic for a wonderful start to Lillian’s
  education during our year in Seattle. She was just 23 months when we started in
  Denise Swanson’s class with her assistant, Flora, and Judy Dittmer as speech therapist.
  Lillian took to school like a fish to water— and she hasn’t stopped since then.</p>\n<p>Middle
  school went by with a blur. It was tough at times for us, her parents, but Lillian
  transitioned from elementary school with the help of wonderful teachers. She learned
  to move around a much bigger school, passing through hallways from class to class,
  and learned to use a combination lock for a locker (though she forgot her combination
  over the winter holidays). She learned to eat lunch without an assigned seat and
  joined the after-school choir. She was awarded the very first Scarlett Neely Beacon
  of Light Award when she graduated 8th grade.</p>\n<p>She breezed into an even larger
  high school starting in 9th grade. I cried when I dropped her off the first day,
  feeling certain that she would get lost in the enormous building, and then parked
  my car and snuck in to watch her make contact with her new case manager who took
  her to her first class. She’s done great. It turns out that Lillian is very self-motivated,
  and really able to organize and follow through with assignments with very little
  assistance from us. Who knew that our most organized child would be the one with
  DS? She knows how to ask for help from the people who can help her. She loves learning
  and seems to retain and incorporate her bits of knowledge into her everyday life
  in a way unlike her sisters. Math has always been the hardest subject, but she works
  really hard to master the topics. When she struggled, we appealed to our rule that
  &#8216;anything we would do for one of our other children, we will do for Lillian&#8217;
  and found her wonderful tutors who took great interest in helping her succeed. She
  had always wanted to take Spanish since we had lived in Honduras when she was younger
  and her sister took the class. After two years of Lillian pleading her case, a plan
  was made to put her in a regular class but focusing mostly on conversation rather
  than grammar. Lillian was so thrilled. We knew it would be a stretch — and our school
  had never had a special needs student in a foreign language class — but she came
  home every day and studied on her own for several hours to keep up with the class.
  When the opportunity came up for her to use her study hall period to attend the
  same class lesson for a second time each day, she went every time so she could get
  a better grasp on the material. She took the same first year class for a second
  year — not batting an eye when we explained that it would help her get a better
  foundation — and she’s working just as hard this year as last. After two years of
  photography class (including darkroom work), our artistic girl joined the yearbook
  staff as a photographer. She has loved being a part of the staff and especially
  loves the late night sessions before deadlines.</p>\n<p>Outside of school, she continues
  to write song lyrics and fill journals with her life story. We wonder whether she
  will someday be able to write her autobiography, giving parents and other people
  with DS the chance to hear the unique perspective of person with Trisomy 21. She
  wants to be able to write the music to match her lyrics, so she takes piano and
  ukulele lessons with teachers who fully support her goal.</p>\n<p>Years ago, Boyer
  Children’s Clinic staff met with me to ask my goals for Lillian and what I wanted
  her to be able to do. When they explained that “everything” wasn’t specific enough,
  I said I wanted her to be able to read, swim, snow ski, and ride a bike. These were
  selfish hopes on my part, wanting to be able to do these things together as a family
  with our other kids— and she does all of them well now— and even got her scuba certification
  a year ago. She also plays games really well, which was a surprise after years of
  her being a &#8216;partner&#8217; to one of the other family members. She injured
  her knee (&#8216;kneecap, Mom&#8217; as Lillian corrects me) and had a major surgical
  reconstruction requiring months of therapy which she faced with courage and determination.
  She’s now back to doing everything. She’s in a class to help her pass the driver’s
  permit test which is a goal of hers. That’s been hard. She’s taken the test quite
  a few times, but is closer now to passing than ever. She also spends two weeks every
  summer at Camp Barnabas, an incredible camp for persons of all ages with special
  needs. While Lillian spends one week as a camper and another as a Role Model, the
  rest of her family have loved serving at the camp in different capacities as well
  as attending the camp as sibling campers.</p>\n<p>Lillian got a job at our local
  grocery store through a program meant for neurotypical kids, and did so well that
  she was hired as a regular employee. She just loves going to work, seeing her work
  family, and serving in our community. She likes it so much that she would probably
  do it for free. So many people know her in our small town, even if she doesn’t know
  them, and people always tell us how happy they are to see her at the store when
  they shop. She hopes to continue working there after college, though in a new capacity
  after she learns more about business and marketing.</p>\n<p>When her older sister
  started thinking about college, Lillian’s thoughts turned in the same direction.
  Even before we thought it was an option, Lillian was doing internet research about
  colleges that had special needs programs. She made lists of her favorite programs,
  and let us know where she was planning to go. She was so excited that we actually
  went to our first college visit when she was still a sophomore. My husband and I
  cried as the information session started; we had no idea that this was possible,
  and our girl was leading the way. In the end, we made a list of several programs
  within six hours of our town and visited even more of them before narrowing down
  the list. She worked hard on her applications and was accepted to four programs
  and is still waiting to hear from a fifth. She has decided to attend the Missouri
  State University Bear Power Program, which we think is the perfect distance from
  us at 129 miles away. It’s a five semester program where she will live in a dorm
  and take a few classes each semester while learning other valuable life skills and
  participating in job internships. She has the option of taking the classes as an
  audit or for credit that will transfer if she turns out to be able to pursue an
  associate’s or bachelor’s degree. She is so excited for next year. She just got
  her meningitis B vaccine in preparation for dorm life.</p>\n<p>One of her teachers
  pointed out that Lillian has &#8216;peaked&#8217; at just the right time to head
  to college this fall, not too early and not too late. We are thankful for Boyer
  Children’s Clinic where Lillian began her school career in 2007, for the teachers
  who pushed and encouraged her even at 23 months, and for the wonderful program which
  gave us a taste of what special education could do. Keep up the great work. You

With aspirations for college, she has researched special needs programs and is set to attend the Missouri State University Bear Power Program, which offers life skills and internships.
