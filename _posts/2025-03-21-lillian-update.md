Lillian, now entering high school, has made remarkable progress since her early days at Boyer Children’s Clinic. Transitioning from middle school was challenging yet successful, aided by supportive teachers. Lillian has developed independence, managing her assignments and seeking help when needed. She has a passion for learning, particularly in Spanish, and has excelled in her studies despite math being a tough subject. Lillian has also embraced extracurricular activities, joining the yearbook staff and continuing to explore her artistic side through photography.

Outside of academics, she writes song lyrics and aspires to compose music, taking lessons in piano and ukulele. Lillian has achieved personal milestones, including learning to swim, snow ski, and ride a bike, and even earning her scuba certification. After overcoming a significant knee injury, she is now focused on passing her driver's permit test. 

Lillian has secured a job at a local grocery store, showcasing her strong work ethic and community engagement. With aspirations for college, she has researched special needs programs and is set to attend the Missouri State University Bear Power Program, which offers life skills and internships. Her family expresses gratitude for the support they've received throughout her journey.
