  The Sophia Way began with a small group of compassionate individuals who saw a need and took action. Their commitment built more than programs – they created a place of hope and change for women experiencing homelessness. Many of those early volunteers are still with us today, continuing to walk alongside the women we serve. We honor their dedication and the many who have since joined this journey.

  We know we ask a lot of you, and yet, you continue to show up. As our mission becomes more urgent, we feel the momentum of this incredible community in action. From the thoughtful meals lovingly prepared, to the donation drives you host, the hours spent organizing items, supporting staff during mealtimes, and showing up for women every day – you are creating lasting change.

  Your compassion helps us meet the growing needs of women seeking shelter and stability – needs that are the result of trauma and hardship. Your dedication makes our shelters not just places of safety, but spaces of healing and renewal. It takes a community, and we are deeply grateful you are part of The Sophia Way. Together, we are building a future filled with hope and possibility.

  We look forward to celebrating you – our incredible volunteers – at a special event this July. Stay tuned for more details.

  **Celebrating Our Wednesday Volunteers**

  Every Wednesday from 12 to 2 pm, something special happens at The Sophia Way’s Donation Center. A dedicated group of volunteers – many of whom started during the pandemic – gather not just to sort donated clothing, toiletries, linens, and more, but to share laughter, friendship, and purpose. They are the heartbeat of our in-kind donation program, generously supported by a giving community.

  The volunteers come out of love. As Cory says,&nbsp;_“You come here because you want to be a part of a community.”_

  Led by Megan Duncan, our Engagement Manager, this team has turned Wednesdays into a weekly ritual of connection and care.&nbsp;_“The donation center is a hub,”_&nbsp;MD says.&nbsp;_“Volunteers work tremendously hard to ensure the women we serve have what they need.”_

  _“It’s something I look forward to,”&nbsp;_shares Liza.&nbsp;_“You’re helping women in our community and meeting great people.”&nbsp;_Adds Marcus,_&nbsp;“We’re all doing something that helps people&nbsp; – that’s the nice part.”&nbsp;_Christine reflects_, “I retired and found something meaningful. We work hard, but it’s fun. I keep coming back because of the people.”_

  Some days there’s even a sweet bonus – homemade cookies from Sue.

  Thank you to our Wednesday volunteers for making a big difference in just a few short hours.
