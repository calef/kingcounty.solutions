BrightSpark has released its FY24/25 Community Impact Report, highlighting the organization's significant efforts in enhancing access to and the quality of child care. The report celebrates the collaboration among families, providers, and partners in creating child-centered, antiracist systems of care. In a year marked by expansion and refinement of services, BrightSpark focused on two main goals: increasing access to early learning and improving child care quality in King and Pierce Counties. Key achievements include connecting thousands of families to child care, distributing over $15 million in subsidies, and supporting nearly 2,400 child care providers through various programs. The report emphasizes the importance of community support in reshaping early learning and expresses gratitude for the collective dedication of all stakeholders involved. BrightSpark is committed to continuing this impactful work in the coming year.
