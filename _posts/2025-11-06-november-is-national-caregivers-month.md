November is a month dedicated to recognizing and supporting family caregivers, who provide essential assistance to older adults and individuals with disabilities in the U.S. According to the National Council on Aging (NCOA), while caregiving can be rewarding, it often imposes significant emotional, physical, and financial burdens on family members, who must balance these responsibilities with their own lives. Many individuals will either care for aging relatives or may require assistance themselves in the future. Strengthening family and community relationships is vital, as they provide joy, meaning, and comfort. During this month, it's important to acknowledge and honor family caregivers by reaching out to them, as thoughtful gestures can provide much-needed support. Various organizations, including the NCOA, Caregiver Action Network, National Alliance for Caregiving, and Share The Care, offer resources and ideas for celebrating family caregiving and supporting those who dedicate their time to caring for loved ones.
