The Sophia Way, a non-profit organization that supports and empowers homeless women, celebrates Women's History Month by honoring extraordinary women who have been part of its journey. Founded by Helen Leuzzi, the organization has grown from a small non-profit into a vital resource that serves hundreds of women daily, guiding them towards stability and independent living. The Sophia Way's work extends beyond providing shelter, it builds a community of care, compassion, and support. The organization's impact goes beyond the women it directly serves, thanks to donors and supporters who fuel its mission.
