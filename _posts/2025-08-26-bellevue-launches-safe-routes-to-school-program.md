The City of Bellevue has launched the Safe Routes to School program to enhance safety and convenience for students walking, biking, or rolling to school. This initiative is part of a national effort and will involve funding for street improvements near schools, increased traffic safety education, and community events. The City Council has allocated funds in the 2025-26 budget specifically for traffic safety and engagement in schools, aligning with the city's active transportation and environmental sustainability goals.

As the Bellevue School District and nearby districts prepare to start classes on September 2, the program aims to create a safe, sustainable transportation environment for all families. It focuses on improving travel experiences for students through innovative programming, infrastructure upgrades, and community collaboration while addressing safety concerns and promoting active transportation habits.

To ensure safe travel for children, the community is reminded to adhere to traffic laws, stop for school buses with flashing lights, and follow parking regulations during drop-off and pick-up. Residents are encouraged to consider alternative routes to reduce congestion around schools during peak times. Additional resources for safe travel near schools are also available.
