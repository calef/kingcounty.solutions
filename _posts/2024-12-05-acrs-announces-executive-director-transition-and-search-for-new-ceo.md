title: ACRS Announces Executive Director Transition and Search for New CEO
topics: []
---

ACRS has announced that Executive Director Michael Byun will be transitioning from his role, with the search for a new Chief Executive Officer (CEO) commencing in December 2024. Byun has led ACRS for nearly seven years, navigating significant milestones including the organization’s 50th anniversary and challenges like the global pandemic and racial justice movements. He expressed pride in the resilience of ACRS and its community, emphasizing the importance of collaborative efforts in facing potential threats to the communities served.

Byun will remain in his position until a new CEO is appointed, expected by summer or fall of 2025, to ensure a smooth leadership transition. The ACRS Board of Directors expressed deep gratitude for Byun’s commitment to the organization and its mission of supporting Asian, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander, and other underserved communities.

A search committee has been established to identify the next CEO, gathering input from the community and ACRS staff on the desired qualities for the new leader. ACRS aims to find a candidate who embodies its core values of social justice, community, and service, and who can continue to build on Byun’s legacy. A public announcement regarding the new CEO will follow the completion of the search process.
