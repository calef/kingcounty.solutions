This year's Power of Home celebration achieved remarkable success, raising over $100,000 to support resident services and enhancing the Pack the Pantry initiative for families and seniors in Mercy Housing communities. The event featured four young residents as DJs, showcasing their skills from a partnership with Scratch Out Loud, which highlighted the potential of youth when given support. Honorees Jonathan and Selena, both dedicated team members with a decade of service, were celebrated for their impactful contributions to the community and the organization. The atmosphere was filled with joy and excitement, reinforcing a collective commitment to providing stable, affordable housing. The funds raised will ensure a reliable supply of essential food items for those in need, making a significant difference as the organization approaches the Giving Season. The Power of Home event served as a reminder of the importance of community and collaboration in creating a supportive environment for thousands across Georgia.
