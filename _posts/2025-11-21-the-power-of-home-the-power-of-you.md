  <p>This year’s <em>Power of Home</em> celebration was our most successful yet, and it’s all because of you! Together, we had an evening filled with joy, community, and a renewed commitment to ensuring everyone has a stable, affordable place to call home. We raised more than $100,000 to support resident services as we packed the Pantry.</p>
  <p>From the moment guests arrived, the energy was electric. Four young residents opened the night as our featured DJs, showcasing the skills they’ve gained through months of hands-on learning in partnership with Scratch Out Loud.  Their performance set the perfect tone and reminded everyone of the creativity, confidence, and leadership that grow when young people are supported.</p>
  <p>A special moment came when we honored Jonathan and Selena, two MHSE team members who have each dedicated 10 years to this mission. Their decade of service represents thousands of hours supporting residents, building community, and strengthening the fabric of our organization. Jonathan and Selena’s commitment reflects the heart of MHSE: steady, compassionate, and deeply rooted in community.</p>

  <p>Whether you joined us in person or supported from afar, we’re grateful. Events like this remind us that when we gather with purpose, we make home possible for thousands across Georgia.</p>
