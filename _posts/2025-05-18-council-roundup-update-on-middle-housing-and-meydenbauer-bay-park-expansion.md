The Bellevue City Council held a meeting on May 18, 2025, discussing proposed land use code amendments aimed at supporting middle housing development in compliance with recent state legislation. Washington's House Bills 1110 and 1337 mandate that cities increase housing types and density in residential zones to enhance affordability and supply. Bellevue's amendments will allow a minimum number of units per lot, six types of middle housing, and two accessory dwelling units (ADUs) per lot. The council will continue discussions on these proposals in future sessions.

In addition, the council reviewed plans for the Meydenbauer Gateway and Promenade expansion, which aims to connect Meydenbauer Bay Park with downtown. This project includes a plaza at Main Street and a safe walkway to the beach. Following community input, the second phase of the park expansion is expected to begin construction in 2029.

The council also approved the city’s federal legislative agenda for 2025-26, focusing on transportation, infrastructure, and housing. Additionally, proclamations were made for Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month, Older Americans Month, and Building Safety Month.
