  Foster Golf Links centennial celebration continues!

  Join us for the all-time movie classic&nbsp;[Happy Gilmore](https://youtu.be/y1emDAYCfVQ?si=E-z-tX8AtLLVQJ-J)&nbsp;on the outdoor big screen.

  Happy had his trusty hockey stick for putting – what would&nbsp;you&nbsp;use to drive a ball off the tee? For some added fun, join our&nbsp;ANYTHING BUT A DRIVER&nbsp;competition, which will kick off this&nbsp;FREE&nbsp;event at 7:45 p.m. Winning categories include:

  - Furthest Distance Drive
  - Most Creative ‘Driver’
  - People’s Choice

  The movie will follow, starting at approximately 9 p.m. The course restaurant, Billy Baroo’s, will be open until 10 p.m. for your refreshment needs.

  If some golfing action is more your style, join us for a round of&nbsp;Glow Ball!

  The night’s fun starts with a Shotgun Start at 8:45 p.m. – all teams start simultaneously but at different holes on the course!

  Other event details:

  - Two-person teams
  - Alternate shot format
  - $60 per person fee (includes 9 holes, glow balls, glow swag, and a $10 Billy Baroo’s gift card).
