At the Paths to Possibility Gala in San Francisco, Juma raised over $265,000 to enhance its YouthConnect model, which aims to provide work and opportunity for young people. The event featured inspiring speeches, including a keynote from NBA champion Festus Ezeli and testimonials from Juma leaders and youth. Funds raised will support the expansion of the Connect program, focusing on helping youth develop individualized plans for their careers. This includes one-on-one coaching, personalized goal planning, and hands-on training experiences such as job shadowing and internships. Additionally, resources will be allocated to remove barriers that hinder youth, such as transportation costs and the need for professional attire, ensuring they can successfully transition into stable careers. The gala celebrated the achievements of Juma youth and the supporters who contribute to empowering the next generation.
