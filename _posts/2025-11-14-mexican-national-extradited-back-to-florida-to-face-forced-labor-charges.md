Alexander Villatoro Moreno, a 53-year-old Mexican national, was extradited to Florida from Mexico to face multiple charges, including conspiracy to violate the RICO Act and forced labor. His indictment details fraudulent recruitment of Mexican workers under H-2A visas for agricultural work from September 2015 to December 2017. Moreno and his co-defendants misled victims about pay, working conditions, and reimbursement for fees. Once in the U.S., they compelled labor through intimidation, including confiscating passports and threatening harm to family members in Mexico.

Moreno's co-defendants have already pleaded guilty, with sentences ranging from home detention to over nine years in prison. The case was investigated by the Palm Beach County Human Trafficking Task Force, which includes various federal and local agencies, with significant assistance from Mexican authorities for the extradition process. If convicted, Moreno faces a maximum of 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. The Justice Department emphasizes that an indictment is merely an allegation, and Moreno is presumed innocent until proven guilty in court.
