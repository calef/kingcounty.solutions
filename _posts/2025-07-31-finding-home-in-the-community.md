Mukesh and Ambica, Indian Gujaratis, lived in Mombasa, Kenya, before moving to England in 1967 due to discrimination following Kenya's independence. After facing cultural shocks in England, they moved to the U.S. in 1985. Despite finding success in their Dairy Queen franchise in Wenatchee, they felt a lack of belonging, especially after retiring and being far from their children.

The IACS senior programs, which include yoga, tai chi, and shared lunches, provide familiarity and friendship for immigrants like Mukesh and Ambica.
