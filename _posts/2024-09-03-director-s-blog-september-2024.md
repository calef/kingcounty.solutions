  It is hard to believe that it’s September already. But in addition to gearing up to help students, teachers and parents prepare for a new school year, KCLS has many ways to celebrate the remaining days of summer.

  This month’s wide-ranging opportunities include a library anniversary party, some very special author talks, and events honoring Welcoming Week and National Hispanic Heritage Month. You can attend an amazing opera recital, join an outdoor StoryWalk, and attend some election information programs.

  September is also National Library Card Month. Your KCLS card allows you to explore a world of knowledge, resources and entertainment. For those patrons who racked up reading minutes for the 1 Million Reads Challenge launched earlier this year, I’m happy to report that patron success in meeting that goal has led us to move the goal posts. Keep tracking your minutes to reach KCLS’ new [3 Million Reads Challenge](https://kcls.org/news/take-our-reading-challenge-3-million-reads/), which runs through December 31.

  Our impressive September program lineup begins September 6 with the [Issaquah Culture Fest](https://kcls.bibliocommons.com/events/66ba48331be1968097df918e), the first of several events celebrating [Welcoming Week](https://kcls.org/welcoming-week/), which runs September 13-22. &nbsp;Welcoming Week is a national campaign inspiring the everyday work of building multicultural communities of belonging.&nbsp; The Issaquah event features world dances, food trucks, art and other activities.

  On September 13, Redmond Library is partnering with the City of Redmond to bring the community together with an [“adventure lab”](https://kcls.bibliocommons.com/events/66b23458aefc8df4a11a2cbd) party, including a geocaching event and scavenger hunt. You can learn more about the library and its neighbor, the City of Redmond’s municipal campus.

  KCLS is partnering with the City of SeaTac September 14 to host a [Welcoming Week event](https://kcls.bibliocommons.com/events/66b23458aefc8df4a11a2cbd) to celebrate community diversity, with a resource fair, food from different cultures and live entertainment.

  Other programs abound. On September 12, KCLS is honored to host former White House speechwriter **Terry Szuplat** , who will give an [online discussion](https://kcls.bibliocommons.com/events/66cdf5056023b72f00be03f3) of his new book, **_Say It Well_**. The book, scheduled for publication September 17, reveals not only lessons learned while writing speeches for former President Barak Obama, but a compelling account of finding his own voice as a public speaker.

  That same night, a later online event features [Sabrina Strings](https://kcls.bibliocommons.com/events/667af1c590b60b330047386a), author of **_Fearing the Black Body: The Racial Origins of Fat Phobia_**** &nbsp; **and&nbsp;** _The End of Love: Racism, Sexism and the Death of Romance._** Both events are part of our [Author Voices](https://kcls.bibliocommons.com/v2/events?_gl=1*c0srag*_ga*MTQzOTc1NDUzMi4xNzI0MzQ3NTIy*_ga_G99DMMNG39*MTcyNDk1NjAyMi4xMy4xLjE3MjQ5NTY1OTQuMC4wLjA.*_ga_87TS29R5HD*MTcyNDk1NjAyMi4xMy4xLjE3MjQ5NTY5ODMuMC4wLjA.*_ga_GSN8Q2NL99*MTcyNDk1NjAyMi4xMy4xLjE3MjQ5NTY5ODIuMC4wLjA.*_ga_VP05GNK0XC*MTcyNDk1NjAyMi4xMy4xLjE3MjQ5NTY5ODIuMC4wLjA.*_ga_QXTYXDVVNT*MTcyNDk1NjAyMi4xMy4xLjE3MjQ5NTY5ODIuMC4wLjA.&q=author%20voices) series.

  That series includes featured authors for [National Hispanic and Latinx Heritage Month](https://kcls.org/celebrate-national-hispanic-and-latinx-heritage-month/), which runs September 15 to October 15. Check our website for staff-recommended books, activities and other inspiration.

  Saturday September 14 is a day also packed with various opportunities. You can visit North Bend Library for its [30th Anniversary party](https://kcls.bibliocommons.com/events/66ba668238e458ba8c1d6665), or head to Federal Way Library for an opera event called [Recital: Black Excellence in Music](https://kcls.bibliocommons.com/events/66b2a2cb897288371b2c1ee8)<u>.</u> The latter is a partnership between KCLS, Seattle Opera and 5th Avenue Theater.

  Also on September 14, a [StoryWalk celebration](https://kcls.bibliocommons.com/events/66c4cdbab73f992800059d1a) will be held at Sunset Neighborhood Park next to the Renton Highlands Library. The event features **_The Wild_**  **by Yuval Zommer** , a story about how all people can work together to protect the earth.

  Head to MacFarland Park in Enumclaw for another [Story Walk](https://kcls.bibliocommons.com/events/66bd194eb73f99280004c063?_gl=1*16c8qw5*_ga*MzIyNjUxMzgxLjE2OTAyMjAzNTU.*_ga_G99DMMNG39*MTcyNDY5NjU1Mi4yMTkuMS4xNzI0Njk2NjY2LjAuMC4w*_ga_87TS29R5HD*MTcyNDY5NjU1My4yMzAuMS4xNzI0Njk2NTk1LjAuMC4w*_ga_GSN8Q2NL99*MTcyNDY5NjU5NS4yMTYuMC4xNzI0Njk2NTk1LjAuMC4w*_ga_VP05GNK0XC*MTcyNDY5NjU5NS4yMTYuMC4xNzI0Njk2NTk1LjAuMC4w*_ga_QXTYXDVVNT*MTcyNDY5NjU5NS4yMTYuMC4xNzI0Njk2NTk1LjAuMC4w). You can walk park paths while reading **_We Are Water Protectors_**** _&nbsp;_ ****by Carole Lindstrom** through September 12.

  Public libraries have always been sources of trustworthy, impartial information to patrons so they can learn and make their own choices and decisions. With the important general election coming up November 5, KCLS is offering programs to this month and next to increase voter awareness and education. Please check our [website](https://kcls.bibliocommons.com/v2/events?q=Voter%20Registration%20Day) for various event dates and times.

  There are so many ways to enjoy September with KCLS. Join us!
