Youth Eastside Services (YES) is expanding its integrated school-based behavioral health program to four schools in the Issaquah School District this fall. This initiative follows an invitation from Noah Westerberg, the district's Director of Counseling and Student Support Services, who previously worked with YES in the Lake Washington School District. YES employs a multi-tiered approach to mental health support, offering prevention education, group interventions, and individual therapy for students in crisis. The program embeds behavioral health specialists in schools to foster a supportive environment, collaborating with teachers and families to build a culture of mental wellness.

This expansion will provide dedicated behavioral health specialists and part-time supervisors at Skyline, Issaquah, and Liberty high schools, as well as Issaquah Middle School. The initiative is funded by the school district and community donations, reflecting a commitment to student mental health. As students face various challenges, including anxiety and trauma, this new support aims to ensure that help is readily available. YES seeks further community support to enhance these services and reach more students in the future.
