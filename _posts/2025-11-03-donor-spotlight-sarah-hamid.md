Sarah Hamid's journey with Youth Eastside Services (YES) began as a mother seeking support for her son during the pandemic's emotional challenges. Initially, her son attended counseling, but Sarah recognized that he needed connection more than therapy. This realization led them to the SUCCESS Mentoring Program at YES, where her son was paired with a mentor, fostering a meaningful relationship. Inspired by this positive change, Sarah decided to give back to the community. She hosted a table at the Invest in Youth Breakfast, which highlighted impactful stories and experiences from YES, reinforcing her commitment to youth mental health. With a background in community service and nonprofit leadership, Sarah is passionate about addressing loneliness and mental health issues among young people. She advocates for "social prescribing," a concept that connects individuals to community resources that promote belonging and purpose. Sarah believes that healing often starts with connection and that one caring adult can significantly influence a young person's life. She encourages others to support youth and families through donations to YES, emphasizing that every contribution, regardless of size, makes a meaningful difference in the community.
