  <h2><strong>Donor Spotlight: Sarah Hamid &#8211; Following Her Heart</strong></h2>
  <p>When Sarah Hamid first came to Youth Eastside Services (YES), she was a mother seeking support and understanding for her son. Like many families during the pandemic, hers was navigating new emotional terrain, isolation, stress, and uncertainty that touched most young people during that difficult time.</p>
  <h3>Discovering the Power of Connection</h3>
  <p>At first, her son began counseling at YES, where he connected with a compassionate counseling intern. The experience was positive, but after some time, Sarah realized what her son needed most wasn’t more therapy sessions, but connection.</p>
  <p>That’s when they were introduced to Jake Marsh, who leads the <span style="color: #ff6600;"><a style="color: #ff6600;" href="https://www.youtheastsideservices.org/get-involved/success-mentoring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SUCCESS Mentoring Program</a></span> at YES. Through the program, Sarah’s son was paired with a mentor, and they clicked right away.</p>
  <blockquote><p>“We were connected with a wonderful, wonderful mentor for my son,” Sarah shared. “Many times, kids or young adults actually need connection more than they need counseling. At least that’s what I found in my son’s situation.”</p></blockquote>
  <p>That simple, meaningful connection sparked something in Sarah too, a desire to give back.</p>
  <h3>A Moment That Sparked Something Bigger</h3>
  <p>Earlier this year, she hosted a table at the <span style="color: #ff6600;"><a style="color: #ff6600;" href="https://youtheastsideservices.org/investinyouth" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Invest in Youth Breakfast</a></span>, inviting friends and colleagues to see firsthand the stories of courage and hope that define YES. The experience left a lasting impression.</p>
  <blockquote><p>“We had great speakers and stories from people with lived experience,” she said. “It was very impactful, and that’s needed in this community.”</p></blockquote>
  <p>For Sarah, the experience was both inspiring and grounding. In tandem with her corporate legal career, she’s finding herself drawn more deeply to mental health work, especially for youth.</p>
  <blockquote><p>“There are these pockets of time in life when we can pause and really pay attention. To match what our community needs with what we have to give. I’ve found myself drawn to what’s happening with our young people, with mental health, and with the loneliness epidemic.”</p></blockquote>
  <p>Her perspective comes from a lifetime of community service. Sarah has served on several nonprofit boards, most recently the <span style="color: #ff6600;"><a style="color: #ff6600;" href="https://www.supportsfd.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seattle Firefighter Foundation</a></span>, where she helped raise awareness of the emotional toll first responders face. Whether addressing public safety or youth mental health, Sarah is guided by one principle: get to the root cause.</p>
  <h3>Healing Through Belonging</h3>
  <p>She’s particularly motivated by the concept of<span style="color: #ff6600;"> <a style="color: #ff6600;" href="https://www.socialprescribingusa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social prescribing</a></span>, a growing movement in the UK that connects people to activities, community groups, and resources that nurture belonging and purpose. It’s an approach that mirrors the mentorship and holistic care Sarah and her son discovered at YES.</p>
  <blockquote><p>“Sometimes it’s not about heavy-duty counseling,” Sarah said. “It might just be having someone to talk to, a mentor, or being part of a larger social group. Many times, it’s that connectedness that somebody needs.”</p></blockquote>
  <p>At YES, we’re deeply grateful for Sarah, for her heart, her advocacy, and her belief that every young person deserves a strong start and a community that sees them. Her story reminds us that healing often begins with connection, and that one caring adult can change a young person’s life just as one inspired parent can change a community.</p>

  ## **Donor Spotlight: Sarah Hamid – Following Her Heart**

  When Sarah Hamid first came to Youth Eastside Services (YES), she was a mother seeking support and understanding for her son. Like many families during the pandemic, hers was navigating new emotional terrain, isolation, stress, and uncertainty that touched most young people during that difficult time.

  ### Discovering the Power of Connection

  At first, her son began counseling at YES, where he connected with a compassionate counseling intern. The experience was positive, but after some time, Sarah realized what her son needed most wasn’t more therapy sessions, but connection.

  That’s when they were introduced to Jake Marsh, who leads the [SUCCESS Mentoring Program](https://www.youtheastsideservices.org/get-involved/success-mentoring/) at YES. Through the program, Sarah’s son was paired with a mentor, and they clicked right away.

  > “We were connected with a wonderful, wonderful mentor for my son,” Sarah shared. “Many times, kids or young adults actually need connection more than they need counseling. At least that’s what I found in my son’s situation.”

  That simple, meaningful connection sparked something in Sarah too, a desire to give back.

  ### A Moment That Sparked Something Bigger

  Earlier this year, she hosted a table at the [Invest in Youth Breakfast](https://youtheastsideservices.org/investinyouth), inviting friends and colleagues to see firsthand the stories of courage and hope that define YES. The experience left a lasting impression.

Sarah Hamid's journey with Youth Eastside Services (YES) began as a mother seeking support for her son during the pandemic's emotional challenges. Initially, her son attended counseling, but Sarah recognized that he needed connection more than therapy. This realization led them to the SUCCESS Mentoring Program at YES, where her son was paired with a mentor, fostering a meaningful relationship. Inspired by this positive change, Sarah decided to give back to the community. She hosted a table at the Invest in Youth Breakfast, which highlighted impactful stories and experiences from YES, reinforcing her commitment to youth mental health. With a background in community service and nonprofit leadership, Sarah is passionate about addressing loneliness and mental health issues among young people. She advocates for "social prescribing," a concept that connects individuals to community resources that promote belonging and purpose. Sarah believes that healing often starts with connection and that one caring adult can significantly influence a young person's life. She encourages others to support youth and families through donations to YES, emphasizing that every contribution, regardless of size, makes a meaningful difference in the community.
