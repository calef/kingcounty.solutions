Sacha's House is a family refuge in Washington, specifically designed for youth aged 12-17 who are experiencing homelessness. Operated by Lighthouse, Sacha's House provides a safe, nurturing environment where young people can access essential services and support. The program focuses on helping youth achieve stability and independence by offering various resources, including counseling, education support, and life skills training. 

The house accommodates up to six residents at a time, allowing for personalized attention and care. Staff members are dedicated to creating a welcoming atmosphere that fosters trust and respect. In addition to immediate housing, the program emphasizes long-term solutions by assisting residents in developing goals and plans for their futures. 

Sacha's House also collaborates with local organizations to ensure that youth receive comprehensive support, including healthcare and employment opportunities. The initiative aims to empower young individuals, helping them transition from homelessness to self-sufficiency. By addressing both immediate needs and future aspirations, Sacha's House plays a crucial role in transforming the lives of vulnerable youth in the community.
