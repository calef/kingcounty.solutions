  Dozens of jurisdictions join suit against federal housing and transportation agencies

  The City of Bellevue and 26 other cities, counties, and agencies joined as plaintiffs in July in an existing lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Department of Transportation (DOT). By joining the suit, referred to as King County et al. v. Turner et al., Bellevue seeks to retain access and eligibility for approximately $65 million in federal fund awards, to which the federal government recently added, or intends to add, certain new conditions.

  The lawsuit alleges these conditions are unconstitutional as the executive branch does not have authority to change grant conditions without congressional approval. In addition, the conditions are unrelated to the work done through the grants and may force cities like Bellevue to make legal promises that conflict with state and local laws and city values of supporting all community members. The conditions relate to immigration enforcement, diversity, equity and inclusion, and gender.&nbsp;

  Bellevue uses HUD grants for critical human services needs and DOT grants for transportation projects supporting pedestrian accessibility and safety, as well as local and regional trails and bridges. Bellevue, like all the plaintiffs, seeks to retain eligibility for these grant funds without having to agree to the unlawful conditions that also conflict with its commitment to the community.

  “These grants support critical work in Bellevue in alignment with our longstanding values of inclusion and community support,” said Bellevue City Manager Diane Carlson. “Our hope in joining this lawsuit is to ensure Bellevue retains the opportunity to receive these federal funds so we can continue doing important work for our community.”

  The amended complaint adding Bellevue as a plaintiff was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington.

The City of Bellevue has joined a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Department of Transportation (DOT) alongside 26 other jurisdictions. The suit, known as King County et al. v. Turner et al., aims to secure access to approximately $65 million in federal funds amid new conditions imposed by the federal government. These conditions are claimed to be unconstitutional, as they allegedly require congressional approval for changes to grant terms. The conditions also reportedly conflict with state and local laws and the city’s values, particularly regarding immigration enforcement, diversity, equity, inclusion, and gender. Bellevue utilizes HUD grants for essential human services and DOT grants for transportation projects that enhance pedestrian safety and support local infrastructure. Bellevue City Manager Diane Carlson emphasized the importance of these grants in aligning with the city’s commitment to community support and inclusion. The complaint was formally submitted to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington.
