The City of Bellevue has joined a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Department of Transportation (DOT) alongside 26 other jurisdictions. The suit, known as King County et al. v. Turner et al., aims to secure access to approximately $65 million in federal funds amid new conditions imposed by the federal government. These conditions are claimed to be unconstitutional, as they allegedly require congressional approval for changes to grant terms. The conditions also reportedly conflict with state and local laws and the city’s values, particularly regarding immigration enforcement, diversity, equity, inclusion, and gender. Bellevue utilizes HUD grants for essential human services and DOT grants for transportation projects that enhance pedestrian safety and support local infrastructure. Bellevue City Manager Diane Carlson emphasized the importance of these grants in aligning with the city’s commitment to community support and inclusion. The complaint was formally submitted to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington.
