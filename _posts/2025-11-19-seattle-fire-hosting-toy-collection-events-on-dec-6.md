Seattle Fire Department is partnering with the U.S. Marine Corps for the annual Toys for Tots drive on December 6, 2025. Toy collection will take place from 2 to 4 p.m. at four fire stations: Greenwood (Fire Station 21), West Seattle (Fire Station 29), Hawthorne Hills (Fire Station 38), and Magnolia (Fire Station 41), where donations will be accepted until 5 p.m. in Magnolia during Winterfest. Firefighters will collect new, unwrapped gifts, including games, puzzles, toys, make-up kits, sports equipment, books, and art supplies. The department encourages donors to consider gifts for infants and teens, as these groups are often overlooked. The collected toys will be distributed by the Marine Corps to local organizations serving children and families in the Seattle/King County area. After the event, no additional items can be accepted, but other contribution options include checking for additional drop-off locations until December 10, 2025, making online donations, or donating items at local food banks. The Seattle Fire Department expresses gratitude for community support during the holiday season, aiming to create lasting memories for those in need.
