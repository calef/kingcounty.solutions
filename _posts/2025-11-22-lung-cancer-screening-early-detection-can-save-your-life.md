Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related deaths, but early detection through screening can significantly improve survival rates. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends annual low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scans for individuals aged 50 to 80 with a history of heavy smoking. This screening can detect lung cancer in its early stages when treatment is more effective. Veterans are particularly encouraged to participate in these screenings due to their higher risk factors. The Veterans Health Administration offers free lung cancer screenings at various facilities, emphasizing the importance of getting screened. Patients are urged to consult their healthcare providers to determine their eligibility for LDCT scans. Recognizing symptoms such as persistent cough, chest pain, and unexplained weight loss is crucial, as these may indicate lung cancer. Early diagnosis can lead to timely intervention and improved outcomes, making awareness and participation in screening programs vital for at-risk populations.
