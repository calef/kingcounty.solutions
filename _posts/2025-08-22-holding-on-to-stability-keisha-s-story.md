original_content: "<p class=\"\">For Keisha, a single mom of three, stability meant
  everything—especially for her oldest child, who has autism and thrives on routine.
  After years of effort, Keisha had finally built a steady life for her family. They’d
  faced challenging times before, even experiencing homelessness together, but things
  were finally stable and looking up for the young family. Then Keisha’s childcare
  fell through. Without it, she lost her job, and bills quickly piled up.&nbsp;</p><p
  class=\"\">The fear of losing her home was devastating. Keisha worried about uprooting
  her children and undoing all the progress she had worked so hard for.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
