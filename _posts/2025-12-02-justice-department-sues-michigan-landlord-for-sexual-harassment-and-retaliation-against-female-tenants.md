The Justice Department has filed a lawsuit against a Michigan landlord for alleged sexual harassment and retaliation against female tenants. The lawsuit claims that the landlord engaged in a pattern of misconduct, including making unwanted sexual advances, groping, and threatening eviction if tenants did not comply with his demands. The suit also alleges that the landlord retaliated against women who reported his behavior by raising their rent and attempting to evict them. This action is part of a broader initiative by the Justice Department to combat sexual harassment in housing. The department seeks damages for the victims and aims to hold the landlord accountable for his actions. The lawsuit underscores the importance of protecting tenants' rights and ensuring a safe living environment free from harassment and intimidation.
