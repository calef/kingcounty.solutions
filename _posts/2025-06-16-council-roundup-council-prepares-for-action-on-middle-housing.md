The Bellevue City Council discussed proposed code changes to align housing policies with new state middle housing legislation during a meeting on June 10, 2025. This follows the Washington State Legislature's 2023 passage of House Bills 1110 and 1337, which mandate cities to allow more housing types and increased density in residential areas to enhance affordability and supply. Bellevue must adopt these code changes by June 30. The council reviewed land use code amendments recommended by the Planning Commission that support citywide middle housing development. After discussing the state’s minimum requirements versus the Planning Commission’s suggestions, council members provided direction for the final ordinance to incorporate these changes, with final action expected in a future meeting.

Additionally, the council approved new appointments to the Human Services, Planning, and Transportation commissions, where volunteers contribute to policy recommendations. The council also proclaimed June 15 as World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, recognizing the serious issues affecting the health and rights of older adults, as established by the United Nations General Assembly in 2011.
