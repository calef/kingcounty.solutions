Dando Voz (Giving Voice) is a program dedicated to supporting Latinx survivors through a variety of services, including a support line, advocacy, and therapy. Staffed by bilingual and bicultural providers, the program aims to empower survivors and their families with essential resources for healing. In celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month, team members shared their personal motivations for their work. 

Alejandra, a bilingual legal advocate, emphasized the importance of ensuring that victims feel believed and supported within a justice system that often overlooks their needs. Agustina, the director of clinical services, expressed her honor in accompanying survivors and witnessing their resilience. Berenice, another bilingual legal advocate, highlighted the necessity of providing access to crucial information during challenging times. Raquel, also a bilingual legal advocate, shared her commitment to standing by survivors during their toughest moments, believing in their strength and right to heal without shame. Each staff member's "porqué" reflects a deep dedication to serving and uplifting the community they work with.
