title: Justice Department Sues Six Additional States for Failure to Provide Voter
  Registration Rolls
topics: []
---

The Justice Department has filed a lawsuit against six states, including Florida, Georgia, and Iowa, for failing to comply with federal voter registration laws by not providing accurate voter registration rolls. The states are accused of violating the National Voter Registration Act, which mandates that they maintain and update their voter registration systems. The lawsuits aim to ensure that these states fulfill their obligations to provide complete and accurate voter registration information, which is crucial for the integrity of the electoral process. The Justice Department emphasizes the importance of maintaining valid voter rolls to prevent issues such as voter fraud and to uphold the rights of eligible voters. The lawsuits are part of a broader initiative to address concerns about voter access and election integrity in the United States. Through these legal actions, the Justice Department seeks to enforce compliance and ensure that all eligible voters are able to register and participate in elections without unnecessary barriers.
