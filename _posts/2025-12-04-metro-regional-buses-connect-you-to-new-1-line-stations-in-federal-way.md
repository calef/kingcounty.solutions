King County Metro has introduced new regional bus connections to the recently opened 1 Line light rail stations in Federal Way. With the expansion of the light rail, Metro is enhancing public transportation options, making it easier for riders to access key destinations. The new bus routes will serve various neighborhoods and provide direct connections to the light rail, facilitating smoother transfers for commuters. This initiative is part of Metro’s commitment to improving mobility and supporting the growing demand for public transit in the region. 

The service changes aim to better align with the light rail schedule, ensuring that riders can seamlessly transition between bus and rail services. Additionally, Metro encourages residents to explore the new transportation options, which are designed to enhance accessibility and reduce travel times. The integration of bus and rail services is expected to significantly benefit the community by promoting sustainable transit solutions and connecting people to work, school, and other essential services. As these changes take effect, Metro remains focused on providing reliable and efficient transportation to support the needs of Federal Way residents and visitors.
