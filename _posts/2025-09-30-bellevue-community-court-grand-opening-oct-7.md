The Bellevue Community Court will officially open on October 7, from 1-2:30 PM at the Bellevue Library. This new therapeutic court, established through collaboration between the King County District Court, the City of Bellevue, and the King County Library System, aims to address non-violent misdemeanor cases by tackling the underlying issues contributing to criminal behavior. The court will operate every Tuesday from 2-4 PM at the library. It includes a co-located Bellevue Community Resource Center that offers services such as mental health and substance-use counseling, as well as job search assistance. Judge Lisa O’Toole will oversee the court, which functions similarly to traditional courts but focuses on accountability and rehabilitation. Bellevue Mayor Lynne Robinson emphasized the court's role in removing barriers and improving outcomes for participants. The initiative is part of a broader effort to foster safer communities and reduce recidivism rates. Community members interested in volunteering can reach out to court coordinator Andrew Lorenzen.
