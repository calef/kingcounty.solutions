  Community invited to learn about new therapeutic court held at the Bellevue Library

  To build stronger and safer communities and help prevent repeated criminal behavior, [King County District Court&nbsp;](https://kingcounty.gov/en/court/district-court),&nbsp;the City of Bellevue and the King County Library System’s [Bellevue Library](https://kcls.org/locations/bellevue/) are collaborating to implement a community court in Bellevue. The three agencies will hold a grand opening for the court Tuesday, Oct. 7, 1- 2:30 p.m. at the Bellevue Library (1111 110th Ave. NE).

  Bellevue Community Court is an alternative court for eligible, non-violent, less serious (misdemeanor) cases. It works to identify and address the underlying challenges people face that often contribute to criminal activity. The goal is to hold them accountable, while helping them improve their personal situations and become productive community members.

  Bellevue Community Court is held Tuesdays 2–4 p.m. at the Bellevue Library.

The Bellevue Community Court will officially open on Oct. 7 from 1 to 2:30 p.m. at the Bellevue Library. This new therapeutic court, established through collaboration between the King County District Court, the City of Bellevue, and the King County Library System, aims to address nonviolent misdemeanor cases by tackling the underlying issues contributing to criminal behavior. The court will operate every Tuesday from 2 to 4 p.m. at the library. It includes a co-located Bellevue Community Resource Center that offers services such as mental health and substance use counseling, as well as job search assistance. Judge Lisa O’Toole will oversee the court, which functions similarly to traditional courts but focuses on accountability and rehabilitation. Bellevue Mayor Lynne Robinson emphasized the court's role in removing barriers and improving outcomes for participants. The initiative is part of a broader effort to foster safer communities and reduce recidivism rates. Community members interested in volunteering can reach out to court coordinator Andrew Lorenzen.
