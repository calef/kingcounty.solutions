Students at Interagency Academy participated in a 12-week cooking program called Recipes for Success, led by Solid Ground Youth Food Educators. This initiative, a collaboration with PCC Community Markets and Organically Grown, aims to teach essential cooking skills alongside social-emotional learning. Each week, students visited PCC's demonstration kitchen to learn about cooking, food safety, and teamwork while preparing various recipes, including banh mi sandwiches and innovative cookies.

The program encourages creativity in the kitchen, allowing students to experiment with ingredients and work collaboratively. In addition to culinary skills, it fosters self-motivation and communication, helping students who may struggle in traditional classroom settings. Many students expressed increased confidence in their cooking abilities and found joy in the learning process.

The program addresses food access challenges faced by students, providing fresh meals and a space for building community relationships. With its success, there are plans to continue and potentially expand the program to other schools, highlighting the importance of equitable access to cooking education and nutritious food.
