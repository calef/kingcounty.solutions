  class=\"wp-caption-text\">Students listen to Kai explaining the recipes and cooking
  skills they&#8217;ll soon tackle (photo by Rachael Green).</p></div>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">This
  is one of countless lessons students from </span><a href=\"https://interagency.seattleschools.org/\"><span
  data-contrast=\"none\">Interagency Academy</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">
  in Columbia City learned over the course of 12 weeks this spring with Kai and Bela
  Sanchez, Solid Ground Youth Food Educators. While chopping vegetables and measuring
  flour, the students have learned and practiced everything from knife skills and
  food safety to time management and conflict resolution, all designed to support
  their success both in the kitchen and in the classroom.</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">“I&#8217;m
  seeing a lot more self-motivation,” says Brandon Sanchez, a Family Support Specialist
  at the high school, which is part of Seattle Public Schools. “There&#8217;s more
  conversation and joy around what they&#8217;re doing in our classroom.”</span></p>\n<p><span
  data-contrast=\"auto\">The program, called Recipes for Success, is a new and one-of-a-kind
  partnership between <a href=\"https://www.solid-ground.org/what-we-do/food-access-education/\">Solid
  Ground Community Food Education</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pccmarkets.com/\">PCC
  Community Markets</a>, <a href=\"https://www.organicgrown.com/\">Organically Grown</a>,
  and the southeast campus of Interagency Academy, an alternative public high school
  that serves students who do best with kinds of support not available in traditional
  schools. The growing partnership is the latest extension of Solid Ground’s ongoing
  mission of empowering communities with the knowledge and access needed to prepare
  healthy, fresh, and culturally appropriate meals in their own homes.</span></p>\n<p><span
  data-contrast=\"auto\">“Things like cooking classes obviously aren’t equitably available
  to all kids,” Bela says. “So being able to provide these classes for students who
  maybe otherwise wouldn&#8217;t be able to access them feels like a really unique
  and exciting opportunity.”</span></p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Recipes for Success\"

  style=\"color: #4d5909;\">&#8216;Go for it!’ </span></h4>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Every
  Wednesday this spring, the students left their school building just off Rainier
  Avenue South and crossed the street to PCC’s state-of-the-art demonstration kitchen,
  which Kai and Bela stocked with ingredients provided by the co-op and Organically
  Grown. Students start class with a snack – usually fresh fruit – while going over
  the recipes of the day and the individual skill lessons that are built into them.
  Over the course of the program, students made everything from pozole to ravioli,
  many of the recipes suggested by students based on meals their own families prepare
  at home.</span></p>\n<blockquote class=\"tmc-quote\">\n<p class=\"tmc-caption\"><span
  data-contrast=\"auto\"><span style=\"color: #4d5909;\">“Personally, I’m not very
  comfortable in the kitchen, but practicing my skills here, learning how to read
  a recipe and all that stuff, I feel like I’m more capable to make something in the
  kitchen by myself.”</span> </span></p>\n<p class=\"tmc-caption\" style=\"text-align:
  right;\"><span class=\"tmc-subhead-semi\"><span style=\"color: #595959;\">~Ibri,
  Interagency student</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">“The
  idea behind the partnership was to connect students with really high-quality food
  and high-quality cooking education, and to give them high school credit at the same
  time,” says Bela. “It&#8217;s really focused more on home cooking, how to get comfortable
  in the kitchen, how to read a recipe, basic knife skills and measuring skills, and
  covering a pretty wide range of recipes, both new-to-them recipes and recipes they’ve
  requested.”</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">On this particular Wednesday
  – the second-to-last of the semester – the students are making Vietnamese banh mi
  sandwiches and &#8220;Add Anything&#8221; drop cookies. For the cookies, students
  can choose from a selection of sweet and savory add-ins – chocolate candies, potato
  chips, etc. – or they can get creative and mix in something else entirely unexpected
  from the grocery store.</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">“PCC is your
  oyster!” Kai instructs the students – because while learning how to read recipes
  is one of the program’s key lessons, the students are also encouraged to experiment
  with different ingredients, flavors, and textures. “There&#8217;s certainly not
  a you-have-to-stick-to-the-recipe rule,” Kai says. “It&#8217;s like, ‘If you think
  that would be good, go for it! Try it out!”</span></p>\n<h4 class=\"tmc-medium\"><span
  style=\"color: #4d5909;\">Social-emotional learning in the kitchen </span></h4>\n<p><span
  data-contrast=\"auto\">After the snack, the students gather around the counter as
  Kai and Bela show them how to zero out a digital scale, compare the volume of sugar
  to its weight, and tell the difference between the shorthand notations for teaspoon
  and tablespoon.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_70286\"

  teens then split off into teams to weigh and mix their cookie dough, trying to get
  as close as possible, in grams, to the prescribed weight of each ingredient. They
  take turns measuring, fetching ingredients, and breaking up clumps of brown sugar,
  laughing and gently teasing each other as they work. One pair debate whether to
  mix potato chips into their dough, considering what it would do to the cookies’
  flavor and whether they would crunch them up or add them whole. They decide to go
  for it.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Bela
  and Kai say these interactions are a key part of program, giving the teens a safe
  space to build social-emotional skills that apply to life far beyond the kitchen.</span></p>\n<blockquote
  class=\"tmc-quote\">\n<p class=\"tmc-caption\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\"><span
  style=\"color: #4d5909;\">“I mostly enjoyed getting to learn new thing and working
  with more people in the kitchen because I find cooking a lot of fun, and I feel
  like I need to learn more about communications and working with people.”</span>

  style=\"color: #595959;\"><span class=\"tmc-subhead-semi\">~Zaraya, Interagency
  student</span> </span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">“It’s
  all about how to work with other people, communicating really clearly about how
  you&#8217;re dividing tasks and who&#8217;s doing what. And if you&#8217;re frustrated
  about what your partner is doing, are you communicating to them that you&#8217;re
  frustrated? Or are you just getting frustrated, not saying anything, and then having
  a harder time?” Bela says. “All those interactions are to me one of the most important
  things about this class, because social-emotional learning carries through every
  aspect of your life.”</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">“It’s
  also an opportunity to have a really hands-on class that they get credit for and
  that works well for some students that may have a harder time with a more traditional
  school class structure,” Kai says. “There are a couple of students who staff have
  said struggle with attending regularly in their other classes but have been coming
  really regularly here, and say that this style of learning is working for them.”</span><span

  the counter, watching Kai demonstrate a technique for julienning carrots and daikon
  radishes for the banh mi. Then it’s back to their stations to neatly chop the vegetables,
  which are then quick-pickled. When it’s all done, the students take turns building
  their own lunch from French rolls filled with butter, liver spread, mayo, shredded
  chicken, jalapeño, and the pickled carrots and radishes. As they share the meal
  they’ve prepared together, Kai and Bela hand out $15 PCC gift certificates that
  students can use to buy groceries at the co-op after class.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<h4
  class=\"tmc-medium\"><span style=\"color: #4d5909;\">Solutions based on community,
  partnership</span></h4>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">This shared meal at the
  end of each class is what sparked the program’s two years ago. At the time, Kerri
  Hunsley, the Store Director for PCC in Columbia City, had noticed an increase in
  the loss of prepared food items and began asking questions to better understand
  what needs might exist in the broader community.</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">During
  that process, she learned that Interagency Academy at the Columbia Annex next door
  did not offer a hot meals program like many other Seattle public schools. Instead,
  students receive meals that are prepared off site, usually consisting of packaged
  cold-cut items, salads, sandwiches, fruit and vegetables, and occasionally microwaveable
  items. The school does have microwaves, but they offered only a limited and inconsistent
  solution.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}\"> </span></p>\n<blockquote
  class=\"tmc-quote\">\n<p class=\"tmc-caption\"><span data-contrast=\"none\"><span
  style=\"color: #4d5909;\">“It’s really fun learning the new skills, because before
  I didn’t really know how to cook. I knew how to kind of heat things up and then,
  and best, hopefully not let it burn.”</span> </span></p>\n<p class=\"tmc-caption\"
  style=\"text-align: right;\"><span data-contrast=\"none\"><span style=\"color: #595959;\"><span
  class=\"tmc-subhead-semi\">~Keo, Interagency student</span> </span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span
  data-contrast=\"none\">Brandon at Interagency says many students at the school also
  face significant barriers to food access </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">–</span><span
  data-contrast=\"none\"> including housing instability, financial hardship, and lack
  of transportation </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">–</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">
  that make it difficult for them to bring lunch from home or purchase meals elsewhere.
  So rather than respond with assumptions or punishment, Kerri reached out to Brandon
  at Interagency to build a restorative partnership rooted in community, trust, and
  care.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span
  data-contrast=\"auto\">“She wanted to figure out a way to actually build a community
  relationship with our students and the co-op, and just let them know, ‘We see you.
  We are here to support you,’” Brandon says.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span
  data-contrast=\"auto\">Together, they created a program that provides students with
  access to fresh, free meals, cooking education, and credit-earning life skills that
  support their overall well-being. Brandon says the initiative continues to demonstrate
  the power of community-centered solutions that restore dignity, build relationships,
  and address needs without stigma.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<div

  data-contrast=\"auto\">Kerri started by arranging to have pastries, bagels, and
  other breakfast items set aside for the school each morning. Brandon talked to students
  about PCC’s support as a community partner, and the response was such a success
  that the two began talking about other ways to collaborate.</span></p>\n<p><span
  data-contrast=\"auto\">“I wanted to do something more for the kids that would allow
  them to walk away with a skill, something they can get out of it that they can use
  in their life,” Kerri said. “I wanted them to know, ‘Hey, we care about you, and
  we want to do something nice for you.’&#8221;</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span
  data-contrast=\"auto\">PCC has been a longtime partner and supporter of Solid Ground,
  so the co-op reached out about putting together a cooking program for Interagency.
  Organically Grown, another longtime PCC partner, was soon on board as well.</span></p>\n<p><span
  data-contrast=\"auto\">&#8220;The big win was when the curriculum was reviewed and
  approved by the school district, which meant the students could get school credit
  for the classes,” says Michael Friedman, Solid Ground’s Community Food Education
  Program Manager. “This elevated the project from extra-curricular or a fun elective
  to something the students could use to help them move toward graduation.”</span></p>\n<h4
  class=\"tmc-medium\"><span style=\"color: #4d5909;\">A success to build on </span></h4>\n<p><span
  data-contrast=\"auto\">It took another year to get the partnership off the ground,
  but the first semester in the spring of 2025 was seen as a huge success – by both
  the partners and the students who participated.</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">“Personally,
  I wasn&#8217;t very comfortable in the kitchen,” says Ibri Ramirez, an 18-year-old
  student at Interagency. “But practicing my skills here, learning how to read a recipe
  and all that stuff, I feel like I&#8217;m more capable of making something in the
  kitchen by myself.”</span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Recipes for Success
  is set to start up again in the fall with another batch of students, and Interagency
  and PCC are both looking at the possibility of replicating the program elsewhere
  in Seattle Public Schools and beyond.</span></p>\n<hr />\n<style>#jtg-70318 .modula-item

  carefully chopping carrots on individual wood cutting boards.](https://s14621.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025_05_07_SG_CookingClass_DNG045-801x-361x255.jpg)\n\nLined
  up along one side of a stainless-steel countertop, knives and cutting boards positioned
  in front of them, a half dozen teenagers listen attentively as Kai Bahls explains
  how cooking can require both creativity and precision at the same time.\n\n“When
  you’re baking, you have to pay really close attention to those measurements,” they
  say. “A half teaspoon of baking powder versus a half tablespoon will make a big
  difference.”\n\n ![Half a dozen teenagers stand along a stainless steel kitchen
  countertop listing to a pair of instructors.](https://s14621.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025_05_07_SG_CookingClass_DNG035_400x.jpg)\n\nStudents
  listen to Kai explaining the recipes and cooking skills they’ll soon tackle (photo
  by Rachael Green).\n\nThis is one of countless lessons students from [Interagency
  Academy](https://interagency.seattleschools.org/) in Columbia City learned over
  the course of 12 weeks this spring with Kai and Bela Sanchez, Solid Ground Youth
  Food Educators. While chopping vegetables and measuring flour, the students have
  learned and practiced everything from knife skills and food safety to time management
  and conflict resolution, all designed to support their success both in the kitchen
  and in the classroom.\n\n“I’m seeing a lot more self-motivation,” says Brandon Sanchez,
  a Family Support Specialist at the high school, which is part of Seattle Public
  Schools. “There’s more conversation and joy around what they’re doing in our classroom.”\n\nThe
  program, called Recipes for Success, is a new and one-of-a-kind partnership between
  [Solid Ground Community Food Education](https://www.solid-ground.org/what-we-do/food-access-education/),
  [PCC Community Markets](https://www.pccmarkets.com/), [Organically Grown](https://www.organicgrown.com/),
  and the southeast campus of Interagency Academy, an alternative public high school
  that serves students who do best with kinds of support not available in traditional
  schools. The growing partnership is the latest extension of Solid Ground’s ongoing
  mission of empowering communities with the knowledge and access needed to prepare
  healthy, fresh, and culturally appropriate meals in their own homes.\n\n“Things
  like cooking classes obviously aren’t equitably available to all kids,” Bela says.
  “So being able to provide these classes for students who maybe otherwise wouldn’t
  be able to access them feels like a really unique and exciting opportunity.”\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/SAdOSLMdXIc?feature=oembed\n\n**_Solid

  \ \n\n#### ‘Go for it!’&nbsp;\n\nEvery Wednesday this spring, the students left
  their school building just off Rainier Avenue South and crossed the street to PCC’s
  state-of-the-art demonstration kitchen, which Kai and Bela stocked with ingredients
  provided by the co-op and Organically Grown. Students start class with a snack –
  usually fresh fruit – while going over the recipes of the day and the individual
  skill lessons that are built into them. Over the course of the program, students
  made everything from pozole to ravioli, many of the recipes suggested by students
  based on meals their own families prepare at home.\n\n> “Personally, I’m not very
  comfortable in the kitchen, but practicing my skills here, learning how to read
  a recipe and all that stuff, I feel like I’m more capable to make something in the
  kitchen by myself.”\n> \n> ~Ibri, Interagency student\n\n“The idea behind the partnership
  was to connect students with really high-quality food and high-quality cooking education,
  and to give them high school credit at the same time,” says Bela. “It’s really focused
  more on home cooking, how to get comfortable in the kitchen, how to read a recipe,
  basic knife skills and measuring skills, and covering a pretty wide range of recipes,
  both new-to-them recipes and recipes they’ve requested.”\n\nOn this particular Wednesday
  – the second-to-last of the semester – the students are making Vietnamese banh mi
  sandwiches and “Add Anything” drop cookies. For the cookies, students can choose
  from a selection of sweet and savory add-ins – chocolate candies, potato chips,
  etc. – or they can get creative and mix in something else entirely unexpected from
  the grocery store.\n\n“PCC is your oyster!” Kai instructs the students – because
  while learning how to read recipes is one of the program’s key lessons, the students
  are also encouraged to experiment with different ingredients, flavors, and textures.
  “There’s certainly not a you-have-to-stick-to-the-recipe rule,” Kai says. “It’s
  like, ‘If you think that would be good, go for it! Try it out!”\n\n#### Social-emotional
  learning in the kitchen&nbsp;\n\nAfter the snack, the students gather around the
  counter as Kai and Bela show them how to zero out a digital scale, compare the volume
  of sugar to its weight, and tell the difference between the shorthand notations
  for teaspoon and tablespoon.&nbsp;\n\n ![A young woman standing over a metal mixing
  bowl in a kitchen gestures with one hand while an instructor and another student
  look on.](https://s14621.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025_05_07_SG_CookingClass_DNG019-400x.jpg)\n\nMeasuring
  ingredients for “Add Anything” drop cookies (photo by Rachael Green)\n\nThe teens
  then split off into teams to weigh and mix their cookie dough, trying to get as
  close as possible, in grams, to the prescribed weight of each ingredient. They take
  turns measuring, fetching ingredients, and breaking up clumps of brown sugar, laughing
  and gently teasing each other as they work. One pair debate whether to mix potato
  chips into their dough, considering what it would do to the cookies’ flavor and
  whether they would crunch them up or add them whole. They decide to go for it.&nbsp;\n\nBela
  and Kai say these interactions are a key part of program, giving the teens a safe
  space to build social-emotional skills that apply to life far beyond the kitchen.\n\n>
  “I mostly enjoyed getting to learn new thing and working with more people in the
  kitchen because I find cooking a lot of fun, and I feel like I need to learn more
  about communications and working with people.”\n> \n> ~Zaraya, Interagency student&nbsp;\n\n“It’s
  all about how to work with other people, communicating really clearly about how
  you’re dividing tasks and who’s doing what. And if you’re frustrated about what
  your partner is doing, are you communicating to them that you’re frustrated? Or
  are you just getting frustrated, not saying anything, and then having a harder time?”
  Bela says. “All those interactions are to me one of the most important things about
  this class, because social-emotional learning carries through every aspect of your
  life.”&nbsp;\n\n“It’s also an opportunity to have a really hands-on class that they
  get credit for and that works well for some students that may have a harder time
  with a more traditional school class structure,” Kai says. “There are a couple of
  students who staff have said struggle with attending regularly in their other classes
  but have been coming really regularly here, and say that this style of learning
  is working for them.”&nbsp;\n\n ![A cooking instructor standing in front of a counter
  piled with ingredients holds out a julienned carrot as two students look on.](https://s14621.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2025_05_07_SG_CookingClass_DNG038-400.jpg)\n\nKai
  demonstrates how to julienne a carrot (photo by Rachael Green).\n\nThe students
  are soon back at the counter, watching Kai demonstrate a technique for julienning
  carrots and daikon radishes for the banh mi. Then it’s back to their stations to
  neatly chop the vegetables, which are then quick-pickled. When it’s all done, the
  students take turns building their own lunch from French rolls filled with butter,
  liver spread, mayo, shredded chicken, jalapeño, and the pickled carrots and radishes.
  As they share the meal they’ve prepared together, Kai and Bela hand out $15 PCC
  gift certificates that students can use to buy groceries at the co-op after class.&nbsp;\n\n####
  Solutions based on community, partnership\n\nThis shared meal at the end of each
  class is what sparked the program’s two years ago. At the time, Kerri Hunsley, the
  Store Director for PCC in Columbia City, had noticed an increase in the loss of
  prepared food items and began asking questions to better understand what needs might
  exist in the broader community.\n\nDuring that process, she learned that Interagency
  Academy at the Columbia Annex next door did not offer a hot meals program like many
  other Seattle public schools. Instead, students receive meals that are prepared
  off site, usually consisting of packaged cold-cut items, salads, sandwiches, fruit
  and vegetables, and occasionally microwaveable items. The school does have microwaves,
  but they offered only a limited and inconsistent solution.&nbsp;\n\n> “It’s really
  fun learning the new skills, because before I didn’t really know how to cook. I
  knew how to kind of heat things up and then, and best, hopefully not let it burn.”\n>
  \n> ~Keo, Interagency student&nbsp;\n\nBrandon at Interagency says many students
  at the school also face significant barriers to food access – including housing
  instability, financial hardship, and lack of transportation – that make it difficult
  for them to bring lunch from home or purchase meals elsewhere. So rather than respond
  with assumptions or punishment, Kerri reached out to Brandon at Interagency to build
  a restorative partnership rooted in community, trust, and care.&nbsp;\n\n“She wanted
  to figure out a way to actually build a community relationship with our students
  and the co-op, and just let them know, ‘We see you. We are here to support you,’”
  Brandon says.&nbsp;\n\nTogether, they created a program that provides students with
  access to fresh, free meals, cooking education, and credit-earning life skills that
  support their overall well-being. Brandon says the initiative continues to demonstrate
  the power of community-centered solutions that restore dignity, build relationships,
  and address needs without stigma.&nbsp;\n\n ![A group of students and instructors

  end the class by sharing a lunch of banh mi sandwiches and drop cookies of their
  own invention (photo by Rachael Green).\n\nKerri started by arranging to have pastries,
  bagels, and other breakfast items set aside for the school each morning. Brandon
  talked to students about PCC’s support as a community partner, and the response
  was such a success that the two began talking about other ways to collaborate.\n\n“I
  wanted to do something more for the kids that would allow them to walk away with
  a skill, something they can get out of it that they can use in their life,” Kerri
  said. “I wanted them to know, ‘Hey, we care about you, and we want to do something
  nice for you.’”&nbsp;\n\nPCC has been a longtime partner and supporter of Solid
  Ground, so the co-op reached out about putting together a cooking program for Interagency.
  Organically Grown, another longtime PCC partner, was soon on board as well.\n\n“The
  big win was when the curriculum was reviewed and approved by the school district,
  which meant the students could get school credit for the classes,” says Michael
  Friedman, Solid Ground’s Community Food Education Program Manager. “This elevated
  the project from extra-curricular or a fun elective to something the students could
  use to help them move toward graduation.”\n\n#### A success to build on&nbsp;\n\nIt
  took another year to get the partnership off the ground, but the first semester
  in the spring of 2025 was seen as a huge success – by both the partners and the
  students who participated.\n\n“Personally, I wasn’t very comfortable in the kitchen,”
  says Ibri Ramirez, an 18-year-old student at Interagency. “But practicing my skills
  here, learning how to read a recipe and all that stuff, I feel like I’m more capable
  of making something in the kitchen by myself.”\n\nRecipes for Success is set to
  start up again in the fall with another batch of students, and Interagency and PCC
  are both looking at the possibility of replicating the program elsewhere in Seattle
  Public Schools and beyond.\n\n* * *\n<style>#jtg-70318 .modula-item .jtg-social

Students at Interagency Academy participated in a 12-week cooking program called Recipes for Success, led by Solid Ground Youth Food Educators. This initiative, a collaboration with PCC Community Markets and Organically Grown, aims to teach essential cooking skills alongside social-emotional learning. Each week, students visited PCC's demonstration kitchen to learn about cooking, food safety, and teamwork while preparing various recipes, including banh mi sandwiches and innovative cookies.

The program encourages creativity in the kitchen, allowing students to experiment with ingredients and work collaboratively. In addition to culinary skills, it fosters self-motivation and communication, helping students who may struggle in traditional classroom settings. Many students expressed increased confidence in their cooking abilities and found joy in the learning process.

The program addresses food access challenges faced by students, providing fresh meals and a space for building community relationships. With its success, there are plans to continue and potentially expand the program to other schools, highlighting the importance of equitable access to cooking education and nutritious food.
