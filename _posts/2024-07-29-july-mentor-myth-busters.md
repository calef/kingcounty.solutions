  people ask how to become [Youth Success Mentors](https://empoweryouthnetwork.org/youth-success-mentoring/)
  with Empower Youth Network (EYN), there are some commonly asked questions that we
  encounter. With our Back-to-School Challenge coming up, we will be sharing Mentor
  Myth Busters with you!\n\nWondering about the time commitment, effort, or energy
  it takes to be a mentor? Read testimonials below that share why mentoring is worth
  it, and why mentoring is probably even more feasible than you might think.\n\n**Rob:<u><br>\n</u>
  **_“There was no hesitation to me signing up.”_&nbsp; Rob is retired and wanted
  to fill his time. Meeting, talking, and listening to a young person who is asking
  for a mentor was a _“no brainer”_ to him. His mentoring sessions are about an hour
  a week** including** travel time to the school. As for taking vacations or needing
  to skip a session every now and then, Rob says that is an easy process. _“Clear,
  timely and respectful communication between all the parties (mentee, teacher, school
  counselor, and Heather) is all that is required.”_&nbsp; Rob tries to give at least
  two weeks’ notice as a minimum, which we appreciate!\n\n**Mary:<u><br>\n</u>**Mary
  had just moved to the valley and did not know many people. She was not sure how
  to get involved to meet people and help in her newfound community. So, Mary started
  mentoring. _“It has been amazing, I have met fabulous people, the program and school
  has been so helpful and supportive plus the connection I have made with my mentee
  is the best. I can’t wait for next year to meet with my mentee and meet more people.”_\n\n**Star:<u><br>\n</u>**As
  far as initial barriers to pursuing mentoring, Star initially did not know what
  to expect, whether she would be accepted, or how mentoring would work. But it would
  not leave her mind until she finally took the first step, and when she did, she
  says there was good support along the way. _“It is a commitment, and the consistency
  is very important to these kids, however, as long as there is good communication,
  if you have to miss it can be worked out.”&nbsp;_ Life happens, and EYN understand
  that. This past year Star had a trip planned during school, she needed to schedule
  an oral surgery, and one week she was sick. EYN figured out how to cover for Star
  so her mentee was set up for success while she was away. Star said that going away
  can even be helpful because it gave her stories to share with her mentee!\n\n**Barb:**
  \ \n_“The only barrier I could see to signing up to be a mentor was the one in my
  mind. I kept intending to do it and then put it off many times until I finally just
  did it. For me it has been a great experience.”_&nbsp; Barb said that EYN has made
  mentoring very easy to fit into her schedule, and that the staff at the school are
  super friendly and helpful. _“I love feeling a part of something good. I love that
  I get to see my mentee growing up and gaining confidence in himself. He is so smart
  and funny. Just a nice, cool kid.”_\n\nHelp us get a head start on our Back-to-School
  Challenge, and [apply to become a mentor today](https://empoweryouthnetwork.org/youth-success-mentoring/)!"

The Empower Youth Network (EYN) addresses common misconceptions about becoming a Youth Success Mentor with their 'Mentor Myth Busters' initiative. Many potential mentors often worry about time commitment and effort, but testimonials from current mentors show that mentoring is feasible and rewarding. They share that the commitment is about an hour a week, with flexibility for vacations or other commitments. The key is clear and respectful communication with all parties involved. Mentors find the experience fulfilling, forming meaningful connections with mentees and feeling part of something positive in their community. EYN encourages more people to become mentors.
