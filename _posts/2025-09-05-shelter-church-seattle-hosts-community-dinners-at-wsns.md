Every Friday at 5 pm, All Souls and Shelter Church Seattle host a community dinner at the Westside Neighbors Shelter located in the American Legion Hall, 3620 SW Alaska. This event is open to everyone, regardless of faith, and aims to foster community spirit. Attendees are invited to enjoy a hearty meal followed by a discussion, although participation in the discussion is optional. Guests can choose to attend solely for the meal if they prefer. The initiative emphasizes inclusivity and community engagement, making it a welcoming space for all.
