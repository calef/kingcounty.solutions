Eddie and Vanessa have lived in Kingway Apartments for nearly 30 years, emphasizing the significance of affordable housing and community support for families in Greater Seattle. They moved to Kingway in 1998, where Eddie joined Bellwether Housing's maintenance team, while Vanessa, a lifelong Seattleite, followed his lead and took on roles from assistant site manager to front desk coordinator. For them, affordable housing is crucial; without it, they couldn't afford to live in Seattle, even as a two-income household. Their strong community ties have fostered a sense of belonging, allowing them to witness their children grow up in Kingway, and now their grandchildren. Vanessa expresses pride in her family continuing this legacy in the same community. Both feel a deep connection between their work and home, enhancing their commitment to the community. Vanessa highlights her love for her colleagues and the fulfillment she finds in helping others. Their journey illustrates how affordable housing plays a vital role in keeping families connected and strengthening community bonds, showcasing the positive impact of Bellwether Housing on the lives of residents.
