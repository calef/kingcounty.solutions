Operations at the King County Regional Homeless Authority (KCRHA) remain unaffected by the government shutdown, continuing as normal alongside contracted providers. Most of KCRHA’s funding originates from local sources that are insulated from federal actions. Furthermore, KCRHA retains access to federal funds that support regional homelessness services, ensuring the ability to receive payments for services rendered is not interrupted. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced a contingency plan on September 29 to address potential funding gaps during the shutdown. Communities that benefit from Community Development Block Grants (CDBG), Emergency Solutions Grants (ESG), Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS (HOPWA), and other Community Planning and Development (CPD) grants will still be able to access these funds during the federal funding lapse. KCRHA staff are closely monitoring the situation as it evolves. Contracted providers are encouraged to reach out to their contract leads for any inquiries.
