The Washington State Department of Commerce's Community Reinvestment Program (CRP) is launching three funding opportunities. These grants are region-based, with one grantee selected per region. The grants are for organizations serving individuals, not individuals themselves. The three grants are for Reentry Services, providing wraparound services before and after release; Legal Assistance Services, supporting post-conviction relief and case assistance; and Local Advisory Teams, supporting the creation of teams to distribute funding to community partners. Awards range from $67,000 to $1,232,000 depending on the grant. Further details will be posted on Commerce’s contracting webpage.
