  per region. Interested applicants may apply for multiple opportunities or regions.\n\n![](https://www.commerce.wa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CRP-2025-2027-Map-v4-1024x758.jpg)\n\nThe

  organizations, tribes and others who meet the qualifications are eligible for grants
  from Commerce. Each specific grant opportunity will include more information about
  eligible organizations and qualifications when it is released.\n\nPlease note that
  these grants are not for individuals. They are for organizations who will be running
  programs to serve individuals. Once Commerce contracts with organizations to provide
  individual services, we will list all grantees on CRP’s funding opportunities page.\n\n###
  Reentry Services\n\n- **What this grant funds:** Funding will support wraparound
  services before and after release. This can include pre-release planning, post-release
  navigation, healing-centered practices and access to employment and training.\n-
  **Estimated awards:** Commerce will award up to 12 grants between $80,000 and $400,000.\n\n###
  Legal Assistance Services\n\n- **What this grant funds:** Funding will support statewide,
  community-based post-conviction relief and case assistance. Support must focus on
  civil and criminal legal assistance that removes systemic barriers and expands access
  to opportunity. Programs should prioritize individuals disproportionately impacted
  by the criminal legal system.\n- **Estimated awards:** Commerce will award up to
  12 grants between $67,000 and $330,000.\n\n### Local Advisory Teams\n\n- **What
  this grant funds:** Funding will support the creation of 12 local advisory teams
  (LATs), who will help distribute funding to community partners. The LATs will advise
  how CRP funding supports mentorship-based programs and community-led violence prevention
  strategies. They will support an infrastructure to distribute grants in their communities.\n-
  **Estimated awards:** Commerce will award up to 12 grants between $271,000 and $1,232,000.
  The majority of these funds will be used for LATs to pass through funds to organizations
  in their community that deliver services.\n\nAll funding opportunities will be posted
  on [Commerce’s contracting webpage](https://www.commerce.wa.gov/contracting/) and
  sent out over CRP’s mailing list. To ensure you receive future updates, please visit

The Washington State Department of Commerce's Community Reinvestment Program (CRP) is launching three funding opportunities. These grants are region-based, with one grantee selected per region. The grants are for organizations serving individuals, not individuals themselves. The three grants are for Reentry Services, providing wraparound services before and after release; Legal Assistance Services, supporting post-conviction relief and case assistance; and Local Advisory Teams, supporting the creation of teams to distribute funding to community partners. Awards range from $67,000 to $1,232,000 depending on the grant. Further details will be posted on Commerce’s contracting webpage.
