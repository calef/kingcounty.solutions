After a challenging pregnancy and Cayden's premature birth at 33 weeks, his parents faced an unexpected journey when he was diagnosed with Cardio-Facio-Cutaneous Syndrome at just two weeks old. This rare condition brought numerous health challenges, leading them to seek specialized care. They connected with Boyer Children's Clinic, where a team of therapists, including an occupational therapist, physical therapist, speech therapist, and vision specialist, began supporting Cayden's development after his NICU stay. 

Cayden's parents express deep gratitude for the invaluable assistance and guidance they received from the Boyer team, which helped them navigate the complexities of raising a medically complex child. They provided essential resources such as therapy recommendations and feeding strategies, ensuring Cayden could reach his fullest potential. As Cayden approaches his third birthday and graduation from the program, his mother reflects on the profound impact the team has had on their family, acknowledging their dedication to Cayden's progress. She celebrates his determination to overcome challenges and credits Boyer with being a crucial support system during this transformative journey.
