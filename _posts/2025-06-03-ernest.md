Ernest experienced profound grief after the death of his best friend, which left him without a home. His friend's son referred him to Bread of Life Mission, where he found support and community. Overwhelmed by the kindness he received from staff and fellow guests, Ernest began to heal and set new goals for his future. He participated in the Life Change Recovery Program, learning valuable skills and finding joy in helping others, such as making sack lunches and assisting in the kitchen. Grateful for the Mission's support, he had a safe place to stay and access to basic needs. Ernest has successfully transitioned back to independent living and found a home of his own, expressing gratitude for the friendships he formed and the encouragement he received. He hopes others will support the Mission, emphasizing the importance of helping those in need.
