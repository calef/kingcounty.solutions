  <p>In 1925, the <a href="https://communityrootshousing.org/building/devonshire/">Devonshire Apartments</a> opened its doors in Seattle&#8217;s Belltown neighborhood. With its distinctive brick façade, the Devonshire, designed by architect Herbert Bittman, combined functionality and form: the courtyard capped the garage. Since then, more than 1,300 residents have called Devonshire home.</p>
  <h3>From crisis to catalyst</h3>
  <p>In 1993, Community Roots Housing acquired the property, preserving it as <a href="https://www.preservationcompact.org/innovation/noah/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">naturally occurring affordable housing</a>. For decades, the building&#8217;s age allowed it to remain affordable to working residents even as the city around it changed dramatically. But nearly a hundred years after its grand opening, the Devonshire was in crisis. In 2023, the building&#8217;s hot water system began to fail, prompting an urgent need for a property-wide replacement. However, where there is crisis, there is also opportunity.</p>
  <p>Rather than simply patching the problem, in partnership with the City of Seattle Office of Housing, Community Roots chose to undertake a <a href="https://communityrootshousing.org/2024/07/preserving-affordable-housing-belltown/">complete gut rehabilitation</a> — an ambitious and vital effort to preserve the Devonshire&#8217;s legacy while bringing its systems, safety features, and livability into the 21st century.</p>

  <h3>Historic charm, modern interiors</h3>
  <p>Construction took each floor down to its concrete base, creating a blank slate within the original brick envelope. The building underwent seismic upgrades, including steel reinforcements and sheer walls. As a result, it will be removed from the City of Seattle&#8217;s Unreinforced Masonry list. The team also installed a new fire sprinkler system and completely replaced the HVAC, plumbing, and electrical systems, bringing them up to modern building and energy codes.</p>

Community Roots Housing has completed a major renovation of the historic Devonshire Apartments in Seattle's Belltown neighborhood, originally opened in 1925. Acquired by Community Roots in 1993, the Devonshire has served as affordable housing, but faced challenges when its hot water system failed in 2023. Instead of a simple fix, a comprehensive gut rehabilitation was undertaken in partnership with the City of Seattle Office of Housing, modernizing the building while preserving its historic charm.

The renovation involved extensive structural upgrades, including seismic reinforcements and the installation of a new fire sprinkler system. All HVAC, plumbing, and electrical systems were replaced to meet current building codes. Interior updates include LED lighting, stainless steel appliances, and ADA-compliant layouts, while original features like terrazzo floors and woodwork have been preserved.

On June 4, 2025, a ribbon-cutting ceremony celebrated the completion of the project, attended by local officials and community members. The Devonshire now offers 62 affordable homes for individuals and families earning between 50% and 60% of the area median income, with rents starting at just over $1,000. All units are currently occupied or have pending applications, highlighting the ongoing demand for affordable housing in the area.
