As the fentanyl crisis escalates, Ryther's Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) program has been highlighted by The Seattle Times for its innovative and compassionate efforts to assist youth facing substance use challenges. The feature, titled "Against Fentanyl's Deadly Odds," showcases the MAT team's creative strategies to engage with young individuals in diverse environments, including streets and shelters, guiding them toward recovery and stability. The MAT program is a vital component of Ryther's extensive behavioral health care continuum, which includes services such as Partial Hospitalization Programs (PHP) and Wraparound Intensive Services (WISe), as well as outpatient therapy. Ryther is committed to providing support wherever children need it, whether in therapy settings, schools, or the community. During the holiday season, Ryther encourages support through donations, emphasizing the impact of contributions on expanding programs like MAT and offering life-changing services to children and families in need. The organization aims to continue delivering hope and healing, ensuring a brighter future for the youth they serve.
