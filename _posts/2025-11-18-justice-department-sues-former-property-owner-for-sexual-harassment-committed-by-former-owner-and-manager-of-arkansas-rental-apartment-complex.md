The Justice Department has filed a lawsuit against Thomas Ray Kelso, the former owner and manager of Briarwood Apartments in Searcy, Arkansas, for sexual harassment and retaliation against female tenants, violating the Fair Housing Act. The lawsuit also names Avatar Investments LLC, the property owner during the alleged misconduct. The complaint asserts that Kelso harassed tenants from 2001 until his arrest in 2023 and subsequent conviction for federal sex trafficking in 2025. Allegations include making unwelcome sexual comments, unwanted physical contact, offering reduced or free rent for sexual favors, and retaliating against those who rejected his advances by threatening essential services like electricity and laundry access. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon emphasized that no one should endure such harassment while seeking housing. U.S. Attorney Jonathan D. Ross stated that Kelso's actions exploited vulnerable victims and highlighted the need for accountability from both him and the property management company. The lawsuit seeks monetary damages for victims, civil penalties, and a court order to prevent future discrimination. This action is part of the Justice Department's ongoing Sexual Harassment in Housing Initiative, which has led to 51 lawsuits and approximately $16.2 million recovered for victims since its inception in 2017.
