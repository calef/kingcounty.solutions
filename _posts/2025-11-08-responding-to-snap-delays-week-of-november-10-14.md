Due to delays in the processing of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, families may experience challenges in accessing food assistance from Nov. 10 to Nov. 14. Households expecting their benefits during this period are encouraged to plan accordingly, as the delays could affect their ability to purchase groceries.

FamilyWorks is actively responding to these delays by offering additional support to those in need. They will provide food assistance through their food bank, which is open for clients facing difficulties. Families can visit the food bank to receive essential food items during this time.

Community members are also encouraged to reach out for assistance if they are struggling due to these delays. FamilyWorks emphasizes the importance of community support and urges individuals to inform others who may be affected by the SNAP delays. The organization remains committed to helping families navigate this challenging situation and ensuring they have access to necessary resources.
