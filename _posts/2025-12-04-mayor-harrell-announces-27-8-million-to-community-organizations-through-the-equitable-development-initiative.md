Mayor Bruce Harrell announced the allocation of $27.8 million to community organizations through Seattle's Equitable Development Initiative (EDI). This funding aims to support projects that promote community-driven development, racial equity, and economic opportunity for marginalized communities. The EDI focuses on addressing displacement and ensuring that the benefits of development reach historically underserved populations.

The initiative will fund a variety of projects, including affordable housing, public spaces, and small business support. Harrell emphasized the importance of community engagement in the decision-making process, stating that local organizations are best positioned to identify needs and implement solutions.

The funding is part of a broader effort by the city to foster equitable growth and combat systemic inequities. This latest round of funding reflects the city's commitment to investing in community-led initiatives that empower residents and enhance quality of life. The mayor also highlighted the collaborative approach taken with community stakeholders to determine funding priorities, ensuring that resources are allocated where they are most needed. This investment is viewed as a crucial step toward building a more inclusive and equitable Seattle.
