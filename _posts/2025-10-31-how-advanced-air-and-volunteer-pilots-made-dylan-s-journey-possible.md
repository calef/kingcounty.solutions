Dylan, a nine-year-old, experienced severe migraines and numbness, prompting his mother, Vanessa, to take him to the emergency room. After ten hours of tests, a CT scan revealed an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in his brain. Following this diagnosis, Dylan was airlifted to UCSF for further treatment. The medical team opted for Gamma Knife radiation instead of surgery, and after a week, he was discharged to await treatment.

With the assistance of a UCSF social worker, Vanessa arranged for round-trip flights through Angel Flight West (AFW). On their first flight, AFW Command Pilot Henry Ward and his son co-pilot, Austin, provided a supportive experience that eased the family's worries. After an overnight stay, Dylan underwent successful treatment at UCSF, which targeted the AVM effectively.

For the return flight home, Advanced Air generously donated their services. The pilots demonstrated exceptional care for the family, making the journey memorable. Today, Dylan is recovering well, and Vanessa expresses her gratitude for the support they received, emphasizing that the experience significantly impacted their family and alleviated the financial burden of their medical journey.
