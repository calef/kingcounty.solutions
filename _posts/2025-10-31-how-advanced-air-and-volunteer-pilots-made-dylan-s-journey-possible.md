  <p>Dylan was only nine years old when he complained of having a migraine and numbness in his legs. Knowing migraines are unusual for Dylan, his mom Vanessa took him to the emergency room, where their scary medical journey began. “That was the beginning of ten hours at the ER, watching Dylan in and out of consciousness,” says Vanessa.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>After hours of tests and blood work, a pediatrician quickly attuned to Dylan’s symptoms. <strong>A CT scan showed early arteriovenous malformation, or AVM, which is a type of brain abnormality.</strong> “The first thing that comes to my mind is brain surgery, and I’m internally collapsing at this point,” says Vanessa.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p><strong>Dylan was quickly airlifted from Crescent City, California to UCSF, where a team of doctors explained AVM to the family. </strong>Dylan’s care team developed a solid plan, deciding to move forward with Gamma Knife radiation versus invasive surgery. And after a weeklong stay at UCSF, Dylan was discharged to await his upcoming treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p><strong>Having discussed Angel Flight West’s services with a UCSF social worker, Vanessa confirmed their round-trip angel flights a week before Dylan’s treatment. </strong>The day of their first flight, AFW Command Pilot Henry Ward brought along his son and co-pilot, Austin. “It was like stepping into another world,” says Vanessa. <strong>“They took away our sense of worry and made us feel like we were doing something together as a team.”</strong>&nbsp;</p>

Dylan, a nine-year-old, experienced severe migraines and numbness, prompting his mother, Vanessa, to take him to the emergency room. After ten hours of tests, a CT scan revealed an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in his brain. Following this diagnosis, Dylan was airlifted to UCSF for further treatment. The medical team opted for Gamma Knife radiation instead of surgery, and after a week, he was discharged to await treatment.

With the assistance of a UCSF social worker, Vanessa arranged for round-trip flights through Angel Flight West (AFW). On their first flight, AFW Command Pilot Henry Ward and his son co-pilot, Austin, provided a supportive experience that eased the family's worries. After an overnight stay, Dylan underwent successful treatment at UCSF, which targeted the AVM effectively.

For the return flight home, Advanced Air generously donated their services. The pilots demonstrated exceptional care for the family, making the journey memorable. Today, Dylan is recovering well, and Vanessa expresses her gratitude for the support they received, emphasizing that the experience significantly impacted their family and alleviated the financial burden of their medical journey.
