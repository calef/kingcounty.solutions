On November 17, 2025, the Justice Department announced the denaturalization of Marieva Briceno, who defrauded Medicare of over $5.4 million while concealing her criminal activities to obtain U.S. citizenship. Briceno, originally from Venezuela, owned three medical clinics in Detroit that paid Medicare recipients for unnecessary tests and procedures. From May 2007 to January 2010, Briceno and her associates submitted approximately $5.46 million in fraudulent claims, resulting in Medicare payments of about $2.99 million, from which Briceno personally gained approximately $513,200.

Briceno applied for U.S. citizenship on December 21, 2009, and during her application process and subsequent interview, she concealed her health care fraud and denied any criminal conduct. She received her citizenship on March 19, 2010. After being charged with health care fraud in 2011 and pleading guilty in 2012, she was sentenced to 60 months in prison. The Justice Department filed for her denaturalization on August 12, 2025, leading to the revocation of her citizenship by U.S. District Judge Darrin Gayles. This case was prosecuted by the Justice Department's Office of Immigration Litigation, along with other agencies.
