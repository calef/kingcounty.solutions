  Navigating the legal system in English can be difficult regardless of your preferred language. Maybe you know there are laws that relate to your situation, or resources that might help, but you do not have any idea of how to access them, where to start, or what specifically you need. You’re not alone! If you’re struggling to navigate the legal system because of a language barrier, 211 is here to help you.

  When you call 211, you have the option of getting a translator for the call in the language you are most comfortable speaking in; **<u>all you have to do is say the name of the language and you will be put on hold while a translator is identified</u>**. Once a translator has been added to the call, one of our 211 information and referral specialists can help you figure out which resources will help you.

  _What do I need to do before I call 211?_

  - **Try to identify your legal goals and what resources might be helpful to you.** 211 cannot give legal advice; our role is to connect you with further resources making us a great first place to reach out to. Understanding the scope of our line can help you get the most out of your call.
  - **Have relevant information and answers ready so you can help us understand your situation and what you are looking for.** It is helpful for us to know if you are working with an attorney or have contacted one about what you are calling to address.
    - Income can be helpful to know, but is not required—there are resources to support you if you have no income.

  - **Reach out early!** Legal processes take time. If you have a 30-day eviction notice or summons, contact us as soon as you can so we have enough time to help you get the support you need.

  _I am a recent immigrant/am seeking asylum, are there resources for me?_

  There are a lot of helpful resources and programs supporting recent immigrants and those seeking asylum–- **<u>please reach out to 211</u>**! We can give you information about work permits, direct benefits and more.

  Before you call, think about what things you need to do now that you are here and how we can help support you, and share that information with us. A lot of what you are looking for likely has legal relevance.

  _I want to research on my own, but it is hard to know what is credible._

  [Search.Wa211.org](https://search.wa211.org/) will connect you with an online database of verified and credible resources near you! You can also check boxes on the side of the search bar to indicate what language you need the languages to be accessible in.

  _What can I expect after I call 211?_

  Once you have been referred to organizations and resources that will support you, it might take some time to make progress. Legal processes take time, and organizations sometimes take a while to reach out.

  While we cannot provide emergency _legal_ services, if you need immediate assistance, please reach out to 911 or 988, both open 24/7 via call and text.

  It can be really overwhelming to deal with laws that are new to you or inaccessible to you; we want to support you and make the process a little easier. You are not alone!
