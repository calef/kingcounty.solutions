Foreclosure prevention through mediation is a valuable yet underutilized resource for homeowners experiencing financial difficulties. The Dispute Resolution Center of King County (KCDRC) offers mediation services to help residents manage discussions with lenders, resolve misunderstandings, and explore alternatives to foreclosure. This service is complemented by the HOMES program, which assists older adults, veterans, and individuals with disabilities in applying for property tax exemptions in King County. Mediation is a voluntary and confidential process facilitated by trained mediators who guide conversations between homeowners and mortgage servicers, family members, and county officials without taking sides or providing legal advice. It aims to clarify situations, identify possible solutions, connect homeowners with support resources, and alleviate emotional strain. Common outcomes of mediation include new repayment timelines, coordination of property tax exemption documentation, and referrals to housing counselors or attorneys. Early engagement in mediation increases the likelihood of finding viable options. Homeowners at risk of foreclosure are encouraged to seek assistance through HOMES workshops, request mediation sessions, or participate in Information Hub meetings to access housing resources.
