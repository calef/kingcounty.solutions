Neighborhood House will host a celebration on October 7, 2025, to rename its Rainier Vista building as The Wilcox Center. This event honors Shirley and Louis Wilcox for their significant contributions to the community and acknowledges the ongoing efforts of Neighborhood House volunteers. The Wilcox Center will serve as a hub for Head Start and Early Head Start classrooms, caregiver support groups, resource navigation, and community spaces, reflecting the Wilcoxes' commitment to service, education, and equity.

Community leaders, elected officials, staff, and friends of the Wilcoxes will attend, with remarks from Executive Director Janice Deguchi and other community members. Shirley Wilcox made history in 1954 as the first Black President of the Neighborhood House Board of Directors, guiding the organization through transformative growth. Together with her husband Louis, a respected music teacher and volunteer, the Wilcoxes dedicated their lives to enhancing community service and equity, leaving a legacy that continues to inspire Neighborhood House today. The event will feature the unveiling of the new building name, a community celebration, and historic photos of the Wilcoxes.
