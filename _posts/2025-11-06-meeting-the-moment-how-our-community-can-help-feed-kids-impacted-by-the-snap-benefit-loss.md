In King County, over 100,000 households faced potential loss of SNAP benefits due to a federal government shutdown, leaving many families in uncertainty about their food support. While the state has temporarily funded SNAP for November, the need for ongoing assistance remains critical as families navigate rising food costs and tight budgets. Boys & Girls Clubs of King County are mobilizing their Rapid Response Fund to provide nourishment for children, recognizing that hunger affects not just health but also learning and emotional well-being. The fund aims to double meal and snack offerings, distribute non-perishable groceries, and expand hot meal services, particularly during Thanksgiving. With food banks experiencing record demand, community support is essential to ensure children have consistent access to meals. Ways to help include donating to the Rapid Response Fund, volunteering, and contributing non-perishable food items at designated Club hubs from November 7 to 21. Last year, the Boys & Girls Clubs served over 30,000 meals and nearly 347,000 snacks, reflecting their commitment to combating food insecurity among youth.
