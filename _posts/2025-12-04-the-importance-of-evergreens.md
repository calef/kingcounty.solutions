The City of Burien is planning to conduct a comprehensive review of its existing zoning code to ensure it aligns with current community values and supports the city's goals. This initiative aims to address housing, economic development, and environmental sustainability. The review process will involve public engagement, allowing residents to provide input on zoning issues that affect them.

As part of this effort, the city will hold community workshops and meetings to gather feedback and educate residents about zoning regulations. The goal is to create a zoning code that promotes a vibrant, inclusive community while also being responsive to the needs of residents and businesses.

The city emphasizes that the updated zoning code will be designed to facilitate the development of affordable housing options, support local businesses, and enhance the overall quality of life in Burien. The timeline for the zoning code review is set to ensure thorough analysis and community involvement, with results expected to be integrated into future planning efforts. Residents are encouraged to participate actively in the process to ensure their voices are heard and considered in shaping the future of Burien.
