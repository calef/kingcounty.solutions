Join Karina on December 11, 2025, for an Intuitive Art Workshop that encourages an unconventional and intuitive approach to art making and self-expression. Participants will explore a variety of mixed-media materials, including ink, pastel, and collage, to discover new techniques that ignite creativity and embrace imperfection. The workshop focuses on playful creation using text, abstract shapes, and layering, allowing attendees to tap into a deeper level of creativity and expression. RSVPs are required for this free event.
