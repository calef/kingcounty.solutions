Four California residents have been sentenced to prison for their involvement in a $16 million Medicare fraud and money laundering scheme through sham hospice companies. Juan Carlos Esparza, 33, received a 57-month sentence and was ordered to pay over $1.8 million in restitution. Susanna Harutyunyan, 39, was sentenced to 15 months and must pay nearly $2.8 million. Karpis Srapyan, 35, and Mihran Panosyan, 47, both received 57-month sentences, with restitution amounts of over $3.2 million and $4.6 million, respectively. Petros Fichidzhyan, 44, was sentenced to 12 years and over $17 million in restitution.

Between July 2019 and January 2023, the defendants operated four fraudulent hospices, including House of Angels Hospice, billing Medicare for unnecessary services. They used foreign nationals' identities to establish straw ownership and access banking services. The fraudulent proceeds were laundered through various means, including shell companies and bogus identification documents.

All defendants pleaded guilty to various charges related to health care fraud and money laundering. The scheme resulted in significant financial losses to Medicare, and efforts are ongoing to recover the fraudulent proceeds.
