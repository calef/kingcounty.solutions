Ruthia He, founder and CEO of the digital health company Done, and David Brody, its clinical president, were convicted by a federal jury in San Francisco for their involvement in a $100 million scheme to illegally distribute Adderall and commit health care fraud. They targeted individuals seeking drugs online, engaged in deceptive marketing, and prioritized profits over patient care, resulting in significant harm, including addiction and overdose among clients.

The defendants were found to have built a business model that facilitated easy access to over 40 million Adderall pills through subscription fees, while employing aggressive and misleading advertising strategies. They also submitted fraudulent claims to insurers, leading to over $14 million in reimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid.

During the trial, evidence revealed that He and Brody discouraged proper clinical practices and obstructed justice by moving operations overseas and destroying incriminating evidence. Both were convicted of multiple counts, including conspiracy to distribute controlled substances and health care fraud, and face up to 20 years in prison. Sentencing is scheduled for February 2026, as the case highlights significant abuses within telehealth practices.
