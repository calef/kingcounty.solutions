  their body.”&nbsp;**\n\n### A discussion with Donna Lurie&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nA Discussion
  with Donna Lurie on the importance of Mental Health within the Workplace\n\nBy:
  Ebrunur Chifchi, Angela Chong, Fartun Dirif, Tony Ha, Drilon Veliu, McKayla Vu\n\n&nbsp;\n\n_In
  a Zoom room full of black screens, Donna Lurie,_ [_NAMI Eastside_](https://nami-eastside.org/)
  _board member, employment law attorney, and owner of_ [_Lurie Workplace Solutions_](https://www.luriesolutions.com/)_,
  suddenly pops into view because her other meeting ran late. Her short, curly hair
  is neatly in place and her light blue eyes are shining behind her spectacles. She
  is wearing a blue houndstooth jacket over a matching blue shirt, appearing cool,
  poised, and collected. After explaining she is an arbitrator and mediator, she proceeds
  to explain the difference between the two, speaking very clearly in a professional,
  confident demeanor and enunciating her words carefully so that everyone can understand
  her. She changes her background from a blurred room to a blue NAMI background that
  shows the words “#notalone.”_\n\n&nbsp;\n\n_After the introduction, there is some
  initial confusion among the interviewers, the professor, and Donna when the professor
  mutes herself to talk to a towing company due to car troubles. Donna responds graciously,
  expressing that life happens and that we all need to understand and have grace when
  things pop up in life. She patiently waits and continues to maintain her cool, calm
  manner. As the Zoom interview progresses, she becomes slightly more animated with
  enthusiasm and passion as she dives into deeper topics.&nbsp;&nbsp;_\n\n&nbsp;\n\n_She
  explores mental health through NAMI, her own personal experiences, and family-related
  matters. She recalls her first interactions with mental health with her grandfather
  and WWII veteran father, who suffered from depression and post-traumatic stress
  disorder. Donna eventually followed her husband to the Pacific Northwest. After
  experiencing constant gloomy, overcast weather, she discovered she herself has a
  mental health condition called seasonal affective disorder. SADS is a form of depression
  that affects more than 20 percent of the population in the Pacific Northwest. She
  establishes the importance of communication and having proper resources regarding
  mental health, as the stigma can lead to individuals quietly suffering with their
  mental health conditions without seeking help, especially in the workplace.&nbsp;_\n\n-
  **Tell us more about your background and what are some of your personal experiences
  with mental health that led you to work with NAMI Eastside.**\n\n- **DL:** “…I grew
  up in a family where my dad was a veteran. He was on the front lines in World War
  2. He was in the D-day invasion and he fought hand-to-hand combat across France
  and Germany. He did not know how to deal with post-traumatic stress. At the time
  I was growing up, they didn’t even know what that was. He exhibited that simmering
  rage, and was very, very jumpy if there were any loud noises..&nbsp;\n- So now I
  know, from learning from NAMI what post traumatic stress is, and I realize that
  my dad suffered somewhat from that. I also had a grandfather who had depression
  and the family didn’t know how to deal with it. There was a lot of stigma – the
  family was very ashamed and didn’t want to talk about it. There was no NAMI back
  then…\n- I have a daughter who is a mental health therapist and she was a summer
  intern for NAMI Eastside. I got involved with NAMI Eastside because they needed
  help with some events and some activities, and then they needed a new staff handbook,
  and they asked me to help them write it since I have a labor and employment law
  background. I got more and more involved with NAMI as I saw the value of the programs
  and the support groups and the education classes that they offer. I had worked with
  several employees in my former career who suffered from mental health conditions
  and didn’t have resources.”\n\n**What support systems are available to veterans?
  And what are ways in which veterans can seek help through either NAMI Eastside or
  their networks?**\n\n**DL:** “I’m going to list 3 ways. First, NAMI has a program
  called [Homefront](https://www.nami.org/support-education/mental-health-education/nami-homefront/).
  I am actually a trained instructor in that program. It is a program for the families
  of veterans and active military service members to be more supportive and to better
  understand what veterans and active duty members are going through in transitioning
  from military life to civilian life. Nami Eastside has people trained in [Homefront](https://www.nami.org/support-education/mental-health-education/nami-homefront/)
  who can deliver that program. Secondly, there is a King County Veterans Affairs
  Office. Thirdly, there is a State Washington State Veterans Affairs office that
  is very active and has a number of resources for individuals, as well as families,
  who are dealing with either PTSD or other issues connected to military service.”&nbsp;\n\n**What
  are some common misconceptions about mental health within the workplace that you
  often encounter? And how do you address them?**\n\n**DL:** “Some of the misconceptions
  are that mental health is simply just a state of mind, and you need to ‘snap out
  of it’. That’s one assumption. Another is that it really isn’t any kind of disease,
  and therefore, it’s all in your head, so to speak. The other is the opposite of:
  Gosh! If you have a mental health condition, then you’re incapacitated, and you
  can’t do anything. So that’s the other extreme. The other misconceptions are that
  people can’t manage it, and people can. People don’t realize that sometimes there
  are triggers that make it harder for someone to manage their condition…So that’s
  where, again, doing some accommodation in the workplace can help everybody be the
  most productive and the most successful.”&nbsp;\n\n**How do you address those issues
  or misconceptions, and even accommodations? What would you do if that is happening
  in the workfield?**\n\n**DL:** “…the way to address it is through education and
  communication. People now spend more time talking about mental health than they
  did before. People are recognizing that when people come to work they don’t just
  come with their body. They come with their brains and their heads, and they bring
  their mental health and their physical health to the workplace. So it’s recognizing
  that both are important, and both need to be addressed.”&nbsp;\n\n**Besides communication
  that you mentioned earlier in the interview, what is the best advice you would give
  companies to make the workplace overall better for each employee?**\n\n**DL:** “Make
  it acceptable to discuss mental health because people are still unsure whether or
  not to even raise the issue, and then how to raise it appropriately. You don’t want
  to have an employee come in and use their team meeting as a therapy session – that
  would be inappropriate. But to say, I’m having a tough time because my dog died,
  or I’m having a tough time because I’m trying to figure out what to do with my parent
  who is ill and need to be moved into an assisted care facility. Those kinds of experiences
  are distressing. Carrying on and hoping somebody notices you’re not doing well is
  not a good way to communicate. So making it safe and making it appropriate for people
  to do some sharing, not over sharing, but some sharing at work…&nbsp;\n\nSecondly,
  to make sure that people have resources, that it’s not just the employee assistance
  program. People should know where the community resources are. People should have
  what we call [mental health first aid](https://www.thenationalcouncil.org/our-work/mental-health-first-aid/).
  NAMI Eastside has trainers to provide this program. People&nbsp; learn how to be
  better at recognizing if somebody has a mental health condition and how to help
  steer them to some resources…That is a skill and an awareness that would be very
  helpful in the workplace.”&nbsp;\n\n**Since you are an attorney, what kind of legal
  issues or cases have you seen between the employer and employee involving mental
  health?**\n\n**DL:** “There are lots of issues. Number one: Human resource staff
  and managers have to be careful that they don’t diagnose someone as a layperson.You
  have to look at people’s behaviors and determine whether or not they are impacting
  their ability to work in that workplace or be able to work with other colleagues.
  The manager or the colleagues need to refer the person to appropriate resources
  who can provide a diagnosis and possible treatment..&nbsp;\n\nOnce there is a diagnosis,
  let’s say, of [depression](https://www.nami.org/about-mental-illness/mental-health-conditions/depression/),
  [anxiety](https://www.nami.org/about-mental-illness/mental-health-conditions/anxiety-disorders/),
  [bipolar](https://www.nami.org/about-mental-illness/mental-health-conditions/bipolar-disorder/),
  etc. It is the employer’s responsibility to make reasonable accommodations for that
  person to be able to continue to perform the essential functions of the job. It’s
  also helpful, and I’ve done this in mediation, for a team to understand how best
  to communicate with each other…you have to look at what each person needs in terms
  of communication.&nbsp;\n\n…Make sure that people don’t label each other and make
  assumptions…that means that you cannot have a workplace that labels people and says
  ‘We don’t want anyone who has a mental health condition.’ There can’t be exclusion,
  there can’t be labeling, there can’t be judgment – such as ‘Because you have this
  condition, you’re no longer welcome here.’”&nbsp;\n\n**What strategies can organizations
  implement to promote a culture of well being and support amongst employees?**\n\n**DL:**
  “Again, making sure that people know where the resources are for mental health,
  whether it’s NAMI or other organizations to be able to say to people, here are resources.
  If you want education, [support groups](https://nami-eastside.org/supportgroups/),
  referrals, resource networks, etc. Secondly, there needs to be some awareness on
  the company’s part or the organization’s part to say to people, here are some mental
  health podcasts that are available, here are software platforms where people can
  actually monitor and and manage their own mental health with their phones. There
  are so many tools available now.”&nbsp;\n\n**What do we change to make mental health
  a main priority in different jobs?**\n\n**DL:** “You have to have a support system.
  Very, very important, and that’s something we work on at NAMI Eastside. We make
  sure that people have a support system, either through support groups or just through
  volunteers, leaders, staff, that they have somebody to talk to and that they are
  in activities that give them some joy and give them some respite from whatever is
  causing them anxiety or distress.”&nbsp;\n\n_Through her insightful interview, Donna
  relays how she began her journey into advocating for mental health and shares the
  wisdom she has learned along the way. She clears misconceptions about mental health
  in the workplace that might exist among the public as well as the solutions to addressing
  these misconceptions.She emphasizes how crucial it is to ensure that each employee
  in any workplace can openly talk about their mental health struggles without fear
  of judgment and how employers and managers can provide and direct them to appropriate
  resources. Donna highlights how_ [_NAMI_](https://www.nami.org/) _is an excellent
  resource designated to help and support those with mental health conditions and
  promote mental well-being, including veterans and those in the workforce._ [_NAMI
  Eastside_](https://nami-eastside.org/) _would appreciate any_ [_volunteers_](https://nami-eastside.org/volunteer/)
  _and/or_ [_donations_](https://donatenamieastside.my.canva.site/) _that would contribute
  towards helping those struggling with mental health issues and towards funding programs
  that prioritize mental health._\n\n&nbsp;\n\n_This article is a collaborative piece
