The 1 Line extension will open on December 6, adding three new stations in Kent Des Moines, Star Lake, and Federal Way Downtown, enhancing connectivity in the region. Link trains operate from early morning to late at night, with schedules varying by station. The best way to pay for rides is with an ORCA card, available for $3 from ticket machines or through Google Wallet. Adult one-way fares are $3, with reduced fares for seniors, low-income riders, and people with disabilities. 

Transfers between transit services are seamless with the ORCA card, which works regionally with King County Metro, Pierce Transit, and others. Each new station is fully accessible, featuring elevators, level boarding, and large, clear signage. They also connect to various bus routes, making it easier to reach neighborhoods and job centers. Facilities include multi-level parking garages, bike racks, and paratransit bays.

To plan routes, the Sound Transit Trip Planner offers schedules and service alerts. Riders are encouraged to practice courtesy on trains, keep safety in mind, and report any issues to security. The extension aims to enhance commuting and exploration in South King County.
