  When Amber shared these words at our Fall Community Brunch, she captured not just her personal experience, but the heart of what we strive to be – a place of hope, belonging, and new beginnings. Her words remind us why we do what we do. Every day, we are inspired by the women we meet and serve – by their courage, their resilience, and their determination to rebuild their lives.

  Homelessness is more than the loss of a home. It wears you down, takes away your dignity and confidence, and crushes your dreams. We believe homelessness does not define you. Every woman who walks through our doors is seen, heard, and celebrated. We support healing through understanding and build confidence with compassion. We celebrate every small step forward and empower women to rewrite their own futures.

  Our biannual Community Brunches are a beautiful reflection of this spirit. Women who have been housed and those still on the journey come together to reconnect and enjoy the simple pleasures of being in community – good food, warm company, and a sense of belonging.

  The journey to stability is rarely a straight line. It can take time and many tries, but no woman walks that path alone. A powerful community surrounds her – you, our amazing, generous supporters, along with staff and case managers. Together, we advocate for an Eastside community where every woman has a home and is thriving.

  This work has never been more urgent. The challenges of the past months have deeply affected vulnerable communities – from women experiencing homelessness to those facing economic and food insecurity.

  Already this year, we have served and supported 290 women through our six programs. And we have proudly placed 39 keys on our mission board – each one symbolizes a woman beginning her journey toward stability.

  Our goal this year is simple: to help 150 women find a place to call home. We have faith – in our community, in every person who has given generously, and in the belief that [together, we can do more](https://sophiaway.org/donate/).

  **_Every woman who walks through our doors deserves the chance to begin again. To know that at The Sophia Way, like Amber said, she won’t just find a home. She’ll find a family!_**
