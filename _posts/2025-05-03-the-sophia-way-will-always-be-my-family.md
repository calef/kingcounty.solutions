*The Sophia Way*, an organization focused on supporting homeless women, aims to help 150 women find a home this year. The organization serves as a place of hope and new beginnings, striving to empower women to rebuild their lives. So far, they have served and supported 290 women through their six programs in 2021, and have helped 39 women begin their journey towards stability. The organization also hosts biannual Community Brunches, where housed women and those still on the journey can reconnect and enjoy a sense of community.
