King County Metro has achieved significant ridership growth, ranking second among the 10 largest transit agencies in the U.S. with an estimated 63 million boardings by Aug. 31. This marks an increase of 4.5 million boardings compared to the previous year. Notably, average weekday boardings rose across all time periods: 5,000 more in the morning, 6,600 more during midday, and 9,500 more in the afternoon. The RapidRide G Line has emerged as a key contributor, experiencing an 86% increase in average weekday boardings from 3,600 in September 2024 to 6,700 in September 2025, making it Metro’s 11th most frequently ridden route. This is the second consecutive year that Metro has been recognized as a leader in ridership growth, receiving accolades from the American Public Transportation Association. Looking ahead, the agency plans to enhance its services, with more than 400,000 additional hours of bus service proposed in the 2026-27 budget. Metro is committed to providing safe, reliable transit options and encouraging more residents to use public transportation.
