On August 19, coinciding with World Humanitarian Day, The DOVE Project will launch the inaugural Hope Lives Here Giving Day, a 24-hour campaign aimed at raising funds for survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault on Vashon Island. All donations will remain local, supporting crucial programs such as crisis intervention, trauma-informed mental health services, holistic wellness initiatives, and prevention programs aimed at stopping violence before it occurs. This event is framed not just as a fundraiser but as a community declaration that everyone deserves a safe home. Participants are encouraged to mark the date, donate online by 11:59 p.m., share the campaign with others, and invite at least three people to contribute. The initiative seeks to foster safety, dignity, and hope for all residents, aiming to make this first Giving Day a memorable step towards a brighter future for the community.
