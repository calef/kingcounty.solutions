  Happy fall, everyone!

  The King County Library System is rolling out all kinds of programs and learning opportunities in October, including voter information, author events and back-to-school assistance.

  First, an important heads-up for our patrons. This month, KCLS libraries will each close for one day for staff meetings. These meetings are scheduled on a rotating basis to provide staff members an opportunity to come together with their teammates for professional development and customer service training in support of KCLS strategic goals. In addition to system-wide training, each regional team will be able to spend time together working on local issues as identified by management so that all libraries will continue to be supportive community centered spaces. Find your local [library’s schedule](https://kcls.org/news/library-closures-for-staff-meetings-in-october/?utm_source=biblioemail-kcls&utm_medium=email#schedule) and more information on our website.

  KCLS, and public libraries in general, have always been sources of trustworthy, impartial information, with the belief that patrons can learn and make their own choices and decisions. The important General Election is coming up on November 5, and the Library System is offering programs to increase voter awareness and education.

  We are partnering with King County Elections for [Voting Rights & Registration Workshops](https://kcls.bibliocommons.com/v2/events?q=voting%20rights). Elections staff will provide a review on the significance of voting, who is eligible to vote, and how to cast ballots. The first workshops will be held October 2 at Fairwood Library and October 3 at Des Moines Library. Our [elections page](https://kcls.org/elections/) has more dates, times and information.

  Our partnership with King County Elections includes [ballot boxes](https://kcls.bibliocommons.com/v2/locations?facilities=5d3727f8a56ad5065153d754&_gl=1*ssplfj*_ga*MzIyNjUxMzgxLjE2OTAyMjAzNTU.*_ga_G99DMMNG39*MTY5NzY1NDUyOS41My4xLjE2OTc2NTQ4OTUuMC4wLjA.*_ga_87TS29R5HD*MTY5NzY1NDUzMC41Mi4xLjE2OTc2NTQ4OTUuMC4wLjA.*_ga_GSN8Q2NL99*MTY5NzY1NDUyOC41MS4xLjE2OTc2NTQ4OTQuMC4wLjA.*_ga_VP05GNK0XC*MTY5NzY1NDUyOC41MS4xLjE2OTc2NTQ4OTQuMC4wLjA.*_ga_QXTYXDVVNT*MTY5NzY1NDUyOC41MS4xLjE2OTc2NTQ4OTQuMC4wLjA.)&nbsp;at 24 libraries to make voting more convenient. For a complete list of ballot boxes throughout the county, visit the&nbsp;[King County Elections](https://kingcounty.gov/en/legacy/depts/elections/how-to-vote/ballots/returning-my-ballot/ballot-drop-boxes.aspx)&nbsp;website. Please remember to vote by 8pm November 5.

  KCLS takes civic engagement seriously, but also makes time for fun, too. Our patrons enjoy celebrations of all kinds, and because Hispanic/Latinx Heritage Month runs through October 15, KCLS is hosting Hispanic author events plus a [cultural celebration](https://kcls.bibliocommons.com/events/66b1177baefc8df4a11a0bc3) at Covington Library October 1. The bilingual program includes mariachi music, how to make a paper-bag pinata and a Spanish Story Time.

  KCLS is hosting other [author events](https://kcls.org/authorevents/) this fall as well, including a special October 15 program. [Patrick Flores-Scott](https://kcls.bibliocommons.com/events/66ba4b201be1968097df9249) will discuss writing, teaching and the role of books in kids’ lives. The 7pm talk will be held at Renton’s Carco Theater, as well as online. Tanisha Brandon-Felder, host of YouTube’s **_Talking Books with Tanisha!_** will moderate the discussion of Flores-Scott’s work, including his new young adult &nbsp;novel, **_No Going Back_** _._

  One of the Library System’s chief aims is to support literacy and learning in all forms, and our commitment is stronger than ever. KCLS’ robust [back-to-school](http://www.kcls.org/back-to-school) program reflects the many partnerships we have developed to bolster education for students, teachers, parents and caregivers. These include the popular K-12 [Study Zone](https://kcls.org/studyzone/), which offers a range of homework help and tutoring. Need help with math? Check out [Math Club](https://kcls.org/faq/homework-help/#math-club). Need someone to read to? Connect with [Reading Buddies](https://kcls.bibliocommons.com/v2/events?q=Reading%20Buddies) and [Reading with Rover](https://kcls.bibliocommons.com/v2/events?q=Reading%20with%20Rover). Talk Time offers a chance to practice English with other language learners in a supportive environment.

  KCLS also has strong collaborations with schools, ranging from student accounts to programs that encourage and support grade-school reading and learning. Our new [Career Online High School](https://kcls.org/resource/career-online-high-school/) offers students a chance to earn a high school diploma while developing career skills. Check [www.kcls.org/back-to-school](http://www.kcls.org/back-to-school) for free library resources.
