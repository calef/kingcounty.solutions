For Shirley Apeland, a knitted hat symbolizes warmth and kindness. After facing her own cancer treatment a decade ago, receiving a knitted hat helped her cope with the loss of her hair and reminded her that she was not alone. Inspired by this gesture and the care her granddaughter received in the NICU, Shirley began knitting six years ago and launched "Knitting for a Cause" with support from Church For All in Federal Way. This initiative brings together a group of ten women who create hats and baby booties for patients in the Birth Center, NICU, and Cancer Center. Each month, they gather for potluck dinners, sharing stories while crafting gifts that provide comfort and hope to those in need. Shirley emphasizes their motto, “We do our best to give our best,” reflecting their commitment to making recipients feel valued. She credits Annette Beltrand for her creativity and organizational skills, which have been vital to the project's success. Looking ahead, the group plans to include inspirational messages in their hats and create feeding tube pouches for patients. Their work is a heartfelt reminder that compassion can be stitched into every item they donate.
