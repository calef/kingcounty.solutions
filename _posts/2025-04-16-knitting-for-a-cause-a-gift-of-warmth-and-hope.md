  <p>For Shirley Apeland, a single knitted hat carried warmth far beyond its stitches. During her own cancer treatment 10 years ago, losing her hair was one of the hardest challenges she faced. But when she received a knitted hat, it wasn’t just about keeping warm—it was a gesture of kindness, a reminder that someone cared and understood. That act of generosity stayed with her, and in time, she felt called to do the same for others.</p>



  <p>A familiar face, Shirley spent 18 years working in both the Valley Family Medicine Clinic and the Health Information Management department before retiring to care for her granddaughter. But her connection to Valley never faded. Inspired by both her own cancer experience and the compassionate care her granddaughter received in Valley’s NICU, Shirley knew she wanted to give back.</p>



  <p>After learning to knit six years ago, Shirley started making and donating hats to organizations throughout our community. With the support of Church For All in Federal Way, she launched Knitting for a Cause last year, bringing together a group of 10 talented and generous women to multiply the impact—more hands, more hats, more hope. Our Birth Center &amp; NICU, and Cancer Center patients are proud recipients of these heartfelt gifts.</p>



  <p>Each month, the Knitting for a Cause group gets together to create beautiful, intricate hats and baby booties, while enjoying a potluck dinner and sharing stories. More than handmade gifts, the group offers comfort, dignity, and hope for those facing difficult times. “We do our best to give our best,” Shirley says, a motto that guides their work.</p>

  <p class="has-text-align-left">For Shirley and the group, it’s not just about making something—it’s about how it makes others feel. “A very&nbsp; important part of what we do is to give something good and for someone to feel good about receiving it,” she shares. That belief is stitched into every item her group donates, a tangible reminder that no one is alone.</p>

  <p>And, a labor of love like this doesn’t come together alone. Shirley credits Annette Beltrand, whose top-notch creativity and organizational skills were instrumental in getting the group off the ground. “I couldn’t do this important work without her,” she emphasizes. “Annette helped make it all possible!”</p>



  <p>The Knitting for a Cause group is already looking ahead, planning to sew inspirational messages into cancer patients’ hats and make feeding tube pouches for those in need.</p>



  <p>Shirley and Annette, we are incredibly grateful for you and your group’s generosity! Thank you for sharing your hearts and sparking hope for our Valley patients and families, one stitch at a time.</p>

For Shirley Apeland, a knitted hat symbolizes warmth and kindness. After facing her own cancer treatment a decade ago, receiving a knitted hat helped her cope with the loss of her hair and reminded her that she was not alone. Inspired by this gesture and the care her granddaughter received in the NICU, Shirley began knitting six years ago and launched "Knitting for a Cause" with support from Church For All in Federal Way. This initiative brings together a group of ten women who create hats and baby booties for patients in the Birth Center, NICU, and Cancer Center. Each month, they gather for potluck dinners, sharing stories while crafting gifts that provide comfort and hope to those in need. Shirley emphasizes their motto, “We do our best to give our best,” reflecting their commitment to making recipients feel valued. She credits Annette Beltrand for her creativity and organizational skills, which have been vital to the project's success. Looking ahead, the group plans to include inspirational messages in their hats and create feeding tube pouches for patients. Their work is a heartfelt reminder that compassion can be stitched into every item they donate.
