  <p>While national Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion efforts are being rolled back, Bike Works is rolling forward with clarity and purpose. Bike Works remains committed to our mission, our work, and our community — at a time when many social advancements are under challenge, our work remains the same. <strong>We hold anti-racism and racial equity at the core of our work, both internally and externally.</strong> We use the bicycle to build connections to people, to places, and to the self. <strong>We celebrate Black joy. We celebrate trans inclusion. </strong>We celebrate belonging for each and every body. We are all called to ground ourselves in community and to uplift and support those closest to us. This is the ethos at the core of everything we do at Bike Works. </p>



  <p>DEI in cycling means breaking down barriers to entry and ensuring that everyone—regardless of race, gender identity, or economic background—feels welcomed, supported, and safe in the cycling world. It means addressing the historical exclusion of BIPOC riders in competitive cycling, ensuring trans and non-binary cyclists have access to affirming spaces, and making sure affordable bikes and repair services are available to those who need them most. It means investing in infrastructure so that all communities—not just affluent ones—have access to safe bike lanes and trails.</p>



  <p>In light of&nbsp;all this, we are&nbsp;increasing&nbsp;our impact by investing over&nbsp;<strong>$450,000</strong>&nbsp;in a&nbsp;<strong>Youth Leadership Initiative</strong>&nbsp;and year-round bike education programming in South Seattle schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://bikeworks.org/donate/">You can join us on this journey by donating here.</a></p>

Bike Works is advancing its commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in cycling despite national setbacks. The organization emphasizes anti-racism and racial equity in its mission, celebrating Black joy and trans inclusion while fostering a welcoming environment for all. DEI efforts focus on dismantling barriers for underrepresented communities, ensuring safety and accessibility in cycling for individuals of all backgrounds.

In 2024, Bike Works is investing more than $450,000 into a Youth Leadership Initiative and year-round bike education in South Seattle schools, aiming to empower BIPOC youth through mentorship and hands-on cycling opportunities. The program will reach more than 500 students across four schools. Adult education initiatives are also expanding, targeting BIPOC individuals, women, and transgender people, with 65% of participants in the previous year identifying as part of these groups.

Community events such as Tour De Fleurs and celebrations honoring cycling pioneers are designed to strengthen connections among cyclists and promote inclusivity. In 2024, Bike Works aims to provide free or low-cost bikes to more than 554 individuals, deliver 3,500 hours of bike education, and recycle 5,000 bicycles, reinforcing its mission of social change through cycling.
