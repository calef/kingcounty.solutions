Bike Works is advancing its commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in cycling despite national setbacks. The organization emphasizes anti-racism and racial equity in its mission, celebrating Black joy and trans inclusion while fostering a welcoming environment for all. DEI efforts focus on dismantling barriers for underrepresented communities, ensuring safety and accessibility in cycling for individuals of all backgrounds. 

In 2024, Bike Works is investing over $450,000 into a Youth Leadership Initiative and year-round bike education in South Seattle schools, aiming to empower BIPOC youth through mentorship and hands-on cycling opportunities. The program will reach over 500 students across four schools. Adult education initiatives are also expanding, targeting BIPOC individuals, women, and trans folks, with 65% of participants in the previous year identifying as part of these groups. 

Community events such as Tour De Fleurs and celebrations honoring cycling pioneers are designed to strengthen connections among cyclists and promote inclusivity. In 2024, Bike Works aims to provide free or low-cost bikes to over 554 individuals, deliver 3,500 hours of bike education, and recycle 5,000 bicycles, reinforcing its mission of social change through cycling.
