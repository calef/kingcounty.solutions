  <h4><strong>The Legacy of Peer Mediation</strong></h4>
  <p>When KCDRC peer mediation programs came to an end, it marked not only the close of a chapter, but also the beginning of a new vision. For years, peer mediation gave youth the opportunity to practice leadership by resolving disputes, listening deeply, and building trust with their peers. Those experiences planted the idea that young people are not only capable of addressing conflict, but also uniquely positioned to lead their communities through change.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4><strong>A Spark Sharpened by Global Conflict</strong></h4>
  <p>The spark for KC CONNECT was already present, rooted in years of youth development and community dialogue. But earlier this year, as stories of conflict unfolded across the world, especially images of families being torn apart in Los Angeles during ICE raids, that spark was sharpened into a clear vision. These moments highlighted the urgency of preparing youth and families not only to manage everyday disputes, but also to process systemic injustice, heal together, and step into leadership. Out of this conviction the design for KC CONNECT grew.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4><strong>Building on Strong Foundations</strong></h4>
  <p>KC CONNECT builds on the legacy of peer mediation and the lessons from the Bridge pilot program in 2024. From those foundations came two important realizations: that conflict resolution belongs in the hands of everyone, not just trained mediators, and that healing-centered dialogue has the power to strengthen entire communities. Rather than limiting skills to a select group of student mediators, KC CONNECT opens access to youth and families across King County.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4><strong>How to Participate</strong></h4>
  <p>KC CONNECT offers two ways to participate. Schools, youth-serving nonprofits, and community groups can bring workshops directly into classrooms, after-school programs, youth groups, or family engagement settings, tailored in partnership with staff. For individuals, KCDRC also hosts free monthly online workshops open to all youth and families in King County. These sessions cover three tracks: Foundations of Conflict (roots, communication, emotion, and identity), Skill-Building (restorative practices, family circles, and digital conflict), and Critical Awareness &amp; Cultural Power (conflict as change, youth circles, reclaiming power). Together, these options make KC CONNECT both accessible and responsive to community needs.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4><strong>Centering Inclusivity and Equity</strong></h4>
  <p>As Sharon explains, the power of KC CONNECT lies in its inclusivity. Each participant leaves the workshop with practical tools for communication and problem-solving, but also with the experience of being heard and valued.<em><strong> “Everyone should have access to these skills,”</strong></em> she reflects. <em><strong>“Each person who takes part learns new ways to relate that help them solve their own problems, work with others, and join together as a community.”</strong></em></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4><strong>A Vision for Youth Leadership</strong></h4>
  <p>Fergie’s vision extends beyond workshops into a future leadership module. She has a passion for seeing young people step into civic spaces where their voices can influence change. Her hope is that KC CONNECT will inspire youth, especially those from communities historically excluded from decision-making, to apply for county and statewide advisory boards and to see themselves as leaders capable of shaping policy and community priorities. As she describes it, <em><strong>“It’s not just about a board seat, it’s about inspiring youth to know they have the power to make a difference, in whatever way they choose.”</strong></em></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4><strong>More Than a Program: A Movement</strong></h4>
  <p>This transformation aligns closely with the values of the Dispute Resolution Center. By centering healing, responsiveness to community needs, and equity, KC CONNECT ensures that conflict resolution is not just a tool for solving problems, but also a means of building stronger, more resilient communities. As Dave, Executive Director, observes, <em><strong>“This isn’t just a program, it’s a movement. We’re preparing kids to take over the world.”</strong></em></p>
  <p>KC CONNECT stands as more than a continuation of past work. It represents a shift in approach: from resolving conflicts one by one to equipping entire communities with the skills to heal, lead, and advocate for change. It is a program rooted in history, built for today, and preparing the leaders of tomorrow.</p>

KCDRC's KC CONNECT initiative builds on the legacy of peer mediation to empower youth and families across King County. The program aims to prepare young people to manage conflicts and lead their communities in response to systemic injustices. With a focus on inclusivity, KC CONNECT offers workshops tailored for schools, nonprofits, and community groups, ensuring that conflict resolution skills are accessible to all. 

Monthly online workshops are available, covering topics such as the foundations of conflict, skill-building in restorative practices, and critical awareness of cultural power. Participants leave equipped with practical tools for communication and problem-solving, fostering a sense of being heard and valued. The initiative also seeks to inspire youth, particularly from historically marginalized communities, to engage in civic leadership and policymaking. 

KC CONNECT is described as more than just a program; it represents a movement toward building resilient communities through healing-centered dialogue and collaborative conflict resolution, preparing the next generation of leaders to effect meaningful change.
