KCDRC's KC CONNECT initiative builds on the legacy of peer mediation to empower youth and families across King County. The program aims to prepare young people to manage conflicts and lead their communities in response to systemic injustices. With a focus on inclusivity, KC CONNECT offers workshops tailored for schools, nonprofits, and community groups, ensuring that conflict resolution skills are accessible to all. Monthly online workshops are available, covering topics such as the foundations of conflict, skill-building in restorative practices, and critical awareness of cultural power. Participants leave equipped with practical tools for communication and problem-solving, fostering a sense of being heard and valued. The initiative also seeks to inspire youth, particularly from historically marginalized communities, to engage in civic leadership and policy-making. KC CONNECT is described as more than just a program; it represents a movement towards building resilient communities through healing-centered dialogue and collaborative conflict resolution, preparing the next generation of leaders to effect meaningful change.
