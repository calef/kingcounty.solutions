  Not Linked to Autism '

The West Coast Health Alliance reaffirms its strong support for vaccination as a crucial measure to protect children's health, emphasizing that extensive research involving millions of individuals globally demonstrates no link between vaccines and autism. The Alliance expresses concern over misleading claims recently made on the CDC website, which could confuse families seeking accurate information. Autism is described as a complex neurodevelopmental condition influenced by various genetic and environmental factors, and attributing it to a single cause, like vaccination, is misleading. This misinformation not only hinders families' understanding of vaccines but also poses risks to autistic individuals and their families. Vaccines undergo rigorous testing and are essential for preventing infectious diseases. The Alliance stresses the importance of evidence-based public health guidance on immunization and encourages families to consult trusted healthcare providers and reputable medical organizations, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, for accurate information.
