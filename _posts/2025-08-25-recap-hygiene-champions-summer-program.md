This summer, a group of middle and high school students known as the Hygiene Champions organized a community fundraiser to support Essentials First’s mission of providing access to basic hygiene essentials. Over several weeks, these students demonstrated strong leadership through various teams: the Operations Team managed logistics and activities; the Food & Decor Team set up the event space and hosted a bake sale; the Marketing Team created promotional materials; the Fundraising Team led hygiene drives and engaged local businesses; and the Entertainment Team coordinated performances and activities.

The program culminated in a successful fundraising event on August 2nd, raising over $75,000. Gratitude was expressed towards donors, Essentials First staff, parent volunteers, and partners such as the Together Center and the Rotary Club of Woodinville, which sponsored a Dessert Dash. Washington State Representative Osman Salahuddin also contributed a motivational message. The Hygiene Champions were recognized for their creativity, passion, and commitment, showcasing the potential of youth leadership in addressing hygiene poverty in the community.
