  This summer, our Hygiene Champions, a group of amazing middle and high school students, stepped up to lead a community fundraiser supporting Essentials First’s mission, ensuring everyone has access to basic hygiene essentials with dignity&nbsp;

  Over several weeks, these youth took charge through team-based leadership:

  - **Operations Team** &nbsp;handled event logistics, signage, setting up the welcome table, and ran the Kahoot game!&nbsp;

  - **Food & Decor Team** &nbsp;They set up the event space, designed the decor, and ran a fun bake sale.

  - **Marketing Team** &nbsp;designed flyers, promoted the event, and managed outreach.

  - **Fundraising Team** &nbsp;led hygiene drives, made brochures and pledge forms, and engaged stores and neighbors to collect supplies.

  - **Entertainment Team** &nbsp;curated stage fun, coordinated performances, and kept the energy high!

  The program culminated with a fundraising event on August 2nd, where this group of youth pulled off a fun and educational afternoon and raised over $75,000 to support the mission of Essentials First!

  We have so much gratitude to share -- to the donors whose generosity will echo through our communities empowering dignity for thousands of neighbors; to Essentials First Programs & Operations Manager Marryam Ali for coordinating the program and to the parent volunteers and EF staff who helped bring the vision to life; to our partners at the [**Together Center**](https://www.facebook.com/togethercenter? __cft__ [0]=AZUevT52ugNMLptNn71NldNpo6q5dTBI3AGqhBdUvkIFFU_mEKrcneYdA8tYzOND6g9TIVxQ1yOI0YRyfpJDHeTd5_PQniKc20Hyo9eukS6NUGTc-QnZvrgKPXaGp_IGZah6yll6GzOvSGURhmkAmt7zwGGXaWab87em8WAMUCpXKIMNktr_9EG1rU4VQ9BAW-8& __tn__ =-]K-R) for hosting and the [**Rotary Club of Woodinville**](https://www.facebook.com/RotaryClubofWoodinville? __cft__ [0]=AZUevT52ugNMLptNn71NldNpo6q5dTBI3AGqhBdUvkIFFU_mEKrcneYdA8tYzOND6g9TIVxQ1yOI0YRyfpJDHeTd5_PQniKc20Hyo9eukS6NUGTc-QnZvrgKPXaGp_IGZah6yll6GzOvSGURhmkAmt7zwGGXaWab87em8WAMUCpXKIMNktr_9EG1rU4VQ9BAW-8& __tn__ =-]K-R) for sponsoring and pulling off a memorable Dessert Dash; to [**Washington State Representative Osman Salahuddin**](https://housedemocrats.wa.gov/salahuddin/)for sharing a powerful message and example to the youth; and to the Sheriff family for their ongoing stewardship of this movement to end hygiene poverty for good.

This summer, a group of middle and high school students known as the Hygiene Champions organized a community fundraiser to support Essentials First’s mission of providing access to basic hygiene essentials. Over several weeks, these students demonstrated strong leadership through various teams: the Operations Team managed logistics and activities; the Food and Decor Team set up the event space and hosted a bake sale; the Marketing Team created promotional materials; the Fundraising Team led hygiene drives and engaged local businesses; and the Entertainment Team coordinated performances and activities.

The program culminated in a successful fundraising event on Aug. 2, raising more than $75,000. Gratitude was expressed toward donors, Essentials First staff, parent volunteers, and partners such as the Together Center and the Rotary Club of Woodinville, which sponsored a Dessert Dash. Washington State Representative Osman Salahuddin also contributed a motivational message. The Hygiene Champions were recognized for their creativity, passion, and commitment, showcasing the potential of youth leadership in addressing hygiene poverty in the community.
