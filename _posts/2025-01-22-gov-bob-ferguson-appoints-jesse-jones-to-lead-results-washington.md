  _Jesse Jones appointed director of Results Washington_

  **OLYMPIA** – Gov. Bob Ferguson announced today he has appointed former journalist Jesse Jones as director of Results Washington, the agency responsible for making government work better for Washingtonians. Results Washington helps state agencies improve performance by establishing measurable goals, collecting performance data and conducting regular public performance reviews.

  In his inaugural address last week, Ferguson committed to improve customer service across state government. He said, “Few things frustrate me more than bureaucracy that creates delays, confusion, or extra hurdles when people and businesses need questions answered and results delivered. … Our mission must be to speed up government, improve customer service and center the people in every decision we make.”&nbsp;

  To that end, Jones will refocus Results Washington on customer service, using its resources and expertise to help agencies deliver the highest level of service and meeting the needs of Washingtonians.

  Jones, an award-winning consumer investigative reporter, is nationally recognized for results-driven journalism that sparked change at the local, state and federal levels for more than three decades. His reports on curbing ticket bots, campaigning for free credit freezes and exposing real estate companies that locked homeowners into decades-long sales contracts helped change Washington state law.

  “Washingtonians know that when there is a problem to be solved, you get Jesse,” Ferguson said. “Government must work better. Jesse’s track record makes him an ideal candidate for this role.”&nbsp;&nbsp;

  Jones earned multiple Emmy awards for his reporting and was a member of a team that was a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize in 2024. He was chosen to represent the 2024 class of the Northwest Chapter of National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Silver Circle Award.

  Raised in Tacoma, Jones graduated from Henry Foss High School and started his TV career as an intern at Tacoma-based KSTW-TV.

  In 2007, Jones launched the “Get Jesse” consumer investigative segment on KING 5. “Get Jesse” helped Washingtonians take on bad businesses and contractors, leading to numerous local, state and federal investigations.

  In 2014, Jones moved to KIRO-TV, where his “Jesse Jones” segment included nationally recognized investigations that led to change from Main Street all the way to the corridors of power in Washington D.C. and exposed Fortune 500 companies. One report about Office Depot running a questionable computer repair program led to an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission and the Washington State Attorney General.

  More recently, Jones’ investigation revealed a hidden 3% charge on certain concessions at Climate Pledge Arena. That work led to a class action lawsuit and subsequent action by the state Attorney General’s Office.

  Jones currently lives in Snohomish County with Kim, his wife of 34 years. His daughter, Cydney, attends college in Colorado.
