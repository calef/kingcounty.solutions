The City Council is seeking applicants for a vacancy on Bellevue's Arts Commission, with a deadline for online applications set for May 23. The commission advises the council on arts-related matters, aiming to enhance the city's cultural landscape and promote awareness of the arts within the community. It oversees the Public Art Program, allocates funds to local arts organizations, and supports cultural planning initiatives. Monthly meetings occur on the first Wednesday at 4:30 p.m. Commissioners are volunteers appointed by the mayor, serving four-year terms, and all applicants must be Bellevue residents. The city encourages applications from individuals of diverse backgrounds. Applications are available online, and paper copies can be obtained at several city locations, including the City Clerk’s Office and local libraries. Completed applications can be submitted in person, via mail, or by email. For further information about the commission's roles and responsibilities, interested parties can contact Arts Program assistant Manette Stamm.
