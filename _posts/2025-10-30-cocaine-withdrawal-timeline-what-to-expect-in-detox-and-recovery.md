Cocaine withdrawal can vary significantly among individuals, but it typically follows a general timeline. Initial symptoms may begin within hours of last use and can last for several days. During the first week, symptoms such as intense cravings, fatigue, and irritability are common. By the end of the first week, many experience improvements, but psychological symptoms like anxiety and depression may persist. 

After two weeks, physical symptoms often diminish, yet emotional and psychological challenges may continue. By the end of a month, most physical withdrawal symptoms resolve, but cravings and emotional difficulties may linger. Long-term recovery can take several months to years, with some individuals experiencing occasional cravings. 

Support from healthcare providers, counseling, and support groups can be beneficial during the detox and recovery process. It is crucial for individuals to seek professional help to manage withdrawal symptoms effectively and to increase the likelihood of a successful recovery. Understanding the timeline of withdrawal can help prepare individuals and their loved ones for what to expect during this challenging period.
