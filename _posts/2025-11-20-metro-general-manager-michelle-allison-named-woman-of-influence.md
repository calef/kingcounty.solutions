King County Metro General Manager Michelle Allison received the Woman of Influence award from the Puget Sound Business Journal in recognition of her impactful leadership and commitment to community transformation in the region’s transit system. This accolade was presented at a Seattle ceremony, highlighting her role as only the second woman to lead Metro. Under her guidance, Metro has achieved significant ridership growth, delivering over 300,000 rides daily and enhancing civic engagement and economic momentum in the area.

Allison is leading the largest transit expansion in the U.S., focusing on improved services, including expanded evening and weekend options, and the upcoming Federal Way Link light rail extension. A commitment to sustainability is evident as Metro progresses towards a zero-emissions future, with 15% of its buses now battery electric. Her policies ensure equitable access to transit, including reduced fares and free rides for youth.

Allison has prioritized safety enhancements and staff development, mentoring new operators and supporting leadership programs. Her extensive background in public service, communications, and community engagement complements her educational qualifications in communications and public administration, making her a pivotal figure in shaping the future of transit leadership.
