Spring sports season brings various transit options for fans attending games in Seattle. Fans can use Link light rail, Sounder trains, and buses to reach venues like Lumen Field and Climate Pledge Arena. It's advisable to plan ahead, expect crowds, and use an ORCA card or the Transit Go Ticket app for convenience. Event trains and additional routes are available, making it easy to explore Seattle. Fans under 18 ride free, and arriving early or leaving later can help avoid congestion. Safety tips include staying off yellow lines and being mindful of others on platforms.
