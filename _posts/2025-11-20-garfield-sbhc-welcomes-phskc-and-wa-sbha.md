On November 20, the Garfield School-Based Health Center (SBHC) team, representing the Odessa Brown Children’s Clinic and Seattle Children’s Hospital, hosted members from Public Health–Seattle & King County and the Washington School-Based Health Alliance. The visit highlighted the effective collaboration between the SBHC and the school nurse in facilitating vaccine access. Attendees appreciated the clinic's newly refurbished facilities and the introduction of a gender care supply locker. The SBHC team expressed gratitude for the warm reception and the opportunity to showcase their clinic's resources and efforts in supporting student health.
