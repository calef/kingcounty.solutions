Seattle Parks and Recreation has launched the Park CommUNITY Fund Workshop series to promote park equity through community-led funding. This initiative, supported by the Seattle Park District, will provide resources for various capital projects from 2023 to 2028. The workshops aim to empower communities by enhancing their involvement in the funding process. The series includes several sessions: 

- **Dec. 4**: An online overview of the fund's process and updates from the first cycle.
- **Dec. 18**: An in-person workshop on park development, teaching participants how projects are initiated and how to engage in the process.
- **Jan. 22**: A session focused on community organizing to advocate for desired park investments.
- **Feb. 5**: A collaborative meeting to refine the Park CommUNITY Fund process for the upcoming cycle.

Participants will reflect on past cycles, co-create improvements to the funding process, and build skills for future advocacy. The series aims to unite community partners and park advocates to further park equity goals and encourage participation in the 2026 project selection cycle. Interested individuals are encouraged to attend one or all workshops to enhance their application skills.
