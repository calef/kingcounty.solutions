Inviting young families and adults in their 20s, 30s, and 40s, St. Luke’s will kick off a new program year on September 7 from 5-7 PM with a dinner and childcare. This event will allow attendees to connect over a meal and discuss future gatherings. Starting September 7, weekly Children's Formation will also resume during the first half of worship, beginning at 10 AM in classroom 5. Children will rejoin the congregation at the Peace for the Kids’ Word, with no set age range for participation. The program aims to explore the elements of worship and engage children in the church experience. Childcare will be available in classroom 3 until the Peace and Kids’ Word, accommodating feedback from families about comfort levels for visitors. The 20s/30s/40s group will serve as a gathering space for parents and families, with plans for more events that include childcare and foster discussions on faith and life. The kickoff event will allow for community building and input on future activities. Families are encouraged to provide feedback and share their hopes for the upcoming program year.
