Beginning March 9, Hope United Methodist Church will hold its worship service at 10:30 AM at the former First UMC of Bellevue building. This marks the church's first gathering as Hope UMC and the start of Lent, themed "Cultivating and Letting Go." Lent is described as a season of spiritual gardening, where congregants are invited to allow God to reveal what aspects of their lives need nurturing or releasing for new life to flourish. Each week, the service will present stories and images that reflect themes of earthiness and grit, encouraging exploration of what needs to be tended and what should be let go. For the first Sunday in Lent, the focus will be on cultivating resilience and letting go of feelings of powerlessness.
