CAMFED has been named a beneficiary of The New York Times Communities Fund for the third consecutive year, with donations up to $500,000 being matched. As the only international organization selected among this year's nonprofits, CAMFED is recognized for its grassroots model that helps girls in rural Africa gain access to education and leadership opportunities. Education is deemed a crucial investment for the future, yet many girls, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, are still excluded from schooling. Statistics show that only 5 out of 100 girls from families in extreme poverty complete secondary school. The support from The New York Times Communities Fund aims to change these outcomes and empower more girls through education. The Communities Fund, which has raised over $354 million since its inception, will also support six other charities this year. CAMFED's CEO, Angeline Murimirwa, emphasizes the importance of taking action today to create a better future for girls. The organization's efforts are further highlighted by recent accolades, including a government award in Malawi recognizing CAMFED as the best NGO for girls' education.
