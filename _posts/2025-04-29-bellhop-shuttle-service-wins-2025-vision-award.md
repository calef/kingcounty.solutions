BellHop, a free shuttle service in Bellevue, has been awarded the 2025 Transportation Vision Award by the Seattle and Bellevue 2030 Districts. Launched in 2023, BellHop has quickly become an essential part of the city's urban mobility, providing nearly 115,000 rides to over 150,000 passengers and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by over 100 metric tons. The program, funded through hotel room fees and partner support, features all-electric point-to-point shuttles that make transportation accessible and sustainable.

Mayor Lynne Robinson highlighted BellHop's role in enhancing mobility and supporting the city’s environmental goals, while Brad Jones, executive director of Visit Bellevue, emphasized its importance in connecting visitors, residents, and workers to various city destinations. The service aids in navigating the first and last mile of travel, with grocery stores being among the top destinations. BellHop's recognition aligns with the Seattle 2030 District's mission to lessen the environmental impact of urban transportation, showcasing innovation in sustainable travel. Three new full-size Kia electric vehicles were recently added to the fleet, further enhancing the service's capacity.
