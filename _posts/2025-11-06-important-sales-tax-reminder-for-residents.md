title: Important Sales Tax Reminder for Residents
topics: []
---

Yarrow Point residents are reminded that the town receives a small percentage of sales tax from goods and services delivered to the town. Each time a Yarrow Point address is used for delivery, 1.1% of the 10.3% sales tax paid is passed to the town as unrestricted revenue. This includes purchases made during the holiday season and throughout the year. For example, if a $1,000 iPhone is delivered to Yarrow Point instead of Bellevue, the town receives the $11 city sales tax. Residents are urged to override auto-filled city names during purchases to ensure the revenue goes to Yarrow Point instead of another city.
