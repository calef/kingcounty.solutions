  <p>-Institutional ableism: While disabled individuals do receive benefits that enable them to cover expenses and bills while they are unable to work, there is a drawback to receiving SS benefits: disabled individuals must limit their savings to no more than $2,000 or risk losing their benefits.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>-Systematic ableism: Schools are often designed to do the “one size fits all” method, and it can present challenges for neurodivergent students, like ADHD.

  <p>Young people with disabilities often face ableism in schools, which can hold back their learning and social growth. As they get older, these challenges continue, affecting their chances for jobs and promotions in big organizations.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Older people with disabilities also deal with ageism on top of ableism, which can keep them from joining in important decisions in these organizations.&nbsp;</p>

Ableism pervades society, as the world is largely designed without consideration for people with disabilities. It stems from the belief that disabled individuals need to be "fixed" and often reduces them to their disabilities. Various forms of ableism exist: 

- **Interpersonal Ableism** occurs when a parent seeks to "cure" their disabled child instead of accepting them.
- **Societal Ableism** is exemplified by casting non-disabled actors in roles meant for disabled characters.
- **Institutional Ableism** includes the limitations imposed on disabled individuals receiving Social Security benefits, which restrict their savings to $2,000.
- **Systematic Ableism** affects neurodivergent students, like those with ADHD, who struggle in traditional educational settings that do not accommodate their needs.

Ableism creates an unsafe environment for people with disabilities in various organizations, resulting in inaccessible spaces, discriminatory attitudes, and policies that overlook their requirements. Young individuals with disabilities often encounter barriers in education that impede their learning and social development, while older individuals face compounded challenges of ageism alongside ableism, limiting their participation in key decisions within organizations.
