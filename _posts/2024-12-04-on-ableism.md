Ableism pervades society, as the world is largely designed without consideration for people with disabilities. It stems from the belief that disabled individuals need to be "fixed" and often reduces them to their disabilities. Various forms of ableism exist: 

- **Interpersonal Ableism** occurs when a parent seeks to "cure" their disabled child instead of accepting them.
- **Societal Ableism** is exemplified by casting non-disabled actors in roles meant for disabled characters.
- **Institutional Ableism** includes the limitations imposed on disabled individuals receiving Social Security benefits, which restrict their savings to $2,000.
- **Systematic Ableism** affects neurodivergent students, like those with ADHD, who struggle in traditional educational settings that do not accommodate their needs.

Ableism creates an unsafe environment for people with disabilities in various organizations, resulting in inaccessible spaces, discriminatory attitudes, and policies that overlook their requirements. Young individuals with disabilities often encounter barriers in education that impede their learning and social development, while older individuals face compounded challenges of ageism alongside ableism, limiting their participation in key decisions within organizations.
