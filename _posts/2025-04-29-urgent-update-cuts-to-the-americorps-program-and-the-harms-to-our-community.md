  For Immediate Release

  Tuesday, April 29

  This weekend, all six of HIP’s AmeriCorps folks were terminated or put on unpaid leave by DOGE and the Trump administration. On Friday, United Way announced the Trump administration terminated two of our AmeriCorps, Zahraa (our volunteer coordinator) and Cameron (our Afterschool Meals lead). Late in the afternoon yesterday, our WSC AmeriCorps (Alyssa, Aidyn, Charlotte, and Amariah) found out via email that they were to stop service immediately and be put on unpaid leave for the foreseeable future. They likely will not be paid for their service yesterday. HIP was told to stop hiring for our Summer Meals HungerCorps this year and next year’s WSC cohort and rescind all extended AmeriCorps position offers.

  For many reasons, this decision left us in utter shock. While we were trying to figure out how to best take care of Zahraa, Cameron, Alyssa, Aidyn, Charlotte, and Amariah, all they could think about was our program participants. Some even offered to come in for free to help our programs, because they know how much our students, seniors, and neighbors depend on HIP’s meals. Without them, homebound seniors can’t receive their meals. Without them, students cannot receive Healthy HIP Packs or Afterschool Meals.

  We at HIP are heartbroken. Our programs have taken a hit. Half of our close friends and colleagues are gone. Our communities will suffer greatly as a consequence of this decision. Everyone who volunteers at HIP knows how essential our AmeriCorps members are. They are the best this country has to offer, and this country has let them down.

  Here are some ways you can help in this hour of unprecedented need:

  **1. Volunteer** –We need volunteers now more than ever. Each of our programs is going to require more volunteers and time. [Sign up for a packing party](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20F0B4CA8AB22A4F85-hipvolunteering#/). Sign up for a [prep](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20F0B4CA8AB22A4F85-senior#/) or [serving](https://www.signupgenius.com/go/20F0B4CA8AB22A4F85-senior2#/) shift. Most importantly, sign up to be a volunteer driver. Without a designated delivery meals coordinator, our homebound seniors cannot receive meals unless someone volunteers for a volunteer route. We will also need volunteers for Summer.

  **2. Send Job Opportunities** –Our AmeriCorps folks were let go without any warning and the rent is due.

We encourage you to reach out to your elected reps to express your concern for the cuts to these crucial programs (especially [Rep Jayapal](https://jayapal.house.gov/contact/email/); [Sen Murray](https://www.murray.senate.gov/write-to-patty/); [Sen Cantwell](https://www.cantwell.senate.gov/contact/email/form)).

This weekend, all six AmeriCorps members at Hunger Intervention Program (HIP) were terminated or placed on unpaid leave due to cuts initiated by the Trump administration. The abrupt decision has left the organization in shock, as it now faces significant challenges in providing essential services to the community. Without these members, vital programs such as meal deliveries for homebound seniors and afterschool meals for students are at risk. HIP is calling for immediate community support, urging individuals to volunteer for various roles, particularly as meal delivery drivers. They are also seeking job opportunities for the former AmeriCorps members, who were let go without warning. Advocacy efforts are encouraged, with a focus on contacting local, state, and federal representatives to express concerns about the impact of these cuts. Additionally, HIP is accepting donations to help sustain their programs and potentially rehire staff. The organization expresses deep sadness over the loss of their team and emphasizes the critical need for community engagement to continue serving vulnerable populations. Updates on the situation and its effects on programs will be provided in the coming days.
