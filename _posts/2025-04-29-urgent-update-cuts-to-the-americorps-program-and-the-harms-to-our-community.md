This weekend, all six AmeriCorps members at Hunger Intervention Program (HIP) were terminated or placed on unpaid leave due to cuts initiated by the Trump administration. The abrupt decision has left the organization in shock, as it now faces significant challenges in providing essential services to the community. Without these members, vital programs such as meal deliveries for homebound seniors and afterschool meals for students are at risk. HIP is calling for immediate community support, urging individuals to volunteer for various roles, particularly as meal delivery drivers. They are also seeking job opportunities for the former AmeriCorps members, who were let go without warning. Advocacy efforts are encouraged, with a focus on contacting local, state, and federal representatives to express concerns about the impact of these cuts. Additionally, HIP is accepting donations to help sustain their programs and potentially rehire staff. The organization expresses deep sadness over the loss of their team and emphasizes the critical need for community engagement to continue serving vulnerable populations. Updates on the situation and its effects on programs will be provided in the coming days.
