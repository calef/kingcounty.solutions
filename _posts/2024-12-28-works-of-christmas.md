  <p class="has-text-align-center"><br>“When the song of the angels is stilled, When the star in the sky is gone, When the kings and princes are home, When the shepherds are back with their flock, The work of Christmas begins: To find the lost, To heal the broken, To feed the hungry, To release the prisoner, To rebuild the nations, To bring peace among others, To make music in the heart.” -Howard Thurman</p>





  <p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>



  <p>Christmastide is the season between Christmas and Ephiphany, the 12 days of Christmas. During this time, we remember that the Work of Christmas is just beginning anew as we reflect on the hope that comes with the birth of Christ on earth and remember that Christ taught us to care for the poor, free the oppressed, and to love God and neighbor. Each day, you are provided with an opportunity to study and reflect on the work of some of our partner organizations related to our priority areas as a faith community.

Christmastide, the season between Christmas and Epiphany, emphasizes the ongoing "Work of Christmas" inspired by Howard Thurman's words. This period invites reflection on the hope brought by Christ's birth, encouraging actions to care for the marginalized. Each day from December 25 to January 5, the First Church highlights various partner organizations, focusing on community service and advocacy.

Activities include volunteering at the Shared Breakfast Program, supporting the Washington Immigrant Solidarity Network, and engaging with Mending Wings to empower Native youth. Environmental justice initiatives through Earth Ministry and furniture restoration with the Furniture Repair Bank are also emphasized. Additionally, opportunities to assist during disaster recovery with Early Response Teams and to volunteer at Food Lifeline are provided.

The Faith Action Network promotes interfaith advocacy, while Neighborhood House addresses family needs in low-income communities. The Reconciling Ministries Network calls for LGBTQ+ inclusion, and the General Board of Church & Society focuses on justice work. Lastly, the General Commission on Religion & Race encourages discussions on racism and privilege through various community engagements. Each day presents a chance to act and make a positive impact, reinforcing the message of love and service central to the Christmas spirit.
