Christmastide, the season between Christmas and Epiphany, emphasizes the ongoing "Work of Christmas" inspired by Howard Thurman's words. This period invites reflection on the hope brought by Christ's birth, encouraging actions to care for the marginalized. Each day from December 25 to January 5, the First Church highlights various partner organizations, focusing on community service and advocacy.

Activities include volunteering at the Shared Breakfast Program, supporting the Washington Immigrant Solidarity Network, and engaging with Mending Wings to empower Native youth. Environmental justice initiatives through Earth Ministry and furniture restoration with the Furniture Repair Bank are also emphasized. Additionally, opportunities to assist during disaster recovery with Early Response Teams and to volunteer at Food Lifeline are provided.

The Faith Action Network promotes interfaith advocacy, while Neighborhood House addresses family needs in low-income communities. The Reconciling Ministries Network calls for LGBTQ+ inclusion, and the General Board of Church & Society focuses on justice work. Lastly, the General Commission on Religion & Race encourages discussions on racism and privilege through various community engagements. Each day presents a chance to act and make a positive impact, reinforcing the message of love and service central to the Christmas spirit.
