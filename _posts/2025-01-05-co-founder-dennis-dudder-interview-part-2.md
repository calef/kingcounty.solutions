Co-founder Dennis Dudder reflects on nearly 30 years of involvement with Changes in a recent interview. He observes that issues surrounding youth behavior have remained consistent since the 1970s, particularly regarding a Washington state law that allowed 13-year-olds in divorce situations to decide their living arrangements. This law inadvertently led to many young people living on the streets, a problem that persists today. Dudder has been actively involved in various roles at Changes, including serving on the Board of Directors and as a representative for the Everett meeting. He highlights the importance of grant writing in the organization's early days, collaborating with fellow founders to secure funding for their initiatives. Dudder also expresses his enjoyment in conducting orientations for new members. When asked about the longevity of Changes, Dudder admits that the founders initially only committed to three or four years, unaware of the organization's potential growth. Over the years, Changes expanded its reach, establishing multiple groups throughout Washington state, although some have since disbanded as needs changed.
