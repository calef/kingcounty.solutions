Medicare's Annual Enrollment Period is set to begin on October 15 and will run until December 7. With significant changes expected in 2026 due to the Inflation Reduction Act, it's crucial for beneficiaries to feel secure in their decisions. To assist with this, GoldenCare is offering two free Medicare sales seminars aimed at addressing common questions. These seminars will cover topics such as new updates for 2026, considerations for selecting a plan, and when changes can be made. The seminars are scheduled for October 30 at 1 PM and November 21 at 11 AM, taking place at Valley Medical Center's Medical Arts Center in Renton, WA. They will be led by Paul Gunther, a licensed insurance agent who specializes in Medicare. Attendees can enjoy light refreshments and are encouraged to RSVP to ensure their participation in this important enrollment season.
