  <p><em>$275,000 invested since 2008 enhances accessibility and independence for Veterans and individuals</em></p>



  <p>Compass Housing Alliance&#8217;s Shoreline Veterans Center (SVC), which provides dignified housing for dozens of Veterans who have formerly experienced homelessness, continues to thrive thanks to a transformative partnership with the Employees Community Fund of Boeing (ECF). The collaboration has enabled critical accessibility upgrades and enrichment projects that are dramatically improving residents&#8217; quality of life and independence.</p>



  <p>Since 2008, the ECF has committed more than $275,000 in funding for various projects across Compass Housing Alliance programs, including the Cascade Women&#8217;s Program, Renton Veterans Center, Nyer Urness House, and the Karlstrom Apartments. At the Shoreline Veterans Center specifically, ECF funding has supported pathway enhancements to Veteran-run garden beds, accessibility upgrades to doors and grounds, new kitchen flooring, and the installation of a wheelchair lift in the community van.</p>



  <p>&#8220;Working with the ECF has been fantastic,&#8221; said Shree Vigil, longtime program manager at SVC. &#8220;They are easy to work with, and they understand the needs that Veterans like those who live with us here at SVC have. When we have a need, they step up.&#8221;</p>

Compass Housing Alliance’s Shoreline Veterans Center (SVC) enhances the lives of Veterans through a partnership with the Employees Community Fund of Boeing (ECF), which has invested over $275,000 since 2008. This collaboration has facilitated vital accessibility improvements, including upgrades to garden pathways, door access, kitchen flooring, and the installation of a wheelchair lift in the community van. Program manager Shree Vigil highlights the ECF's understanding of Veterans' needs and their responsiveness to requests.

Residents, such as James, have experienced significant changes; the van lift has granted him newfound independence, allowing him to travel independently. Another resident, Joe, finds joy in gardening, a passion rekindled by the improved accessibility to garden beds. He expresses that gardening gives him a sense of home and purpose.

The ECF, which pools donations from Boeing employees, funds various nonprofit organizations, celebrating its 75th anniversary in 2024 and donating $5.7 million to charities nationwide last year. Vigil emphasizes the importance of organizations like the ECF in improving the daily lives of residents at SVC, looking forward to future collaborations.
