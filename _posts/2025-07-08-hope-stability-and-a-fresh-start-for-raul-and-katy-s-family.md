title: Hope, stability, and a fresh start for Raul and Katy’s family
topics:
- Shelter & Housing
- Financial Assistance
- Employment & Job Support

After being evicted from a shared home in Bellevue, Raul, Katy, and their two children faced homelessness, sleeping in their car. While Raul worked to support the family, Katy struggled to find employment without a permanent address. Their situation improved when a community partner referred them to Bellevue LifeSpring. At the Bellevue Family Hub, the team quickly helped them by providing low-income housing options and connecting them with a landlord. They received emergency assistance to cover move-in costs, which removed a major financial barrier to securing long-term housing. The family successfully moved into a new apartment, and a motel stay was arranged for them to avoid sleeping in their car during the transition. With their housing secured, their children began attending school, Raul continued working, and Katy pursued new job opportunities. This story reflects a broader issue in Bellevue, where many families face housing insecurity and job instability simultaneously. Community support is crucial in helping families like Raul and Katy's overcome these challenges and break the cycle of poverty.
