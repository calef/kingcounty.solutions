As winter approaches, it is essential to focus on nourishing foods that can enhance immunity and overall health. Key nutrients that support immune function include vitamin D, vitamin C, and zinc. 

Vitamin D, crucial for bone health and immune response, is often deficient in many individuals, particularly among people of color. Sun exposure is recommended for vitamin D synthesis, along with dietary sources like oily fish, fortified products, and eggs. 

Vitamin C acts as an antioxidant, supports collagen production, and can shorten the duration of colds. It is abundant in fruits and vegetables such as citrus fruits, strawberries, and peppers. 

Zinc plays a vital role in growth, metabolism, and immune function. While its supplementation may not significantly reduce cold symptoms, it can decrease the duration of illness. Common dietary sources of zinc include beef, chickpeas, lentils, and nuts. 

Incorporating recipes rich in these nutrients can help maintain a robust immune system during the cold season.
