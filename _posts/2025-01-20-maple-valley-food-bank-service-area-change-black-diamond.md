title: Maple Valley Food Bank Service Area Change (Black Diamond)
topics:
- Food & Nutrition
- Financial Assistance
---

Maple Valley Food Bank has announced a change in its service area, effective February 1, 2025. The entire City of Black Diamond will no longer be included in the service area, meaning residents outside the Tahoma School District will lose access to additional programs such as Rent/Mortgage Assistance, Holiday Gifts, Holiday Food, and School Supplies. This decision, made by the Maple Valley Food Bank Board of Directors, was influenced by the availability of other food banks serving Black Diamond, specifically Plateau Outreach Ministries and the Black Diamond Community Center.

Plateau Outreach Ministries offers food assistance on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, while the Black Diamond Community Center Food Pantry is open on Mondays and Wednesdays. Despite the service area change, the Maple Valley Food Bank remains committed to helping anyone in need during its Market Hours on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, ensuring that no one will be turned away for food. The Executive Director, Jon Cantalini, expressed appreciation for the understanding of the community regarding this change and apologized for any inconvenience caused.
