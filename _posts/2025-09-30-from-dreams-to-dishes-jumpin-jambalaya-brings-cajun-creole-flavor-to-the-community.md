Youpa's journey embodies the mission of Neighborhood House, which aims to provide tools and support for individuals to create brighter futures. Initially seeking stability through the Economic Security for All (EcSA) program and its Matched Investment Savings Account (MISA), Youpa was able to secure stable housing for herself and her daughter. This stability allowed her to pursue her dream of sharing her cultural flavors through food, resulting in the establishment of her restaurant, Jumpin Jambalaya. The restaurant features bold Cajun and Creole cuisine and serves the Seattle, Renton, and Kent communities. Youpa's passion for cooking is evident in the dishes she creates, which reflect her resilience and joy. As Jumpin Jambalaya flourished, Youpa committed to giving back by hiring from Neighborhood House's employment programs, emphasizing her dedication to her community. Her business is not just a source of income but a means to honor her roots and inspire others on similar paths. Youpa frequently expresses gratitude for the support she received, highlighting the importance of community in achieving success. Neighborhood House celebrates her accomplishments and the positive impact she has made.
