Valley Cities Enumclaw is launching wellness-focused programs and services for 2025 to enhance the physical, mental, and emotional well-being of its clients. As part of 'Welcome Back Week' from January 8 to 10, the clinic introduced new group services, including mindfulness sessions, 'Therapeutic Thursday' coping skills workshops, and a weekly line dancing group. Clinic manager Ashley D. Lesley emphasizes a holistic approach to wellness, aiming to help clients connect with all aspects of their health. Expanding youth services is a priority, with plans to revive popular summer programs for 2025 and enhance in-school offerings to improve access to care. Valley Cities provides a range of youth and family services, addressing emotional and behavioral challenges for children aged 5 and up, including individual and family therapy, group sessions, and peer support for caregivers. The organization invites community support through donations to sustain and expand its services across King County. Those in need of mental health or addiction assistance can contact Valley Cities directly or reach out to their 24-hour crisis line.
