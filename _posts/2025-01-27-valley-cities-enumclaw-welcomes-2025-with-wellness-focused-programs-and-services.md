Clinic manager Ashley D. Lesley emphasizes a holistic approach to wellness, aiming to help clients connect with all aspects of their health. Expanding youth services is a priority, with plans to revive popular summer programs for 2025 and enhance in-school offerings to improve access to care. Valley Cities provides a range of youth and family services, addressing emotional and behavioral challenges for children aged 5 and up, including individual and family therapy, group sessions, and peer support for caregivers.
