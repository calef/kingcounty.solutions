The Justice Department has announced significant progress from its six-month initiative, Operation Not Forgotten, aimed at investigating violent crimes in Indian Country, particularly those involving missing and murdered Indigenous persons. The FBI deployed 64 personnel across ten field offices, collaborating with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Tribal law enforcement. This operation marked the most extensive national deployment of FBI resources to address such crimes.

During this period, over 330 investigations were supported, leading to 1,260 individuals charged, 1,123 arrests, and the recovery of 304 weapons. Notable cases include the indictment of three individuals in a 2020 New Mexico murder and multiple charges against others for serious violent crimes.

Operation Not Forgotten has previously addressed over 760 cases, resulting in numerous arrests and convictions. The initiative reflects ongoing commitments to tackle persistent levels of violent crime in Indian Country, where approximately 4,300 investigations remain open, including serious cases of domestic violence and child abuse. The Department plans to enhance these efforts through its Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons Regional Outreach Program, which aims to improve responses to these critical issues.
