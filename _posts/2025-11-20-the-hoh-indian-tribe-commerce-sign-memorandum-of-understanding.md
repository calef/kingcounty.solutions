The Hoh Indian Tribe and the Washington State Department of Commerce have signed a historic memorandum of understanding (MOU) establishing government-to-government relations. This agreement aims to remove administrative barriers, enhance communication, and implement culturally appropriate data privacy and security measures. Signed by Hoh Tribal Chairwoman Darlene Hollum and Commerce Director Joe Nguyễn, the MOU reflects a commitment to respect and collaboration, as well as the sovereignty of the Hoh Tribe. As the Tribe relocates its village to higher ground for safety, this partnership ensures their voices are heard. 

The Hoh Tribe, located at the mouth of the Hoh River on Washington’s Olympic Peninsula, is known for its cultural resilience and environmental stewardship. The Tribe has ancestral ties to the land and has preserved traditional practices such as fishing and storytelling. The Tribe signed the Treaty of Olympia in 1856, affirming its rights to fish, hunt, and gather. The MOU marks the eleventh such agreement between Commerce and tribal governments, with plans for more agreements by 2026. Commerce is focused on improving funding processes and strengthening partnerships with tribal nations in Washington.
