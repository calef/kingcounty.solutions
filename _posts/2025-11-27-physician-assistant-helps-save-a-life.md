A physician assistant at the VA hospital in Richmond, Virginia, played a crucial role in saving a life during a recent emergency situation. While attending a routine staff meeting, the physician assistant noticed a colleague in distress. The colleague had suddenly collapsed, prompting immediate action. The physician assistant assessed the situation and began performing CPR while other staff members called for help and retrieved an automated external defibrillator (AED). 

Thanks to the swift response and teamwork of the staff, the colleague was stabilized and transported to the hospital for further treatment. The incident highlights the importance of emergency preparedness and teamwork in healthcare settings. The physician assistant emphasized the significance of staying calm and acting quickly in emergencies.
