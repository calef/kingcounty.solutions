title: Protect child support payments to families on TANF - NO on HB 2039
topics:
- Financial Assistance
- Childcare
---

Irene Muller, Director of Advocacy & Outreach for Essentials First, testified before the WA House Appropriations Committee on April 4, 2025, urging members to reject HB 2039. She highlighted the struggles of low-income families relying on TANF grants, which provide only 8-11% of the Needs Standard, leaving no room for essential hygiene expenses. Muller, a single mother with personal experience of poverty, emphasized the urgent need for justice for families facing financial difficulties. She noted that the rising costs of raising children are outpacing existing support systems, causing more families to fall through the cracks. Muller called for the protection of child support funds to ensure families receive the financial assistance they need to overcome poverty and thrive. She suggested that instead of limiting resources, the state should consider implementing progressive revenue measures to address budget deficits.
