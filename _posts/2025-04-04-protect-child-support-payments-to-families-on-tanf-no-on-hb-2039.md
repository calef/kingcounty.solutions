  _Testimony given before WA House Appropriations Committee by Essentials First Director of Advocacy & Outreach on Friday April 4, 2025_

  To the members of the Appropriations committee and everyone gathered here today, thank you for the opportunity to speak in this critical moment.

  My name is Irene Muller, currently serving as the Director of Advocacy & Outreach for Essentials First, an organization that combats hygiene poverty in Washington by distributing essential goods like soap and laundry detergent to families in need.

  Our clients are low-income families, many of whom rely on TANF grants to meet their basic needs. These grant amounts are so low, typically only 8-11% of the Needs Standard, that there is no flexibility to cover hygiene expenses alongside the many other critical needs these grants are meant to support.

  We see firsthand every day the impact of limiting the financial resources of Washington families.

  I am also a single mother with lived experience of poverty and it’s many consequent struggles.

  I am here today because you have a rare opportunity before you: to achieve some justice swiftly and decisively for a huge number of families facing poverty at once.&nbsp;

  The cost of raising children is skyrocketing, and the constellation of policies and organizations designed to provide a reliable foundation for parents are not keeping up - more families fall through the cracks every day.&nbsp;

  Please&nbsp;ensure&nbsp;that&nbsp;families receive the child support funds that rightly belong to them, that they need to survive and make their way out of poverty, so we can continue moving toward a future where all families thrive.&nbsp;To fill our deficit, I urge you to rely on passing progressive revenue instead.

  Thank you.

Irene Muller, director of advocacy and outreach for Essentials First, testified before the Washington House Appropriations Committee on April 4, 2025, urging members to reject HB 2039. She highlighted the struggles of low-income families relying on TANF grants, which provide only 8-11% of the needs standard, leaving no room for essential hygiene expenses. Muller, a single mother with personal experience of poverty, emphasized the urgent need for justice for families facing financial difficulties. She noted that the rising costs of raising children are outpacing existing support systems, causing more families to fall through the cracks. Muller called for the protection of child support funds to ensure families receive the financial assistance they need to overcome poverty and thrive. She suggested that instead of limiting resources, the state should consider implementing progressive revenue measures to address budget deficits.
