The Washington Smile Survey 2023–2024 is a collaborative effort involving the Washington State Department of Health, the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction, local health jurisdictions, and oral health professionals, supported by the Arcora Foundation. Conducted every five years, this survey provides an in-depth analysis of children's oral health in Washington. 

The Smile Survey Dashboard offers users the ability to access and analyze the latest survey data. It includes state and county snapshots that highlight significant trends and changes since the last survey in 2015-16. Users can compare findings across different demographic groups within counties or between counties to identify populations needing oral health assistance. Additionally, the dashboard features a self-service table view for quick access to specific data points and a county profile view designed for easy printing. Feedback from users is encouraged through a dedicated feedback form, enhancing the survey's relevance and effectiveness in addressing children's oral health needs across the state.
