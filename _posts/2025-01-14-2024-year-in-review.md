In 2024, Imagine Housing celebrated community engagement and achievements in affordable housing on the Eastside. Case managers organized more than 450 community events and provided essential items to thousands of residents. Maintenance efforts, supported by two grants from the Washington State Department of Commerce, ensured the preservation of Andrew’s Heights and Johnson Hill communities. Yi Zhao’s leadership was recognized in the Puget Sound Business Journal’s 40 Under 40. Community advocacy played a vital role, with support for Bellevue’s C-1 Land Use Code Amendment facilitating affordable housing developments in partnership with local churches.

The transition to Indigo Property Management Services aimed to enhance the resident experience. Imagine Housing collaborated with more than 100 program partners to foster housing stability. Notably, legacy gifts from anonymous donors will significantly contribute to the development of permanent affordable housing. The organization expanded its teams in real estate development, resident programs, and asset management to serve approximately 1,500 people annually. Administrative and finance teams worked behind the scenes to ensure operational efficiency, investing in new technologies to address the growing need for affordable housing. Imagine Housing continues to create spaces where individuals and families can thrive in supportive communities.
