Over 8,800 food boxes were distributed to families at 98 Seattle Public Schools sites following the lapse of federal funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) on November 1, 2025. This funding halt, due to the Trump administration's refusal to release contingency funds during a partial government shutdown, left many families without crucial monthly benefits. Mayor Bruce Harrell declared a limited civil emergency to authorize up to $1 million per week in emergency food assistance, ensuring support for food banks and community providers until federal aid resumed.

Schools played a vital role in this effort, as they are trusted local institutions where families frequently gather. The Office of Sustainability & Environment (OSE) collaborated with Seattle Public Schools (SPS) and Cascadia Produce to swiftly distribute food boxes, each containing around 20 pounds of shelf-stable items and local produce. The coordinated response demonstrated a commitment to food security and community resilience in the face of political disruptions. Mayor Harrell lifted the civil emergency on November 22, 2025, after the successful three-week initiative that directly supported families affected by the SNAP funding crisis.
