United Way of King County, established in 1921, utilizes social media to inform the community about its programs, services, and advocacy efforts. The organization actively engages followers on Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn, highlighting partnerships with local businesses and nonprofits while promoting its mission of supporting food security, housing security, and education. In November 2023, United Way closed its account on X (formerly Twitter) due to concerns over hate speech from its CEO. Since April 30, the organization has gained 4,910 new followers and increased engagement across its platforms. Marketing strategist Kayla Dunn emphasizes the importance of diverse content styles to communicate the organization's multifaceted work effectively. Dunn encourages community members to engage with their social media by following, commenting, and sharing events, as the organization aims to broaden its online presence to better reflect its extensive community involvement. Future content will include updates on events, volunteer opportunities, and philanthropic partnerships, fostering a sense of community among followers.
