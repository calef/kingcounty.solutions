Last month, Janice Deguchi participated in a panel for the Arcora Foundation, aimed at promoting oral health equity. The discussion highlighted the challenges faced by low-income and immigrant families in accessing dental care. Many children in Head Start programs have never seen a dentist and often suffer from cavities, with oral health care not being a routine practice in their home countries. To address this, a recent event screened 427 children, identifying 26 with dental concerns needing follow-up care. The article emphasizes that health justice encompasses access to reliable information, quality providers, and resources for preventive care. It also points out the link between oral health and other health issues, such as behavior problems in children and cardiovascular diseases in adults. Health Navigators at the Seattle World School have been crucial in providing dental access to students who may have never visited a doctor or dentist before. Many adults rely on limited annual clinics or dental schools for care. The Arcora Foundation collaborates with various organizations to advocate for oral health equity across Washington, highlighting the importance of addressing these disparities for overall health justice.
