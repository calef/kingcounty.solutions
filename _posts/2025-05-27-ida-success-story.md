Sayed and his family of seven resettled in the U.S. in 2019 after the Taliban took over Afghanistan. They chose Washington for its good schools, despite California's more abundant resources for newcomers. Before settling, they traveled across the U.S. to explore various states. Now, Sayed's children are thriving in school and pursuing their dreams, with one son excelling in soccer and another achieving top grades.

Sayed has also assisted 76 families from Afghanistan in resettling in the U.S. by serving as a US tie, helping them find housing and navigate their new community. Instead of buying a house, Sayed decided to invest in a business, leveraging his veterinary background to start Badakhshan LLC, a halal meat business on a 10-acre farm in Enumclaw, south of Seattle. He travels to animal auctions in Washington and Oregon, processes meat locally, and delivers orders across the Puget Sound region.

Despite facing challenges due to limited English skills, Sayed persists in growing his business and seeks to improve his marketing strategies. Recently, he has experienced a decline in business, attributed to political uncertainties, and is working with the New Roots Fund for a loan to expand his operations.
