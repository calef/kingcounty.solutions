St. Luke’s is launching a warm clothing drive for the month of November to support neighbors in need, particularly as the homelessness crisis intensifies and colder weather approaches. With food assistance well-covered by local organizations like Edible Hope and the Ballard Food Bank, the need for warm clothing has become pressing, especially following the closure of the Bridge Care Center, which previously served as a clothing distribution point. St. Luke’s, along with other Ballard churches, will collect items such as jackets, pants, sweaters, gloves, hats, and blankets. Collected clothing will be stored and distributed at the Ballard Community Dinner on Wednesday nights. Community members are encouraged to contribute gently used or new clothing, and a donation bin will be available in the church narthex. While this drive is not a long-term solution, it aims to address immediate needs and foster community care for those less fortunate. Rev. Brian encourages everyone to consider participating in this initiative to help meet the urgent clothing needs of local residents.
