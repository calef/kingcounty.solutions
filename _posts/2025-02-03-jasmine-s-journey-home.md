  For Jasmine, 42, her car had become her home. For more than a year, she lived in her vehicle at a safe parking program in Kirkland, enduring long, cold nights, constant uncertainty, and daily struggles.

  One day, she reached out to our Vehicle Outreach Coordinator who supports the safe parking program with case management. Our coordinator met her with warmth and understanding, simply asking, _“What do you need?”_ Jasmine shared her story – she had lost her job unexpectedly, and without a steady income or savings, she could no longer afford rent. With nowhere else to go, she lived in her car.

  With care, our coordinator connected Jasmine to critical support services – food banks, healthcare, job training programs, and housing resources. When Jasmine felt overwhelmed, our coordinator encouraged her. When she had doubts and fear, they reassured her. Step by step, Jasmine rebuilt her foundation.

  Finally, Jasmine found a job and began building her savings – the first steps toward stability. Next, she focused on finding a home she could afford. Once again, with our coordinator’s help and guidance, she explored housing options and finally found a place of her own.

  Jasmine is no longer living in her car; she has a home and she couldn’t be happier!
