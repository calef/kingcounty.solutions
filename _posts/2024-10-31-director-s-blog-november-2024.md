  When many think of November, thoughts drift to the coziness of fall, pumpkin everything and gathering with those we love.

  Yet the entire month is packed with other information and events at the King County Library System.

  First, please do remember to cast your votes by November 5 at 8pm. Ballots can be dropped off at 24 KCLS library ballot boxes for your convenience. For more information, check [https://kcls.org/elections/](https://kcls.org/elections/)

  While many focus on election season, it is also budget time for KCLS. On November 20, we will hold a public budget hearing during the monthly Board of Trustees meeting. It is a chance for patrons to ask questions about the many services the Library System plans and budgets for, ranging from Mobile Services and Study Zone to ensuring our buildings are maintained in top condition.

  KCLS is committed to strong fiscal stewardship of taxpayer dollars as well as public accountability. A reflection of that can be seen in the Board of Trustees’ approval last month of a resolution retiring the capital bond that paid for new, expanded or remodeled libraries. The $172 million bond measure was approved in 2004 by voters, and the building program was completed in 2019, greatly enhancing library spaces, access, green features and programming opportunities.

  Please note that KCLS libraries will be closed for Veterans Day November 11, a national holiday that honors the many men and women who are serving or who have served and sacrificed for their country. On November 9, Skyway Library will host military veteran and author [**Secret Charles-Ford**](https://kcls.bibliocommons.com/events/669555e61be1968097db440e), discussing her book, [**_Vietnam, PTSD and Therapy: Survived all That!_**](https://kcls.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S82C1582791)

  Also on November 9, SilverKite Community Arts is holding an online [Veteran’s Day Sip and Paint](https://kcls.bibliocommons.com/events/6706c1ed22e7d8871698b13f) acrylic class, aimed at creating tributes for veterans, including red poppies.&nbsp;

  Throughout the year, KCLS offers books, DVDs, resources and assistance to the many active and retired Veterans living in our service area. For more information, visit kcls.org/veterans.

  November also is a time that we celebrate the many family caregivers as well as the Indigenous communities in King County. Staff has curated an inspiring list of titles for Native American and Alaskan Heritage Month.

  To honor National Family Caregivers Month, KCLS is featuring several programs, including a November 9 [Autumn Book Group](https://kcls.bibliocommons.com/events/6695544090b60b33004a80f8) discussing [**_Mother Lode: Confessions of a Reluctant Caregiver_**](https://kcls.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S82C2308532) **_by_**  **Gretchen Staebler**.

  KCLS is partnering with the Center for Creative Aging and Aegis Living for a [Wisdom Café](https://kcls.bibliocommons.com/events/6679b8b990b60b3300470e13) and a discussion about the importance of mentors. The November 18 event will be held at Redmond Library.

  Other caregiving resources and a staff-curated book list can be found at [www.kcls.org/caregiving](http://www.kcls.org/caregiving).

  KCLS also offers [Story Times](https://kcls.bibliocommons.com/v2/events?q=Caregiver&page=2) aimed at helping parents and caregivers of young children. These include Play and Learn activities, sensory play time and bilingual Kalaidoscope programs.

  Finally, as the days get darker–and Daylight Savings Time ends November 3­–join many of our patrons who have experienced the soothing effects of reading a good book. The Washington State Library Association, in fact, is holding an online [“Bibliotheraphy in Libraries” Summit](https://www.wla.org/wla-bibliotherapy-summit) November 16 to discuss the use of reading for therapeutic purposes and how libraries can positively impact patrons’ well-being.

  So join us online or in person, check out a book (or movie, music or digital materials), and enjoy all that your local library is offering this month.
