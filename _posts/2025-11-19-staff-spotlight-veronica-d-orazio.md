Veronica D'Orazio serves as a Creative Engagement Specialist at Aging Wisdom, driven by her appreciation for the wisdom of older adults. Influenced by her father's insights on societal biases against the elderly, she sought to foster connections with elders from a young age. At Aging Wisdom, she aims to reduce isolation among older adults and celebrate their unique perspectives. Since joining, the team has nearly doubled, which she finds enriching.

D'Orazio cherishes the deep connections she builds with clients, emphasizing the importance of presence and attentiveness. One notable success involved a client who had been paralyzed from a stroke and missed sailing. Through imaginative storytelling, she helped him envision his sailboat while in bed, allowing him to relive cherished memories. This creative exercise not only strengthened their bond but also provided a meaningful outlet for his grief.

Motivated by beauty, wonder, and gratitude, D'Orazio brings diverse experiences—such as education, literature, and nature—to her role, enhancing the well-being of older adults through creative engagement and mindfulness.
