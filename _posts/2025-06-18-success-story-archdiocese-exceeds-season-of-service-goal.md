We celebrated the Season of Service and the Archdiocese&#8217;s 175th anniversary at the commemorative Anniversary Mass hosted at St. James Cathedral on May 31<sup>st</sup>.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>These service hours are a demonstration of our faithful commitment to caring for our neighbors, especially the most vulnerable.

  <p class="has-text-align-left">There were many Days of Service hosted in our Northwest region that we could highlight.

  <p>Another highlight in the region was at our Farm Worker Center, which hosted three Days of Service. Each opportunity provided time to gather over a meal and space to reflect on the necessary and important work of the Farm Worker Center while hearing stories of the personal impact the Farm Worker Center has on clients, staff, and volunteers. One project was supporting the FMC Art Studio in a cultural art experience where volunteers supported 10 moms and 20 children at the FMC. The time together was energetic and creative. Volunteers visiting the FMC center also helped organize the emergency clothes closet and beautified the outside landscaping. Finally, volunteers also had an evening focused on education including working with students on basic literacy and Spanish tutoring.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>These six projects combined brought an estimated 125 students and faculty to serve our clients for more than 350 hours of service. They served clients in West Seattle, Shoreline, Burien, SeaTac, and Redmond providing a helping hand with needed yard work projects. Students and staff did everything from mowing lawns and raking leaves to pulling ivy. The hours spent were not just hours of yard work, they were hours of faithful service to others.&nbsp;</p>

To the Josephinum! Over Memorial Day Weekend, the Josephinum had the pleasure to welcome youth volunteers and chaperones for the Season of Service.

Mary one of the singers shared how important it was that she come down and share the gift of song that God gave her.</p>



  <p>The volunteers helped with a variety of ministry of presence activities with the residents of the Josephinum – bingo, arts &amp; crafts, games, memory bracelet making, and lunch. Ministry of presence activities are important through the Service of Service. As Shane Hall, CCS employee, at the Josephinum, shared “it was absolutely amazing to act as a bridge between our youth and our residents here at the Josephinum, all in the name of compassion, humanity, love and light.”</p>



  <p>Penny Boyd-Hall, Lead Case Manager at the Josephinum, witnessed one of those beautiful bridge moments. During lunch, one of the youth volunteers came up and asked if he could play the piano for the residents during the reflection after lunch. Penny confirms that it was not just an amazing ballad; it was an inspiration to share your gifts with others and to come together in community. &nbsp;</p>

To celebrate the 175th anniversary of the Archdiocese of Seattle, Catholics across Western Washington volunteered for the "Season of Service" from March to May 2025, aiming for 175,000 service hours. Catholic Community Services (CCS) collaborated with the Archdiocese to organize various projects, ultimately surpassing the goal by achieving over 300,000 service hours. The initiative culminated in a commemorative Anniversary Mass at St. James Cathedral on May 31st, highlighting the commitment to supporting vulnerable communities.

Numerous service projects took place, including significant contributions from the Tri Parish Food Bank and the Farm Worker Center, where volunteers engaged in food distribution and cultural activities. O’Dea High School partnered with Volunteer Services, with students contributing over 350 hours of service through yard work in local neighborhoods. Additionally, volunteers at Sebastian Place supported resident Veterans, demonstrating compassion and respect through meal services and fellowship. At the Josephinum, youth volunteers participated in engaging activities with residents, further fostering community connections. This successful Season of Service showcased the dedication of volunteers and organizations to serve those in need, reinforcing the spirit of compassion and community within the Archdiocese.
