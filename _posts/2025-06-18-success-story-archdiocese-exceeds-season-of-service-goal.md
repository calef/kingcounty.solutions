To celebrate the 175th anniversary of the Archdiocese of Seattle, Catholics across Western Washington volunteered for the "Season of Service" from March to May 2025, aiming for 175,000 service hours. Catholic Community Services (CCS) collaborated with the Archdiocese to organize various projects, ultimately surpassing the goal by achieving over 300,000 service hours. The initiative culminated in a commemorative Anniversary Mass at St. James Cathedral on May 31st, highlighting the commitment to supporting vulnerable communities.

Numerous service projects took place, including significant contributions from the Tri Parish Food Bank and the Farm Worker Center, where volunteers engaged in food distribution and cultural activities. O’Dea High School partnered with Volunteer Services, with students contributing over 350 hours of service through yard work in local neighborhoods. Additionally, volunteers at Sebastian Place supported resident Veterans, demonstrating compassion and respect through meal services and fellowship. At the Josephinum, youth volunteers participated in engaging activities with residents, further fostering community connections. This successful Season of Service showcased the dedication of volunteers and organizations to serve those in need, reinforcing the spirit of compassion and community within the Archdiocese.
