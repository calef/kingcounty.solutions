  class=\"wp-caption-text\">Tracey Miller (right) has been with her golf buddy, Amy
  Letcher, for three clinics. Letcher’s role is to help Miller navigate the course
  and provide coaching, but they’ve developed a friendship that has extended beyond
  the game.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Tracey Miller exhaled slowly as she stepped
  up to the golf ball lying in the fairway and focused her mind on this next shot,
  just as she had been taught. Then, she drew her club back and swung with all her
  might.</p>\n<p>She missed the golf ball completely; the momentum of her follow-through
  spun her around.</p>\n<p>“There’s the ‘Texas Tornado,’” Amy Letcher said, laughing.</p>\n<p>Miller
  smiled and pointed at Letcher, acknowledging she’d heard the nickname, before she
  lined herself up again, refocused and hit a solid approach toward the green.</p>\n<p>Letcher’s
  friendly teasing only lasted a moment. She quickly shifted to giving Miller feedback
  and coaching for the next shot.</p>\n<p>“The first year, I could not hit at all,”
  Miller said. “But she doesn’t judge me, and she’s always patient with me. She knows
  about my disabilities.”</p>\n<p>This was the third year they both came to the National
  Disabled Veterans Golf Clinic in Riverside, Iowa, and were partnered together all
  three years. Miller, an Army veteran of 30 years, is a participant. Letcher is her
  golf buddy—helping her navigate the course, the game of golf and sometimes even
  life.</p>\n<p><strong>Hitting a wall</strong></p>\n<p>After Miller retired from
  the Army in 2018, she said she hit a wall, struggling to fit in as she dealt with
  numerous medical issues.</p>\n<p>“I thought I was really OK, but I wasn’t,” she
  said.</p>\n<p>On deployment to Afghanistan in 2012, while she was at Forward Operating
  Base Mehtar Lam, Miller was injured by two enemy mortar rounds that struck near her.
  Her injuries included brain bleeding and a traumatic brain injury (TBI).</p>\n<p>She
  spent the next two years in rehabilitation going through physical, speech and occupational
  therapy so she could stay on active duty, but the experience drained her self-confidence.</p>\n<p>“I
  didn’t really know if I was going to be a capable senior leader,” Miller said. “But
  my care team did everything they could do to prepare me so I could finish my military
  career, and they did a great job.”</p>\n<p>When she retired, Miller said she was
  still dealing with the effects of her TBI. Her balance was off; she was struggling
  with cognitive function; and she was experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder,
  anxiety and depression.</p>\n<p>“I did hit the wall,” she said. “I didn’t enjoy
  anything.”</p>\n<p>Determined to change course, Miller sought help through the Department
  of Veterans Affairs Whole Health program at her local medical center in Temple,
  Texas.</p>\n<p>There, she was introduced to adaptive sports, including equine-assisted
  therapy, rowing and golf. Her recreation therapist recommended she apply for the
  golf clinic, which is co-presented by DAV and the VA annually.</p>\n<p>She was accepted
  to the program but anxious about going at first, “because when you have a brain
  injury and other [invisible] injuries, it’s like nobody understands,” Miller said.
  “But coming to this golf clinic and participating shows me that someone does understand
  when you have an invisible wound.”</p>\n<p>She described the feeling of attending
  the first time as being embraced by a warm blanket and gave much of the credit for
  that to her golf buddy, Letcher.</p>\n<p>“She’s always looking out for me,” Miller
  said. “She makes me feel secure and gives me confidence when I’m out there.”</p>\n<p>“That’s
  what we do,” Letcher said. “That’s what I’m here for—to make her feel comfortable
  and help her have a good time and enjoy the experience.”</p>\n<p><strong>Golf buddies:
  The vital piece</strong></p>\n<p>Miller, a DAV member of Chapter 29 in Harker Heights,
  Texas, was one of more than 200 veterans who participated in this year’s clinic.
  Each participant has a qualifying disability to attend, such as low vision or blindness,
  TBI, spinal cord injury, or amputation.</p>\n<p>Clinic staff—many of whom are VA
  prosthetists or recreation and occupational therapists—outfit participants with
  specific, customized adaptions to help them play and enjoy the experience. No two
  accommodations are the same and can range from high-visibility golf balls and auditory
  cues for aiming to prosthesis-compatible golf clubs and specialty carts to accommodate
  limited mobility.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_55532\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-55532\"

Adaptive golf programs are providing essential support for veterans, helping them navigate their recovery journeys. These initiatives focus on fostering camaraderie and connection through the sport of golf, allowing veterans to engage in physical activity while building friendships. Golf buddies, often fellow veterans or supportive volunteers, play a crucial role in this process. They offer companionship, encouragement, and motivation, which significantly enhances the overall experience for participants.

The adaptive golf programs accommodate various physical and mental challenges, ensuring inclusivity for all veterans. This accessibility allows veterans to experience the therapeutic benefits of golf, including improved physical health, increased self-esteem, and enhanced social interaction. Many participants have reported positive changes in their mental well-being, attributing their progress to the supportive network created through these programs.

Through adaptive golf, veterans are not only able to enjoy the game but also develop new skills, share their experiences, and connect with others who understand their challenges. This sense of belonging and support is vital in fostering resilience and promoting healing among veterans as they transition back into civilian life.
