If you are looking for Resource Wire on Solid Ground’s blog, it is no longer available there. However, you can still subscribe to receive Resource Wire weekly as an e-newsletter or visit its dedicated webpage, which is updated weekly with the same content as the newsletter. Resource Wire is a weekly newsletter by Solid Ground that provides news, updates, and resources aimed at individuals living on low incomes in King County. The audience includes both those seeking resources and service providers aiding their communities. Previously, Resource Wire was published as a blog post, but this format was discontinued to enhance the newsletter's usefulness for over three thousand subscribers. To subscribe, individuals can visit the Resource Wire Signup page. Additionally, readers are encouraged to share any helpful resources by emailing resourcewire@solid-ground.org.
