  <p>The holidays call for dishes that feel indulgent yet leave you feeling satisfied and energized. Traditional Thanksgiving flavors don’t have to mean oversized plates and post-feast naps. Enter Cranberry Glazed Turkey Meatballs, a wholesome twist on classic comfort, packed into portioned bites making it easier to enjoy the season without overindulging. </p>



  <p>Lean ground turkey keeps the protein high and fat content low, while old-fashioned oats step in for heavy breadcrumbs, adding fiber that helps you feel fuller with fewer bites. Fresh spinach sneaks in color and a boost of iron, vitamin C and antioxidants.</p>



  <p>And the real star? A tangy cranberry glaze delivers immune-supporting Vitamin C, while bone broth offers collagen and added protein—making this dish as restorative as it is flavorful, but far lighter than a heavy sauce or gravy.</p>



  <p>Perfect for a holiday party, potluck or as a dinner centerpiece, these meatballs make portion control effortless. </p>



  <p>See how it all comes together in this quick video from VA’s Healthy Teaching Kitchen, and remember—the best parts of the holidays aren’t just on the table, they’re shared with the people gathered around it.</p>
