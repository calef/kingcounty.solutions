Preschoolers from Launch enjoyed a sunny day at the Carpinito Brothers Pumpkin Patch, despite the typically soggy fall weather in the Pacific Northwest. Over 130 students participated in the outing, exploring the farm and interacting with various animals, including ducks, pigs, goats, bunnies, turkeys, and llamas. The children experienced a hayride, playing a game of I Spy while being towed by a tractor. A highlight of the trip was the corn pit, where kids had fun diving into dried corn kernels. The group also learned about the pumpkin life cycle and its growth process. Special thanks were given to the 39 staff members and parent volunteers who helped ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for all participants.
