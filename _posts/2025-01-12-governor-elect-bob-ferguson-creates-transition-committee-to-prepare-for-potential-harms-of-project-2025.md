  ### _Jennifer M. Allen, CEO of Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates, and King County Councilmember Jorge L. Barón will lead committee focused on protecting the rights of Washingtonians&nbsp;_

  **SEATTLE, WA** &nbsp;– Today, Governor-elect Bob Ferguson announced the second Transition Team subcommittee will focus on protecting Washingtonians from Project 2025. The Project 2025 agenda includes gutting access to abortion, mass deportations, limiting access to the ballot box, rolling back LGBTQ+ rights, ending environmental protections, warrantless surveillance, undermining collective bargaining and the rights of workers, and more.&nbsp;

  “We are preparing in case President Trump attacks Washingtonians’ core freedoms,” Governor-elect Ferguson said. “We will keep Washington moving forward no matter what happens at the federal level.”&nbsp;

  The transition working group&nbsp;will be co-chaired by Jennifer M. Allen, CEO of Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates (PPAA), and King County Councilmember Jorge L. Barón. At PPAA, Allen oversees the work protecting and promoting reproductive health, rights, and justice in Alaska, Hawai'i, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky and Washington. Councilmember Barón previously served as the Executive Director for the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project from 2008 to 2023.&nbsp;

  “I am honored to assist Governor-elect Ferguson in his transition into this new role and to co-chair this important subcommittee,” said Barón. “As an immigrant and as the proud parent of a trans daughter, I am particularly grateful that the Governor-elect is committed to protecting all Washington state residents, and especially those communities at greatest risk of having their rights attacked by the incoming federal administration.”&nbsp;

  “This is a critical time in our nation as we look to the possibility of our communities being under attack from many different directions. I’m honored to serve on Governor-elect Ferguson’s transition team and to co-chair this subcommittee to support his leadership in our state and country in championing and safeguarding reproductive rights and all of the rights of Washingtonians,” said Allen.&nbsp;

  The subcommittee’s work will culminate in policy priorities for the first 100 days of Ferguson’s term to shore up protections against the Project 2025 agenda. Additional policy focuses of the Transition Team subcommittees will be announced in the coming days.&nbsp;
