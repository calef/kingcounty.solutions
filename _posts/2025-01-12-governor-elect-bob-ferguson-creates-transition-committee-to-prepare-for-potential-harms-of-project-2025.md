Governor-elect Bob Ferguson has formed a transition committee to shield Washingtonians from potential harms of "Project 2025." The committee, co-chaired by Jennifer M. Allen, CEO of Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates, and King County Councilmember Jorge L. Barón, will focus on issues including abortion access, mass deportations, voting rights, LGBTQ+ rights, environmental protections, surveillance, and workers' rights. The committee's work will result in policy priorities for Ferguson's first 100 days in office to counter the Project 2025 agenda. Ferguson is determined to keep Washington moving forward regardless of federal level changes. Additional policy focuses will be announced soon.
