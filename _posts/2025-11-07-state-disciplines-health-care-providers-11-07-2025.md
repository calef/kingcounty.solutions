The Washington State Department of Health has announced disciplinary actions against various health care providers, including charges of unprofessional conduct against a naturopathic physician and a massage therapist. Several providers had their credentials either placed on probation, revoked, or reinstated. Notable cases include allegations of sexual misconduct and financial impropriety. The department encourages consumers to report any unprofessional behavior by health care providers. Providers have 20 days to respond to charges, which may lead to a settlement process or hearing if unresolved.
