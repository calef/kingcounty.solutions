Ten individuals have been arrested in connection with a federal indictment related to Ryan James Wedding, a former Olympic snowboarder now on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives List. The indictment includes charges of ordering the murder of a federal witness in Colombia. Wedding, 44, is accused of leading a violent drug trafficking organization that imports cocaine from Colombia to the U.S. His criminal activities involve witness intimidation and murder for profit. Following the unsealing of the indictment, law enforcement officials executed a series of arrests as part of "Operation Giant Slalom." Among those arrested are a Canadian criminal barrister, a reggaeton musician, and others linked to the organization. Attorney General Pamela Bondi emphasized the commitment to dismantling such drug trafficking networks, stating that anyone involved in selling drugs will face prosecution. Wedding faces life imprisonment if convicted, and a $15 million reward is offered for information leading to his capture. The case highlights international cooperation among law enforcement agencies to combat organized crime, with efforts to dismantle the infrastructure supporting Wedding's operations and to seek justice for the victims of his violent acts.
