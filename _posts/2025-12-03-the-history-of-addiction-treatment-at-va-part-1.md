  <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Wounds, opioids and addiction treatment for WWI Veterans</h2>



  <p>Often regarded as the first modern war, World War I was the first conflict to use machine guns, tanks, planes and chemical warfare on a mass scale. This, coupled with the international nature of the conflict, led to unprecedented casualties on the battlefield. Morphine was a common drug of choice for military physicians hoping to provide pain management to injured soldiers, and it was especially effective for men who had been gassed or contracted tuberculosis.</p>



  <p>The prescribed use of morphine during the war, however, often resulted in an addiction that followed Veterans when they returned home. While the American public generally praised World War Veterans for their service, Veteran drug addicts frequently struggled to reassimilate into a society that equated addicts with dangerous criminals.</p>



  <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Veterans&#8217; struggles with addiction post-WWI</h2>



  <p>While modern medical science understands drug addiction as a chronic brain disorder, the actual and profound impact of these drugs on the brain was not widely understood in the years after <a href="https://news.va.gov/?s=World+War+I">World War I</a>. At the time, addiction was instead viewed as a sign of moral and physical weakness on the part of the addict. New York Representative Lester Volk was among several advocates arguing that Veterans, since their addiction stemmed from their military service, did not deserve the “humiliation” that the public arbitrarily imposed on drug users. Despite this, Veterans were not immune from the negative stigma. Contemporaneous newspaper articles referred to all addicts, Veterans or not, as “suspicious, untruthful, [and] deceptive,” and warned readers to “not keep company with any other person who is an addict&#8230; even if he is your own brother or a member of your family.”</p>

  <p>Many Veterans sought to rid themselves of addiction in the years following World War I. While there was no guaranteed remedy for morphinism, suggested treatments ranged from a gradual reduction in morphine intake to a prescription of phenobarbital, or, simply, to just isolation. Some morphine addicts voluntarily committed themselves to local jails or state sanatoriums to restrict their access to the drug. Others turned to local hospitals, which admitted hundreds of Veteran morphine addicts in the early 1920’s. These hospitals often instituted the gradual withdrawal method for addiction until, in June 1921, they began administering the barbiturate phenobarbital. Veterans addicted to morphine were admitted to a closed ward where they received 2-3 daily doses of phenobarbital, which helped reduce withdrawal symptoms like restlessness, pain and insomnia. This treatment was also accompanied with warm baths, alcohol rubs and doses of castor oil. However, J.B. Bauguss, head of the neuropsychiatric division of a Mississippi Veterans’ hospital, wrote that this treatment was not “a sure and unfailing cure for drug addiction,” and that “the majority of addicts relapse when returned to their old environment.”</p>

  <p>In 1921, the newly established Veterans Bureau began caring for addicted Veterans at their hospitals, many of which were transferred from the Public Health Service. These hospitals continued using the phenobarbital method to treat morphine addiction. Instances of addiction, however, continued to rise.

At the same time, the Bureau reached out to Dr. Alexander Lambert, a physician who had worked with the American Red Cross during World War I.&nbsp;Lambert was a recognized narcotics researcher and had pioneered, in partnership with Charles B. Towns, the Towns-Lambert method of treating morphinism and alcoholism. Initially introduced in 1909, this method called for a gradual reduction in morphine intake combined with the administration of a mercury-based pill known as “blue mass” and a plant-based mixture of belladonna,&nbsp;<em>Hyoscyamus</em>, and zanthoxylum. Importantly, the treatment could be successfully completed in less than a month.

  <p>While he conceded that the Towns-Lambert method was often successful, he also argued that its reliance on toxic elements, namely belladonna, put patients at a severe risk of poisoning during treatment.

World War I led to significant advancements in medical treatment but also resulted in widespread opioid addiction among veterans. As soldiers returned home with complex wounds, the use of opioids for pain management became common. The high prescription rates during and after the war contributed to an increase in addiction cases. Many veterans struggled with the consequences of these medications, facing both physical and psychological challenges.

Efforts to address opioid addiction began to take shape as awareness grew about its prevalence among veterans. Treatment options evolved, focusing on holistic approaches that included therapy, alternative pain management techniques, and support systems. The historical context of opioid use during WWI highlights the ongoing struggle with addiction and the need for comprehensive care for those affected. Understanding the origins of this issue is crucial for developing effective strategies to combat opioid addiction in the veteran community today. Addressing both the physical and emotional wounds of veterans remains a priority in the ongoing battle against addiction.
