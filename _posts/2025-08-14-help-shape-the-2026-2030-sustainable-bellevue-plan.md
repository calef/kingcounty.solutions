The City of Bellevue has released a draft of the 2026-2030 Sustainable Bellevue Plan for public comment, open until September 8. This plan updates the current 2021-25 Sustainable Bellevue Plan and incorporates feedback from over 1,000 residents and organizations gathered since the update process began in October 2024. The draft plan aims to keep the city on track to achieve its sustainability goals, including carbon neutrality by 2050. It outlines goals, strategies, and actions across five key areas: Climate Change, Energy and Buildings, Mobility and Land Use, Materials and Waste, and Natural Systems. Bellevue intends to demonstrate leadership by reaching carbon-neutral city operations by 2040. In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the plan addresses issues like the city's tree canopy and access to mobility options. It also emphasizes climate resilience in preparing for and responding to climate change impacts to ensure a livable future for all residents. The council is expected to adopt the updated plan in late 2025. Community input is encouraged, and residents can share their thoughts through the Sustainable Bellevue Plan Update page.
