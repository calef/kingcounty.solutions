  Senator **Manka Dhingra** has long been a driving force in improving behavioral health systems across Washington. A steadfast advocate for families and individuals navigating mental health challenges, she brings both deep empathy and policy expertise to her work, including as a **former Board President of NAMI Eastside**.

  Her leadership has been pivotal in **shaping Washington’s 988 crisis response system** , ensuring it is **culturally responsive, linguistically accessible** , and designed to reach marginalized communities. Senator Dhingra’s commitment to trauma-informed, patient-centered reform is evident in her work to modernize the **Involuntary Treatment Act (ITA)**, emphasizing dignity and recovery in crisis intervention.

  Through her advocacy for **diversion services and alternatives to incarceration** , Senator Dhingra has championed the principle that people living with serious mental illness deserve **treatment, not punishment**. Her work continues to redefine how Washington supports individuals in crisis, creating pathways to care, healing, and hope.

  Senator Dhingra’s vision perfectly embodies **NAMI Eastside’s mission** : advancing compassionate policy and collaborative partnerships that help people build better lives and communities grounded in empathy and understanding.

By courageously sharing his own experiences with **anxiety and depression** in his memoir, _Lost and Broken_, he has opened new conversations about mental health — showing that **strength lies in vulnerability**.

  His openness has resonated across the nation, helping to **destigmatize mental illness** and inspiring others to seek help without shame. Beyond his personal story, Congressman Smith has used his platform in Congress to advocate for **expanded access to care, insurance parity** , and greater **federal investment in mental health services**.

  Through both his words and his work, he has become a **beacon of hope** , reminding millions that recovery is possible and that no one walks their mental health journey alone.
