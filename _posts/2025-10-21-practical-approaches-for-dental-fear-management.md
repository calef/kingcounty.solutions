Dental fear is a prevalent issue that causes many patients to avoid or delay necessary treatment, leading to adverse oral, systemic, and mental health outcomes. A course is available that addresses this issue, focusing on understanding the causes and consequences of dental fear. Participants will learn to define dental fear, recognize its prevalence, and identify approaches for assessing patients experiencing such fear. The course also covers practical management techniques to be applied in the dental clinic, allowing practitioners to support fearful patients effectively. 

The course provides 1.5 continuing dental education credits and is presented by Marilynn Rothen, a seasoned dental hygienist and educator, and Cameron L. Randall, a clinical health psychologist with extensive research in dental fear. Rothen brings over 30 years of clinical experience, particularly in managing patients with extreme dental fear, while Randall focuses on integrating behavioral health with oral health practices. Both presenters have significant academic and clinical credentials, contributing valuable insights into the management of dental fear in dental practice settings.
