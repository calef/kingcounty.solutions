Larry Cole is a dedicated volunteer with the Statewide Health Insurance Benefits Advisors (SHIBA), helping individuals navigate the complexities of Medicare. A retired mental health counselor with a background at Boeing, Larry's passion for health care advocacy stems from personal experiences, including his mother's work as a Medicare Manager. He aims to simplify Medicare for those without family support, particularly older adults and disabled individuals who struggle with understanding insurance policies.

Larry distinguishes between "healthy" and "unhealthy" insurance, criticizing high premiums and complex policies that hinder access to necessary care. He advocates for a Medicare for All program that offers comprehensive benefits, similar to Medicare Advantage plans, and is supportive of various legislative efforts in Washington state aimed at improving health care accessibility. 

Larry is also involved with Health Care is a Human Right Washington, a grassroots campaign, encouraging others to participate in advocacy by signing up for newsletters and engaging in community actions. Through his work, he strives for a more equitable health care system that ensures all individuals receive the care they need without financial burden.
