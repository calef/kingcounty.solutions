The City of Bellevue’s vehicle fleet has been recognized as the 22nd best in North America by the National Association of Fleet Administrators, marking the highest ranking for any organization in Washington state on the annual top 100 fleets list. This recognition is attributed to Bellevue's dedication to continuous improvement and its leading use of electric vehicles. The 100 Best Fleets in the Americas program aims to highlight high-performing fleet operations that foster innovation and performance enhancement.

City Manager Diane Carlson emphasized that this award reflects Bellevue’s commitment to environmental responsibility and reinforces the city’s reputation as a high-performance organization. Bellevue’s Fleet and Communications division oversees nearly 1,000 vehicles, including emergency and utility vehicles, and is actively working to enhance its electric vehicle infrastructure, including the installation of more charging stations. The city plans to convert half of its light-duty fleet to electric vehicles by 2030, with a goal of achieving a fully electric light-duty fleet by 2040. Additionally, the award acknowledges Bellevue’s focus on long-term financial sustainability and staff development within its fleet management practices.
