Twenty years ago, a woman began experiencing flashbacks of sexual abuse by her father, which she initially struggled to accept due to the lack of visual clarity in her memories. After confiding in her husband, she was met with disbelief, which deepened her internal conflict. Despite evidence of her father's alcoholism and abusive behaviors, she grappled with acknowledging the truth of her trauma. Years later, after moving to Seattle and seeking help for disordered eating linked to her past, she was referred to the King County Sexual Assault Resource Center (KCSARC). There, her therapist named her husband's reaction as a "negative disclosure experience," a term that resonated with her and highlighted the challenges survivors face in being believed. Throughout therapy, she found herself needing to validate her trauma, especially as her family denied the abuse. A turning point came when her therapist affirmed her experience with a powerful statement of belief, providing the validation she longed for. This encounter emphasized the importance of supportive language in the healing process, illustrating how critical it is for survivors to be believed and understood on their journeys to recovery.
