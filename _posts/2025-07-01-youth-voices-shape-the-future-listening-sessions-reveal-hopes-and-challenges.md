Young people in Benton and Franklin Counties recently participated in Community Needs Assessment listening sessions hosted by LCSNW, where they shared their concerns and aspirations for the future. Held on May 20 and June 26, these sessions involved 26 participants aged 16 to 21, marking the introduction of the NextGen Leaders initiative aimed at empowering youth and fostering solutions for a healthier community. Through various activities, attendees reflected on their experiences, identifying community strengths and challenges, such as safety in schools and job opportunities. Program Director Andrea Peyton emphasized the importance of youth perspectives in decision-making, stating that young people have creative solutions to community challenges. Participants expressed appreciation for the Tri-Cities' cultural diversity while also voicing concerns about the pressure to plan their futures. The initiative plans to establish a youth-led council to advocate for the needs of local teenagers and young adults, with the first council meeting set for July 31. LCSNW aims to collaborate with local organizations to enhance support systems for youth, empowering them to take an active role in shaping programs and services that impact their lives.
