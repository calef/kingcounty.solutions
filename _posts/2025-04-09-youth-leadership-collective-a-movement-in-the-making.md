  <p>Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) policies are under attack nationwide. We see a need to support the development of the leaders of tomorrow, today. In our last newsletter, we released a statement about our commitment to <a href="https://bikeworks.org/rolling-forward-with-dei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DEI and our investment in Youth Leadership</a>. Now, we want to share precisely what that means.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Young people have been central to our mission at Bike Works since our inception back in 1996. We’ve been active in summer camps and youth riding clubs, and now we partner with several public schools and non-profits in our neighborhood. We have always had something to offer kids, but have we ever truly given them space to lead?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p>What does it mean to step back and listen? What is youth leadership, and how do we create opportunities for individuals who are not typical leaders? And what does it look like when youth are able to exercise individual and collective power? These are a few of the questions Bike Works’ program staff have been mulling over the past few years, until Youth Program Coordinator Cornell Green recognized a pattern in the requests he was getting from youth. They didn’t just want to go on bike rides, they wanted to plan the routes. They didn’t just want to attend programming; they wanted to help design curriculum.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>It is in this spirit that Bike Works is investing $450,000 in the Youth Leadership Collective with intention and sureness of heart. We are working towards the future we want today by ensuring youth have space to be kids, to explore, to be curious, to flourish, and to enact self-determination upon the spaces and places they choose.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>This new approach is the result of years of dreaming, reflection, and listening. As Green says, “This is something I’ve always wanted. It’s something I needed as a youth, and now we’re bringing it to life—together.”&nbsp;</p>



  <p>That belief has taken new shape with the launch of our <strong>Youth Leadership Collective</strong>—an intentional space where youth are not only invited to lead but supported in building the tools and confidence to do so.&nbsp;</p>



  <p><strong>The path to Collective Power</strong>&nbsp;</p>



  <p>The term “collective” is deliberate. “Collective” speaks to inclusion, growth, and transformation. It says: you belong here. And further, says Youth Programs Manager&nbsp; iea tov, “We are seeing a lot of youth who have technically aged out of programming still showing up. Some of these kids have been in Bike Works programming for years, though they don’t all feel ready to move on to the adult programs we offer.”&nbsp;</p>



  <p>This leadership opportunity is also a powerful way to keep youth involved after they’ve completed traditional programming. Many young people have expressed a desire for more responsibility, more connection, more growth—but until now, there hasn’t always been a clear path forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p>In response, we’ve been developing a volunteer program alongside the Youth Leadership Collective to create meaningful steppingstones for these alumni—especially those who don’t yet feel connected to the adult-facing side of Bike Works. By rooting these opportunities in the relationships and community they already know and trust, we’re creating a space where former participants can continue showing up, contributing, and growing in ways that feel good, grounded, like they belong, and in community with peers and mentors aligned with who they are becoming.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>That spirit of belonging is woven throughout the design of the Youth Leadership Collective. It was born from a need to create more opportunities for youth to go deeper—to move from participating in programs to shaping them. There are youth who consistently show up and ask, “What else can I do?” inspired this effort. They don’t just want to attend programs; they want a seat at the table.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>“As a teacher,” says tov, “one of my favorite things to tell students is that every social movement which has enacted positive change has been led by youth. Youth really are the change makers, and it’s our job to leverage our experience and resources in a way that fosters the next generation.”&nbsp;</p>



  <p><strong>Leadership, Redefined</strong>&nbsp;</p>



  <p>The Youth Leadership Collective recognizes that leadership isn’t one-size-fits-all. It’s not just about being the loudest voice or taking charge in the traditional sense. As one team member put it: “Leadership might look like doing the dishes, or it might look like leading a protest. It’s about identifying your strengths and stepping into your own power.”&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Through a structured eight-week pilot program launching May 4, youth participants will explore leadership through self-assessment, project design, and community engagement. Each week will build on the last, helping participants identify their skills, collaborate with peers, and develop a project that reflects their values and vision. Weekly sessions will be paired with independent work, encouraging ongoing reflection and application.&nbsp;</p>



  <p><strong>Creating On-Ramps, Not Roadblocks</strong>&nbsp;</p>



  <p>One key goal of the program is to make leadership accessible. Too often, youth development opportunities are limited to those who already see themselves as leaders or those who have been identified as leaders by others. At Bike Works, we’re flipping the script—building “on-ramps” so that any young person can find their way into leadership.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>This isn’t about creating a separate program; it’s about embedding leadership into everything we do. From Saturday drop-ins to summer camps, from mechanic classes to group rides—every interaction becomes a chance for growth.&nbsp;</p>



  <p><strong>Beyond the Bike</strong>&nbsp;</p>



  <p>While the bicycle is our tool, it’s never been the whole story. “It’s not really about the bike,” staff member tov says. “It’s about what the bike allows us to do—how it helps us address injustice, build community, and explore who we are.”&nbsp;</p>



  <p>That’s why the Youth Leadership Collective also serves as a bridge to broader opportunities: career pathways, internships, volunteer leadership roles, and future summits—like the Youth Bike Summit, which Bike Works hopes to reintegrate into. The long-term vision includes creating sustainable relationships with outside organizations to offer real-world experiences beyond the walls of our shop.&nbsp;</p>



  <p><strong>What’s Next?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Perhaps the most powerful question guiding this initiative is a simple one: <strong>Now what?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



  <p>It’s what we ask our youth after a program ends. It’s what they ask us in return. It’s a call to action, a challenge to keep dreaming, building, and growing. It keeps us all moving forward—together.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>As Rich Brown, the Youth Programs Director puts it: “When young people start asking &#8216;now what?&#8217; that’s when you know you’ve lit a fire. And it’s up to us to keep feeding that spark.”&nbsp;</p>



  <p><strong>Want to support the Youth Leadership Collective?</strong>&nbsp;<br>We’re looking for collaborators, partners, and anyone who believes in youth power. Reach out if you want to help build the next generation of community leaders.&nbsp;</p>

Bike Works is launching the Youth Leadership Collective, a $450,000 initiative aimed at fostering youth leadership and empowering young people to take charge of their development. Recognizing the need for inclusive leadership opportunities, the program encourages youth to not only participate in existing activities but also to design and direct their own experiences. The initiative stems from staff observations that many young participants wanted to engage more deeply, seeking roles that allowed them to shape programming and contribute meaningfully.

The Collective is designed to provide a supportive environment where youth can explore their strengths, engage in community projects, and collaborate with peers. An eight-week pilot program will facilitate self-assessment, project design, and skill development, making leadership accessible to all, regardless of previous experiences. By embedding leadership into all aspects of Bike Works' activities, the initiative aims to create pathways for youth to continue their involvement beyond traditional programming.

The Youth Leadership Collective also aspires to connect participants with broader opportunities, including internships and community engagement, ultimately serving as a bridge to future leadership roles. The initiative emphasizes the importance of youth as change-makers and seeks to cultivate a sense of belonging and empowerment within the community.
