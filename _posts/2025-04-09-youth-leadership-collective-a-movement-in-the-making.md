Bike Works is launching the Youth Leadership Collective, a $450,000 initiative aimed at fostering youth leadership and empowering young people to take charge of their development. Recognizing the need for inclusive leadership opportunities, the program encourages youth to not only participate in existing activities but also to design and direct their own experiences. The initiative stems from staff observations that many young participants wanted to engage more deeply, seeking roles that allowed them to shape programming and contribute meaningfully.

The Collective is designed to provide a supportive environment where youth can explore their strengths, engage in community projects, and collaborate with peers. An eight-week pilot program will facilitate self-assessment, project design, and skill development, making leadership accessible to all, regardless of previous experiences. By embedding leadership into all aspects of Bike Works' activities, the initiative aims to create pathways for youth to continue their involvement beyond traditional programming.

The Youth Leadership Collective also aspires to connect participants with broader opportunities, including internships and community engagement, ultimately serving as a bridge to future leadership roles. The initiative emphasizes the importance of youth as change-makers and seeks to cultivate a sense of belonging and empowerment within the community.
