topics:
- Education & Learning
---

This year, Seattle voters will decide on the renewal of the Family, Education, Preschool, and Promise (FEPP) Levy, which funds essential early learning programs, particularly the Seattle Preschool Program (SPP). The SPP provides affordable preschool options for low-income families, featuring a nationally-accredited curriculum designed to prepare children for kindergarten. Providers express appreciation for the support they receive through the SPP, enabling them to offer high-quality education regardless of families' economic situations. If Proposal 1 passes, the SPP will be renewed and expanded for another seven years; failure to do so would mean the program's dissolution, resulting in over 3,000 children losing access to quality early education.

Additionally, the article highlights a recent development in New Mexico, where a new bill will provide free child care for all families starting November 1, allowing families to save significantly on child care costs. This serves as an example of how systemic change is achievable through advocacy. The article emphasizes the importance of voter participation and encourages residents to check their voter registration status ahead of the upcoming election.
