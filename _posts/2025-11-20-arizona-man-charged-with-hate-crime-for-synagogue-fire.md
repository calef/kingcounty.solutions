A federal grand jury in Phoenix has indicted Everardo Gregorio, 31, from Casa Grande, Arizona, on a charge of Obstruction of the Free Exercise of Religious Beliefs by Fire. The indictment alleges that Gregorio intentionally set fire to Khal Chasidim, a synagogue, on March 3, resulting in the destruction of the worship space and a kosher grocery store and restaurant located within the building. In addition to the federal charge, Gregorio faces arson charges from the Pinal County Attorney’s Office and is awaiting trial in that case. If convicted of the federal charge, he could face a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000. The investigation is being conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the Casa Grande Police Department, with Assistant U.S. Attorney Ben Goldberg overseeing the prosecution alongside the Department of Justice’s Civil Rights Division. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.
