Governor-elect Bob Ferguson has announced the formation of a transition committee to improve public safety in Washington State. The committee will be chaired by State Senator and former Snohomish County Sheriff John Lovick. It will focus on empowering the state's law enforcement through measures such as a $100 million grant program for local governments to hire more well-trained police officers, increasing resources to pursue individuals who evade court supervision, and developing a crisis response plan to handle the state's fentanyl epidemic. The committee will include members of Ferguson’s bipartisan, 55-member Transition Team and other appointees.
