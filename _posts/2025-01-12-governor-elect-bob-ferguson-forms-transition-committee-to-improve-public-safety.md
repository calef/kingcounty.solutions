  **_State Senator and Former Sheriff John Lovick Will Lead the Transition Effort&nbsp;_**

  **SEATTLE, WA** &nbsp;– Today, Governor-elect Bob Ferguson announced that State Senator and former Snohomish County Sheriff John Lovick (D-Mill Creek) will chair his transition committee focused on improving public safety and increasing the number of well-trained law enforcement in Washington.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  “Our public safety challenges, including a statewide fentanyl epidemic, require immediate action,” said Ferguson. “Washington ranks last in the nation for law enforcement per capita. That’s unacceptable – it will change while I am Governor.”&nbsp;

  State Senator John Lovick is the former Snohomish County Sheriff and served in the Washington State Patrol for decades. The subcommittee will include a diverse group of stakeholders and will focus on strategies to improve safety, including:&nbsp;&nbsp;

  1. A $100 million grant program for local governments to hire more well-trained police officers;
  2. Increasing resources within the Department of Corrections to pursue every individual who absconds from their court supervision responsibilities; and
  3. Develop and implement a crisis response plan to combat the fentanyl epidemic.&nbsp;

  “I can’t think of a better focus for the next administration than improving public safety and I trust Governor-elect Ferguson on these tough issues,” said Lovick. “It is critical that people not only are safe but feel safe – in their homes, neighborhoods, and schools.”&nbsp;&nbsp;

  The subcommittee will include members of Ferguson’s bipartisan, 55-member Transition Team and other Washingtonians appointed by Lovick.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  Ferguson’s Transition Team will establish a strategic plan to help Ferguson implement his priorities for the first 100 days of his new administration.&nbsp;
