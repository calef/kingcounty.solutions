As the holiday season approaches, Seattle Public Utilities announces changes to waste collection schedules. There will be no collections on Thanksgiving Day (November 27, 2025), Christmas Day (December 25, 2025), and New Year’s Day (January 1, 2026). If your regular collection day falls on these holidays, service will be delayed by one day: Thursday collections will occur on Friday, and Friday collections will shift to Saturday. Collections for Monday through Wednesday will remain unchanged. 

Additionally, the North and South Transfer Stations will be closed on these holidays, resuming normal hours the following day. Seattle residents are encouraged to compost holiday trees and greens for free from December 26 to January 31. Trees must be stripped of decorations, cut into sections of four feet or less, and placed next to the Food & Yard Waste cart on collection days. Apartment residents can put out up to two trees at no charge, and drop-off options for trees under eight feet are available at Transfer Stations.

During winter, snow and ice may disrupt collection services. Updates regarding any collection delays can be found on Seattle Public Utilities' website and social media platforms.
