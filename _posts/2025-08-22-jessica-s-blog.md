From a decade of trauma and abuse, a woman recounts her journey from fear to freedom. After escaping an abusive partner, she faced ongoing harassment even while he was in prison. Struggling with heroin addiction, she realized her substance abuse was a symptom of deeper mental health issues. With the support of a new counselor and exposure therapy from KCSARC, she confronted her buried trauma. As she processed her experiences, she learned about the various forms of domestic violence, including emotional and psychological abuse.

Guided by her therapist, she sought a Domestic Violence Protection Order (DVPO) to ensure her safety. Although fear returned as her abuser's release approached, she worked with KCSARC to secure a lifetime DVPO. Eight years later, she reflects on her transformation into a brave, artistic individual, living a fulfilling life with her partner and supporting other women in their healing journeys. Her story emphasizes the importance of therapy, support, and the courage to heal from trauma, reminding others that recovery is possible and that living without fear is achievable. KCSARC offers resources and a 24-hour helpline for those in need of support.
