More residents in Washington State are facing economic challenges, with rising grocery prices contributing to increased stress and anxiety. In Southeast King County, 25% of people are food insecure, and approximately 16,868 individuals are homeless. Proposed budget cuts threaten vital programs like SNAP, Medicaid, and food banks, highlighting the need for advocacy for anti-hunger and anti-poverty policies. Residents are encouraged to engage local and federal legislators by sharing personal stories and experiences to emphasize the importance of these resources.

In February, advocates from across the state gathered for Hunger Action Day to discuss the 2025 Legislative Agenda, which includes priorities such as extending funding for food banks ($93.25 million), fully funding senior nutrition programs ($35.4 million), and maintaining support for SNAP incentive programs. Residents can find their legislators by visiting the Washington State Legislature website and contacting them about relevant policies.

When reaching out, individuals should introduce themselves, express their position on specific bills, share personal perspectives, and conclude with a request for action. Collective advocacy is crucial, as one person's voice can represent many constituents, and efforts are needed to ensure food security and support for vulnerable communities in Washington State.
