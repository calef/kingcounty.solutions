Centering student voice is essential in the STEMbyTAF model, which emphasizes equity in education. At Olympic View, Ms. Lizzy's 6th and 7th graders engaged in a project to advocate for new extracurricular activities. Collaborating with STEMbyTAF Transformation Coach Dr. Arleatha Bryant, students learned to pitch their ideas to school leadership, addressing the lack of extracurricular options at their school. They worked in groups to draft business plans, considering their target audience, budget, and execution strategies.

During presentations of learning, students showcased their proposals through posters, prototypes, and interactive designs, receiving authentic feedback from the community. Notably, former Seahawks wide receiver Doug Baldwin participated, providing insights on self-advocacy and determination. The project culminated in students pitching their club ideas to the principal, resulting in the establishment of a cooking club, an art club, and a Pacific Islander club, all meeting weekly. This initiative demonstrated the importance of student voice, empowering them to become effective communicators and empathetic leaders, ready to make an impact in their communities.
