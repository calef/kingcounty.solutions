Centering student voice is essential in the STEMbyTAF model, fostering equity in the classroom. At Olympic View, students in Ms. Lizzy's 6th and 7th grades learned to advocate for themselves by pitching new extracurricular activities to school leadership. Previously, the school had no such activities, prompting students to collaborate in groups to draft business plans, identify their target audience, and develop execution strategies. They presented their ideas during community-facing presentations, which are integral to the STEMbyTAF process, allowing them to receive authentic feedback.

Former Seahawks player Doug Baldwin engaged with students as they shared their proposals, helping them reflect on their potential and the importance of self-advocacy. Guided by Ms. Lizzy and Dr. Arleatha Bryant, students successfully pitched their club ideas to the principal, resulting in the establishment of a cooking club, an art club, and a Pacific Islander club, all of which now meet weekly. This experience highlighted the significance of student voices, equipping them to become effective communicators and empathetic leaders who can enact change in their communities.
