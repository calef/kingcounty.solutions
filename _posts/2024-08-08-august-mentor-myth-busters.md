  When people ask how to become [Youth Success Mentors](https://empoweryouthnetwork.org/youth-success-mentoring/)
  (YSM) with Empower Youth Network (EYN), there are some frequently asked questions
  that we have become familiar with. In an effort to ease folks into our Back-to-School
  Challenge so that we meet our goal of enrolling 70 mentors, we will be sharing Mentor
  Myth Busters with you!\n\nWondering about the time commitment, effort, or energy
  it takes to be a mentor? Read testimonials below that share why mentoring is worth
  it, and why mentoring is probably even more of a possibility for you than you might
  realize.\n\n**Karen:**\n\nMentoring has been an amazing experience for Karen, and
  she looks forward to collaborating with her mentees each week. Karen tries to schedule
  her vacations before mentoring begins in the fall or during school vacations. She
  says, _“Of course, there are times when I do have to miss but I do my best to make
  that minimal.”_&nbsp; We completely understand! YSM staff will work with you to
  create a schedule that works for you.\n\n**Pam:**  \n_“Since I am retired, it is
  easy to work [mentoring] into my schedule plus there are lots of options to choose
  from.”_&nbsp; If something comes up, YSM staff make it possible to adjustment your
  mentoring timeline.\n\n**Sandy:**  \n_“As far as the barriers to being a mentor,
  initially I was concerned that I couldn’t take trips with my husband and family.
  It turns out that works out!”_&nbsp; Sandy says staff has been very accommodating
  if she needs to change days or cannot make it to her mentee because of a trip. “_We
  don’t want to disappoint our mentees, but it works out!”_\n\n**Sharissa:**  \n_“Going
  back to work as a teacher is what prompted me to want to mentor.”_&nbsp; Moving
  the time commitment from an hour down to 30 minutes weekly greatly helped Sharissa
  have the time to mentor. When she looked into the mentoring program a few years
  ago, the time commitment was one hour weekly. While YSM tries to ensure providing
  a full hour of mentoring as much as possible, there is the possibility of arranging
  for meetings to be within 30 minutes!\n\n**Michael:**  \nMichael initially took
  pause on becoming a mentor because he was unsure of the time commitment, or what
  he would do with his mentee. If you did not know, YSM can supply anything from STEM
  kits to games for mentors to utilize for enriched meetings with their mentees. _“I
  just realized there was a need and I had the time and desire to help,”_&nbsp; Michael
  says. It was that realization that motivated him to apply. Michael says he feels
  there are no barriers to his mentoring and it fits easily into his life.\n\nHelp
  us get a head start on our Back-to-School Challenge, and [apply to become a mentor
