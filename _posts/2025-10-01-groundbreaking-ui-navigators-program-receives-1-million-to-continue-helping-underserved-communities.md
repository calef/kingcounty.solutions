The Employment Security Department's Unemployment Insurance (UI) Navigator program has received $1 million in funding from the state Legislature, allowing it to continue for another year. Over the past 16 months, this program has assisted more than 7,000 people in underserved communities in better understanding their unemployment benefits. The UI Navigator program connects Employment Security staff with community organizations to reduce barriers to access, ensuring benefits are available to all qualified workers. Since its launch in January 2024, nine organizations have helped individuals across 58 counties and 288 cities, assisting clients who speak at least 40 different languages. The Navigators have notably supported over 300 veterans and 145 individuals with disabilities. Originally funded by a $2.1 million U.S. Department of Labor grant, the program's state funding will extend contracts with the UI Navigators to continue their outreach and services, effective July 1, 2025. Employment Security Commissioner Cami Feek expressed gratitude for the Legislature's recognition of the program's value in these communities, highlighting its positive impact on Washington workers and their families.
