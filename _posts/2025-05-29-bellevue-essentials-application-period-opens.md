Bellevue Essentials is accepting applications for its fall 2025 civic engagement course, running from September 10 to November 12. This 10-week program offers Bellevue residents insight into city government operations and decision-making processes. The course includes eight Wednesday classes from 5:30 to 8:30 p.m., one Tuesday evening class, and a Saturday field trip to local neighborhoods and parks. Since its inception in 2013, over 400 participants have graduated, with many now actively involved in city boards, commissions, and neighborhood associations. The program focuses on interactive learning, allowing participants to understand the challenges and collaborations within the city. Graduates leave with knowledge on influencing municipal decision-making, a broader personal network, and increased awareness of volunteer opportunities. Tuition for the course is $150, with fee waivers available. To complete the program, participants must attend at least eight sessions. Applications are due by 5 p.m. on July 23. For more information, residents can contact Sarina Miller at 425-452-4295 or via email.
