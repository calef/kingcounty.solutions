Seattle Indian Health Board has secured significant funding to enhance women's mental and physical health services after a competitive selection process involving over 4,000 organizations globally. Esther Lucero, President and CEO, expressed gratitude for the funding, which is crucial amid federal budget cuts that jeopardized several services. The funding will preserve the family services division, including vital wraparound services and the WIC program. Awards ranged from $1 million to $5 million, and the board plans to focus on maternal health, behavioral health, and intimate partner violence services while addressing the needs of pregnant and parenting women facing substance use disorders. Alarmingly, American Indian and Alaska Native women in Washington are 8.5 times more likely to die from pregnancy-related conditions than their Non-Hispanic White counterparts. Additionally, a survey revealed that 94% of Native women in Seattle experienced rape or coercion at some point. Lucero emphasized the importance of philanthropic support in sustaining these essential programs. The funding comes from the Action for Women’s Health initiative, which is backed by Pivotal, a consortium founded by Melinda French Gates, and managed by Lever for Change.
