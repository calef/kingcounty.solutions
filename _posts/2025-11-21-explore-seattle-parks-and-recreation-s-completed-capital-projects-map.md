Seattle Parks and Recreation (SPR) has launched a Cycle 2 Capital Project Completions Map to showcase completed projects funded by the Seattle Park District Cycle 2 financial plan from 2023 to 2028. This initiative includes the renovation of 27 restrooms, 33 play areas, and the elimination of accessibility barriers, alongside the development of new parks and major maintenance of community centers. The map allows users to filter completed projects by type, year, or council district, providing detailed information on each project. It is part of SPR's commitment to transparency and ongoing public reporting, updating financial and performance dashboards biannually and releasing an annual report. The map only covers projects finalized during Cycle 2 and does not include those in planning stages or completed prior to 2023. Additionally, it excludes urban forestry restoration projects and capital projects lacking a specific geographic location. Regular updates will reflect progress towards achieving Cycle 2 goals, emphasizing SPR's extensive and complex capital improvement plan, which features numerous active projects at various stages.
