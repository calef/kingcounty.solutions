  <p>The King County Flood Control District (KCFCD), in partnership with King County as its service provider, completed construction of an important habitat restoration project in Three Forks Natural Area near North Bend in September 2025. The <strong>North Fork Snoqualmie River Confluence Revetment Removal Project</strong> removed a decades-old rock revetment, known as the Scott Revetment, to restore natural river processes, improve fish and wildlife habitat, and eliminate long-term maintenance costs for a facility that no longer serves a flood risk reduction purpose.</p>

  <p>By removing the rock armoring, the river can reconnect with its floodplain and resume natural processes, such as eroding, depositing gravel, and shifting gently over time. These are essential processes for sustaining fish and wildlife habitat, revitalizing riparian forests, and increasing flood storage capacity in a natural, healthy way.</p>

This was a KCFCD project on the Middle Fork Snoqualmie River, which was implemented by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in partnership with King County. Because this levee rehabilitation project site offered limited opportunities for habitat enhancement, a secondary location was identified to offset impacts. The confluence of the Middle Fork and North Fork Snoqualmie rivers emerged as a perfect fit, being that it is only two miles downstream, ecologically valuable, and fully capable of supporting restoration.</p>

  <p>“I’m grateful we were able to get the North Fork Snoqualmie River Confluence Revetment Removal Project constructed this year,” said Sarah Perry, Vice Chair of the King County Flood Control District. “By pairing it with a nearby levee rehabilitation project, we’re making every public dollar work harder, reducing flood risks for people while restoring a more natural, living river system at the same time. This is the kind of work that helps to protect our communities and strengthens the environment for fish, wildlife, and future generations.”</p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"><strong>A Place of Convergence: Ecological and Cultural Significance</strong></h2>



  <p>The project sits at a unique landscape feature where the North Fork and Middle Fork Snoqualmie rivers come together. This area is culturally significant for indigenous people who have been in the Snoqualmie Valley since time immemorial gathering, harvesting foods, and hunting. The area is also ecologically rich with fish, birds, and other wildlife calling this floodplain home. Elk, black bear, cougar, river otter, and deer use the Three Forks valley as a major migration corridor in their search for food and water, safe breeding locations, and to find better living conditions.</p>



  <p>Reconnecting the river with its natural floodplain will:</p>



  <ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>Improve aquatic habitat conditions</li>



  <li>Restore natural river processes</li>



  <li>Remove artificial constraints on the river channel</li>



  <li>Support wooded areas and forests vital to riparian ecosystems</li>



  <li>Reduce future maintenance obligations for the KCFCD and King County</li>

  <p>The project removed approximately 600 feet of rock revetment, allowing the river to naturally shape the bank over time.</p>

  <li>Monitoring through 2029 to ensure long-term ecological success</li>

Because this levee rehabilitation project site offered limited opportunities for habitat enhancement, a secondary location was identified to offset impacts. The confluence of the Middle Fork and North Fork Snoqualmie rivers emerged as a perfect fit, being that it is only two miles downstream, ecologically valuable, and fully capable of supporting restoration.

The North Fork Snoqualmie River is undergoing a significant restoration project aimed at improving the river's health and resilience. The initiative focuses on enhancing habitat for fish and wildlife, particularly salmon, by restoring natural river functions and stabilizing banks. Key measures include re-establishing native vegetation, creating floodplain connectivity, and reducing erosion. The restoration involves collaboration among various stakeholders, including local agencies, conservation groups, and community members. Funding for the project comes from public sources and grants, emphasizing a commitment to environmental stewardship. The project is expected to yield long-term ecological benefits, contributing to the overall sustainability of the region's river systems. Community engagement plays a crucial role, with opportunities for local residents to participate in restoration efforts and monitor progress. The project exemplifies a proactive approach to river management, recognizing the importance of healthy waterways for both ecosystems and human communities.
