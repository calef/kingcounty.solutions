Hamdi Mohamed, a local immigration leader in Seattle, is responding to the impacts of shifting federal policies on immigrant and refugee families. The recent article highlights the challenges these families face, including job insecurity and fear of separation. The Refugee Women’s Alliance (ReWA) plays a crucial role in this context, having served Seattle's immigrant communities for over 40 years. ReWA provides comprehensive support services that extend beyond legal assistance, including English language classes, job readiness training, housing support, domestic violence counseling, and early childhood education. These resources are essential for helping families achieve stability and self-sufficiency during uncertain times.
