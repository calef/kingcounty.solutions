An Oklahoma man, Travis Ford, was sentenced to five years in prison after defrauding investors in a cryptocurrency Ponzi scheme that raised $9.4 million from about 2,800 individuals. As the CEO and head trader of Wolf Capital Crypto Trading LLC, Ford promoted the firm through its website and social media, falsely claiming he could deliver high returns of 1–2% daily, equating to approximately 547% annually. In his guilty plea, Ford admitted he did not believe these returns were achievable and acknowledged that he and his co-conspirators made false promises to attract investments. Instead of investing the funds as promised, Ford misappropriated the money for personal benefit and that of his associates, causing significant financial harm to investors. In January 2025, he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud. In addition to his prison sentence, Ford was ordered to forfeit over $1 million and pay more than $170,000 in restitution to his victims. The case was prosecuted by the Justice Department’s Fraud Section, with investigations led by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.
