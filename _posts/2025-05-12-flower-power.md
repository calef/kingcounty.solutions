  Our After-School Program had the special opportunity to arrange bouquets, thanks to the Women’s University Club Foundation. They generously brought flowers and vases for our kiddos to use in creating heartfelt gifts for the important women and people in their lives.

  Just before everyone sat down to cut stems, tie bows, and craft their arrangements, the After-School kids were outside soaking up the early spring sunshine—playing kickball, running through the grass, and just being kids. Energy levels were high! Outside time is crucial to youths’ experience with the program as that time gives them the opportunity to socialize and target any stress from the day into being physically active.

  Our volunteers arrived ready to set up a classroom inside. “Can I help?” one of the boys asked a volunteer as she unpacked buckets of flowers from her car.

  Thank you to the Women’s University Club for such a rosy, hands-on, and unforgettable experience!

Our after-school program had a wonderful opportunity to create flower arrangements, thanks to the Women's University Club Foundation, which provided flowers and vases. Before crafting, the children enjoyed outdoor activities like kickball and running, which allowed them to socialize and relieve stress. The energy was high as volunteers set up the classroom inside. One boy took the initiative to help unpack flowers, encouraging his peers to join in. This collaborative spirit continued as the children learned from the Women’s University Club volunteers how to use garden shears and arrange flowers. This event transcended mere gift-making; it fostered a sense of community and allowed the youth to engage with skills and talents in a supportive environment. The experience was memorable and impactful, highlighting the importance of hands-on activities in youth development.
