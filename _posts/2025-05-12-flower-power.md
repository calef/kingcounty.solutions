Our After-School Program had a wonderful opportunity to create flower arrangements, thanks to the Women's University Club Foundation, which provided flowers and vases. Before crafting, the children enjoyed outdoor activities like kickball and running, which allowed them to socialize and relieve stress. The energy was high as volunteers set up the classroom inside. One boy took the initiative to help unpack flowers, encouraging his peers to join in. This collaborative spirit continued as the children learned from the Women’s University Club volunteers how to use garden shears and arrange flowers. This event transcended mere gift-making; it fostered a sense of community and allowed the youth to engage with skills and talents in a supportive environment. The experience was memorable and impactful, highlighting the importance of hands-on activities in youth development.
