The Justice Department has seized unlawful 7-OH products from three warehouses in California. The action is part of a broader effort to combat the illegal sale of synthetic drugs. These products, marketed as dietary supplements, contain a substance related to the banned compound 7-OH, which can pose serious health risks. The seizures were executed following an investigation that identified multiple violations of federal law regarding the sale and distribution of controlled substances. The Department emphasizes the importance of ensuring that products sold to consumers are safe and comply with legal regulations. This enforcement action aims to deter the distribution of dangerous synthetic drugs and protect public health. The Justice Department remains committed to addressing the challenges posed by unregulated substances in the market.
