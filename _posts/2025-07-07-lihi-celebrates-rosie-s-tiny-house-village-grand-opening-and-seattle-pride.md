On July 2nd, Rosie’s Tiny House Village celebrated its grand reopening in North Seattle, featuring 37 tiny houses designed to assist individuals experiencing homelessness. This enhanced 24/7 shelter provides a pathway to permanent housing for approximately 40 to 50 residents, offering support with identification, income applications, and access to various services. Speakers at the event included Reverend Lawrence Willis, who emphasized the importance of community support, and representatives from LIHI and local government, highlighting the urgent need for solutions to homelessness, which has surged by 26% in King County since 2022. The village, located at 12201 Aurora Ave N, is near public transportation and essential services. Local volunteers contributed to the construction of the tiny houses, and LIHI established a Community Advisory Council to ensure community engagement. Additionally, LIHI participated in Seattle's 51st annual Pride Parade on June 29th, showcasing their rainbow tiny house and promoting unity against anti-LGBTIQ+ policies. The event attracted nearly 300,000 participants, emphasizing the theme "Louder" as a call for solidarity.
