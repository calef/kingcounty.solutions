  <p>My name is Gloriann Figueroa, and I have been working at Angel Flight West (AFW) as a Marketing and Communications Intern since the beginning of this year. In May, I graduated with my BA in Nonprofit Management from the University of North Texas. I&#8217;ve had such an incredible experience with AFW and have been fortunate enough to apply the skills I obtained as a student.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Having a career in the nonprofit sector has always been my dream. I’ve had a knack for helping others and I continue to find purpose in meaningful work. Before this internship, I had a background in social media, writing, and campaigning, which led me to decide that this internship best aligned with my interests and knowledge. I was so excited to learn more about nonprofit communications, but I didn’t expect just how much experience I would gain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p>One of the most rewarding aspects of this internship has been getting to know the stories behind the mission—whether it’s passengers who inspire with their strength or volunteers who go above and beyond to serve.<strong> </strong>A notable moment for me was writing my first article, <a href="https://angelflightwest.org/news/flights-of-hope-meet-afw-passenger-mark/" title="“Flights of Hope: Meet AFW Passenger Mark.”">“Flights of Hope: Meet AFW Passenger Mark.”</a> Before writing the story, I sat in on my first passenger interview, listening as Mark shared his journey—from life before his diagnosis to his ongoing fight and the care he traveled to receive. His vulnerability allowed me to tell his story in a way that honors his resilience while highlighting the impact of AFW’s work.</p>



  <p>This role has given me the opportunity to further develop my storytelling skills through writing and publishing articles on AFW’s blog, crafting and posting social media content, and creating email campaigns that further highlight volunteer and passenger experiences. Doing so has allowed me to deepen my knowledge of platforms such as Canva, Mailchimp, and WordPress.</p>



  <p>I’ve gained a new understanding of the nonprofit sector, which has contributed to my growth both personally and professionally. It’s been a surreal experience to witness the passion and commitment that both volunteers and staff bring to fulfilling AFW’s mission. I’m incredibly grateful for the opportunity to be part of such a passionate, supportive, and inspiring community. This experience has strengthened my desire to pursue a career in the nonprofit world, and I’ll carry everything I’ve learned here with me into the future.</p>

My name is Gloriann Figueroa, and I am a Marketing and Communications Intern at Angel Flight West (AFW). I graduated with a BA in Nonprofit Management from the University of North Texas in May and have been applying my skills in a meaningful way through this internship. My background in social media, writing, and campaigning drew me to AFW, where I have gained valuable experience in nonprofit communications.

One of the highlights of my internship was writing my first article, "Flights of Hope: Meet AFW Passenger Mark," which allowed me to tell Mark's inspiring story while showcasing AFW's impact. I've enhanced my storytelling abilities by publishing articles on AFW’s blog, creating social media content, and developing email campaigns that spotlight the experiences of volunteers and passengers. This role has deepened my understanding of platforms like Canva, Mailchimp, and WordPress.

Witnessing the dedication of AFW’s volunteers and staff has been incredibly inspiring. I am grateful for my experience here, which has solidified my desire to pursue a career in the nonprofit sector and provided me with skills and insights that I will carry into my future endeavors.
