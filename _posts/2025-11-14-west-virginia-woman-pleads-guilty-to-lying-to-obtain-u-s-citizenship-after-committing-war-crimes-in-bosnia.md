A 53-year-old woman from West Virginia, Nada Radovan Tomanic, pleaded guilty on November 10 to charges of lying to obtain U.S. citizenship by concealing her involvement in war crimes committed during the Bosnian conflict in the 1990s. Tomanic, who served in the Zulfikar Special Unit of the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was involved in the abuse of Bosnian Serb civilian prisoners. In her 2012 naturalization application, she falsely denied serving in a detention facility and misrepresented her criminal history, specifically denying any involvement in serious bodily harm. During her U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services interview, she again lied under oath about her past. Tomanic has been charged with procuring citizenship contrary to law and faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, with sentencing scheduled for February 3, 2026. The case was investigated by the FBI, in coordination with the Department of Homeland Security and other international agencies, highlighting the commitment to uphold immigration integrity and address human rights violations.
