Governor Bob Ferguson took immediate action on housing, reproductive freedom, and permitting reform by signing three executive orders shortly after his inauguration on January 15, 2025. The housing order calls for state agencies to review regulations impacting housing, permitting, and construction for potential streamlining. The reproductive freedom order instructs the Department of Health to recommend strategies for protecting reproductive freedom. The permitting reform order mandates state agencies to expedite permit and license processing times. Ferguson's inaugural address urged for government reform and bipartisanship, recognizing the challenges facing the state while expressing optimism for the resilience and dynamism of Washingtonians.
