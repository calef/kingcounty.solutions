  — Following an inaugural address centered on calls for decisive action, Governor
  Bob Ferguson signed three executive orders less than an hour after taking the oath
  of office and minutes after concluding his inaugural address.\n\n**The orders direct
  agencies to take action on key issues:**\n\n- [Housing](https://governor.wa.gov/sites/default/files/exe_order/25-02%20-%20Housing%20Construction.pdf):
  The executive order directs state agencies to review all regulations that impact
  housing, permitting and construction and identify any provision that can be streamlined,
  deferred or&nbsp;eliminated.\n- [Reproductive freedom](sites/default/files/exe_order/25-01%20-%20Reproductive%20Roundtable.pdf):
  The executive order directs the&nbsp;Department of Health to convene a roundtable
  of medical&nbsp;providers, reproductive health experts and policy makers to&nbsp;recommend
  strategies for protecting reproductive freedom.\n- [Permitting reform](https://governor.wa.gov/sites/default/files/exe_order/25-03%20-%20Permit%20Fees.pdf):
  The executive order directs all state&nbsp;agencies to cut down their permit and
  license processing&nbsp;times. If an agency does not meet its deadline, it will
  refund&nbsp;the application fee.\n\n## Ferguson’s inaugural address calls for government
  reform, bipartisanship\n\nIn his address, Ferguson recognized the challenges facing
  the state, but declared his optimism based on Washington’s history and the proven
  resilience of our people.\n\nHe invoked Gov. Dan Evans’ 1965 inaugural address:
  ‘We are at this moment experiencing great challenges—challenges which test an administration,
  a legislature and a people. To meet these challenges, we cannot be leisurely when
  the times call for action.’”\n\nFerguson called on legislators to embrace the spirit
  of bipartisanship, and focus on centering the people. He cited multiple bipartisan
  proposals before the Legislature that have his support.\n\n[**Click here to read

  \"Inaugural Address, January 15, 2025\")\n\n### Key quotes:\n\n- “Despite these,
  and other challenges, I’m optimistic. I know that together we can make real progress
  and increase opportunities for Washingtonians. Now I admit to being a glass half
  full kind of guy. But my optimism is warranted for three reasons. First, Washingtonians
  are among the most resilient, dynamic and innovative people in the world. Second,
  they are represented by dedicated legislators from diverse backgrounds united by
  a common commitment to help improve our state. And third, Washington’s history demonstrates,
  over and over again, that we rise to the challenges placed in our path.”\n- Let
  us listen to one another, without consideration for party, so that the strongest
  argument prevails. That is how we do our best work.”\n- “As your Governor, I will
  continue this focus on measurable, and ambitious, goals. I will have a bias for
  action.”\n- “I’m in politics because I believe in the power of government to improve
  people’s lives. At the same time, we must recognize government does not always meet
  that promise. So let me be clear: I’m not here to defend government. I’m here to
  reform it.”\n- “And speaking of Presidents, let me be very clear — my administration
  will work with President Trump where we can. We will stand up to him when we must.
  That most certainly includes protecting Washingtonians’ reproductive freedom.”\n-
  “Our mission must be to speed up government, improve customer service and center
  the people in every decision we make.”\n- “We also must make Washington State more
  affordable in other ways…To that end, I am excited to work with Senator Riccelli
  and Representative Berg on legislation to ensure that every student attending K-12
  public schools receives free breakfast and lunch as part of their basic education.
  Right now, if you’re a single parent working full time making 19 bucks an hour,
  your child doesn’t qualify for free meals. That’s unacceptable. That needs to change.
  This will improve learning for kids, and save time and money for working parents.”\n-
  “In his 1965 inaugural address, Governor Evans provided us a roadmap to solving
  our challenges. He said: &nbsp;‘This administration is not frightened by the word
  liberal, nor is it ashamed of the word conservative. It does not believe that the
  words ‘fiscal responsibility’ are old fashioned nor will it ever fear to spend money
  if money needs to be spent.’”\n\n### Recognizing bipartisan legislative proposals:\n\n-
  “Representative Connors — I am excited to work with you to get your Homes for Heroes
  legislation to my desk. Let’s recognize the contributions of police officers, firefighters,
  behavioral health professionals and other critical public servants and ensure they
  can access low-interest loans to purchase their first homes.”\n- “Representative
  Davis — You’ve developed a robust and balanced package to improve public safety.
  I look forward to assisting you in this important work.”\n- “Representative Dent
  — Thank you for joining me for lunch at the Palace Cafe in Ellensburg. I share your
  commitment to supporting Washington farmers. By the way, that includes ensuring
  they receive the rebates they were promised under the Climate Commitment Act.”\n-
  “Representatives Santos and Callan — Thank you for stepping up to work on addressing
  the youth mental health crisis.”\n- “Senator Braun — l hope to work with you to
  adopt reasonable limits on the Governor’s emergency powers. We can do that together.”\n-
  “Representative Reed — Your proposal to ensure that every Washingtonian with a 3.0
  GPA receives automatic acceptance into many of our exceptional state institutions
  of higher education should be adopted by this Legislature. And I look forward to
  signing it.”\n- “Senator Holy — Thank you for your legislation proposing a $100
  million grant program to help local law enforcement agencies hire more well-trained
  officers to improve public safety. That idea was a cornerstone of my campaign for
  Governor. Any budget I sign must include this funding.”\n- “Representative Mena
  — I support your legislation prohibiting the National Guard from other states from
  coming into Washington to advance any president’s agenda without our permission.
  Texas and Montana have adopted similar policies. Washington must join them.”\n\n![Speech](https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/fancy_images/WAGOV/2025/01/10870130/5943466/dsc07736_crop.jpg)"
