Frank, a veteran who served in the Air Force and was embedded with the Army during the Iraq campaign, faced significant challenges after returning home. Despite initially pursuing a career as a veterinary technician, he struggled with unresolved PTSD, leading to a downward spiral that included health deterioration and homelessness. After years of hardship, Frank found healing in Seattle, where he now works at Compass Housing Alliance's Blaine Veterans Center. There, he assists other veterans experiencing homelessness, drawing from his own experiences to provide support. Frank emphasizes the importance of self-acceptance and coping with one's challenges to move forward. His journey took a significant turn when he was recognized with the “Honoring Our Heroes” award by Boeing and the Seattle Seahawks, culminating in a moment where he and his colleagues will hold the U.S. flag during the national anthem at Lumen Field. This recognition symbolizes his transition from serving his country, navigating personal struggles, to now helping fellow veterans find their way.
