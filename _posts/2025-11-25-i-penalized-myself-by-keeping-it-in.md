  <p>Frank enlisted in the Air Force in 2004 at age 21. He served as an aircraft technician before being embedded with the Army during the Iraq campaign from 2007-2010. After six years of service, he returned home with an honorable discharge—and challenges he didn&#8217;t talk about. &#8220;I penalized myself by keeping it in,&#8221; Frank reflects.</p>



  <p>Frank pursued his passion, studying Animal Science and landing his dream job as a veterinary technician. For a while, it worked. Until it didn&#8217;t. The physical demands became overwhelming, and unresolved PTSD affected his ability to cope. He had to walk away from the career he&#8217;d fought so hard to build.</p>



  <p>What followed was a spiral: His health deteriorated. Relationships fractured. Twice, Frank found himself homeless. The Veteran who once served in a war zone now struggled to keep himself afloat.</p>



  <p>After years of struggle, Frank made his way to Seattle and found a pathway toward healing. Today, he works the night shift at Compass Housing Alliance&#8217;s Blaine Veterans Center, helping veterans experiencing homelessness navigate challenges he knows intimately.</p>



  <p>His approach is rooted in hard-won wisdom. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be ashamed of who you are,&#8221; Frank tells veterans. &#8220;Acknowledge who you are. Learn to cope with it, so that you can move forward.&#8221; In helping others fight battles similar to his own, Frank discovered something unexpected: &#8220;By working here and working with these veterans, I am helping myself as much as I am helping them.&#8221;</p>



  <p>On November 9th, Frank&#8217;s purpose took center stage when Boeing and the Seattle Seahawks recognized Compass Housing Alliance with the &#8220;Honoring Our Heroes&#8221; award.

Frank, a veteran who served in the Air Force and was embedded with the Army during the Iraq campaign, faced significant challenges after returning home. Despite initially pursuing a career as a veterinary technician, he struggled with unresolved PTSD, leading to a downward spiral that included health deterioration and homelessness. After years of hardship, Frank found healing in Seattle, where he now works at Compass Housing Alliance's Blaine Veterans Center. There, he assists other veterans experiencing homelessness, drawing from his own experiences to provide support. Frank emphasizes the importance of self-acceptance and coping with one's challenges to move forward. His journey took a significant turn when he was recognized with the “Honoring Our Heroes” award by Boeing and the Seattle Seahawks, culminating in a moment where he and his colleagues will hold the U.S. flag during the national anthem at Lumen Field. This recognition symbolizes his transition from serving his country, navigating personal struggles, to now helping fellow veterans find their way.
