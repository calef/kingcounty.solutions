Westside Neighbors Shelter will open for overnight stays on November 22, implementing new operational changes and a partnership with the Burien Severe Weather Shelter (BSWS), operated by Highline United Methodist Church. BSWS has provided trained overnight shelter staff during severe weather events for the past seven winters. This season, the shelter will accommodate only thirty-five individuals each night, increasing to 45 during severe weather as per King County regulations. Cots will be assigned on a first-come, first-served basis, with a waitlist for additional requests. Dinner will be offered to those staying overnight, while the warm-up center will provide breakfast and welcome clients from 7 to 11 am daily. The partnership with BSWS and community support is acknowledged and appreciated.
