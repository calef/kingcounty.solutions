Canopy Apartments in White Center is an affordable housing development aimed at fostering community and providing high-quality living spaces for families. The initiative addresses rising housing costs and the lack of new affordable apartments in the region. In collaboration with the White Center Community Development Association (CDA), Community Roots began this project, which includes both housing and a family resource center. The development, which broke ground in 2024, will feature the White Center HUB, a center offering services from organizations like Southwest Youth and Family Services and HealthPoint, alongside amenities such as a coffee shop, recording studio, and playground.

The Canopy Apartments will provide 76 new affordable units, including 59 family-sized apartments with two to four bedrooms, aimed at households earning between 30% and 60% of the area median income. As of now, installation of cabinets, countertops, and appliances is ongoing, with drywall and painting in progress at the HUB. The project is set to open in October, with applications for housing expected to be available in August.
