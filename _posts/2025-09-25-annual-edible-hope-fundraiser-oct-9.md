Join the Edible Hope Kitchen for its annual fall fundraiser on Thursday, October 9, 2025, from 6-8 PM at Old Stove Brewery in Ballard. This event aims to raise funds to support the mission of providing nutritious meals to those in need, with over 40,000 meals served each year. Last year, the fundraiser attracted over 160 attendees, raising more than $85,000. Guests can enjoy a hearty dinner donated by local restaurants and drinks from Old Stove Brewery. The evening will include raffle items, a silent auction, and a Raise-the-Paddle auction, with all proceeds going directly to the kitchen's efforts. Community members are encouraged to volunteer, visit for breakfast or coffee, or participate in monthly giving to help ensure a warm meal is always available for those who need it. Everyone is welcome to attend, and it’s a great opportunity to connect with friends, family, and the community while supporting hunger relief efforts.
