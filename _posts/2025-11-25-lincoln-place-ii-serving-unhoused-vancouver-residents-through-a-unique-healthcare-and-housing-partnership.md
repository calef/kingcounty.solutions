Lincoln Place II has officially opened in Vancouver, offering 40 units of affordable housing aimed at supporting individuals exiting homelessness and facing chronic health challenges. This property is part of the Apple Health and Homes Initiative (AHAH), a program under the Washington State Department of Commerce. The project received funding from the Housing Trust Fund and $493,000 from the Connecting Housing to Infrastructure Program to enhance waterworks infrastructure. The Vancouver Housing Authority (VHA) collaborated with the state Health Care Authority and the Department of Social and Health Services to oversee the development and management of permanent supportive housing, ensuring affordability for residents. Since 2022, AHAH has allocated $139 million for similar projects, resulting in 22 new properties that will house 1,304 individuals in need. VHA emphasizes the importance of supportive services to help residents maintain stable housing, adopting a trauma-informed care approach and harm reduction strategies. Residents of Lincoln Place II will have access to various services, including employment assistance, educational opportunities, substance abuse support, financial training, and connections to community resources, all designed to empower them and improve their quality of life.
