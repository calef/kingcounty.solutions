LIHI is relocating Rosie’s Village, a tiny house village previously situated in the University District, to a new site at 12201 Aurora Ave N. This relocation is necessary to prepare for new affordable housing developments. The new village will consist of 37 tiny houses and will feature 24/7 staffing, a community kitchen, bathrooms, laundry facilities, offices for case managers, staff parking, and a security pavilion. Sponsored by Truevine of Holiness Missionary Baptist Church, Rosie’s Village will function as an enhanced shelter, aiming to provide pathways to permanent housing for 40-50 unsheltered individuals. Support services will include assistance with obtaining identification, employment, and healthcare. The location offers convenient access to public transport and nearby amenities. Rosie’s Village is set to open in June 2025.

Meanwhile, Kingfisher Village, under construction at 1824 S. 84th St. in Tacoma, will feature 60 tiny houses and accommodate 70-75 individuals. Scheduled to open in summer 2025, Kingfisher will operate as a 24/7 enhanced shelter in partnership with Pierce County and the Department of Commerce. The long-term vision includes developing the site into affordable housing, similar to previous tiny house village transformations.
