This article presents a recipe for Cornbread Crumble, adapted from Laura Pyles, and shared by Brynne Irish in partnership with the Pantry. The recipe yields about 4 cups and includes the following ingredients: 6 ounces of all-purpose flour, 6 ounces of cornmeal, 1 tablespoon of baking powder, 1 1/4 teaspoons of kosher salt, 3 ounces of sugar, 3 eggs, 3/4 cup of vegetable oil, 1/2 cup of whole milk, and 1/2 cup of buttermilk.

To prepare the cornbread crumble, preheat the oven to 350°F. In one bowl, whisk the dry ingredients together and set aside. In a stand mixer, whip the sugar and eggs until fluffy, gradually adding the vegetable oil, followed by the milk and buttermilk. Next, combine the dry ingredients with the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Pour the batter into a greased 1/4 sheet or an 8x8” pyrex dish and bake for 20 minutes, or until golden brown. After cooling slightly, crumble the cornbread onto a parchment-lined sheet tray and return to the oven to bake the crumbles until crispy and golden, approximately 15 minutes more.
