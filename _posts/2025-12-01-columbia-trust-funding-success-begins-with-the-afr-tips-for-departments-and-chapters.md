  One of DAV’s greatest strengths is helping veterans with world-class services no matter where they are in the country.

  This network of support comes from our benefits advocates—our national service officers—spread throughout the country.

  We also see it in what you, our members, do for veterans—food pantries, medical equipment distribution, the DAV Transportation Network, chapter outreach events and more.

  These initiatives succeed because they’re organized and run by you. As members and citizens of your community, you know your areas and your veterans better than anyone; what’s needed in rural Iowa is different than downtown Pittsburgh. The challenges in Montana are different than Florida.

  Addressing local needs with local solutions makes sense.

  But when a good initiative faces financial challenges, help is available through the DAV National Service Foundation’s Columbia Trust. This trust focuses resources where they’re needed most.

  It’s a powerful resource.

  But as French philosopher Voltaire (and also Spider-Man’s uncle) said: With great power comes great responsibility.

  This money isn’t automatically distributed. Every year in April, the Foundation begins accepting applications from chapters and departments for the Columbia Trust. These requests are verified, vetted and validated by the Foundation’s board of directors. (You can learn more about that process [here](https://nsf.dav.org/columbia-trust/questions-answers/).)

  A department or chapter in need that’s **in good standing** can receive funds to carry out its initiatives if the board approves the request.

  Those initiatives are your “great power.” You know the veterans’ needs in your area, you know how to meet those needs, and—with funding and a charter—you have the means and support to carry out those initiatives in DAV’s name.

  “In good standing” is where your great responsibility comes in—and where we need to take a deeper look.

  Whether you’re a department or chapter leader now or a member-at-large, the following information can be of benefit to you.

  **In good standing**

  When it comes to requesting Columbia Trust funds, the application that spells out the need and your plan is only one point of consideration for the Foundation’s board.

  They also verify whether your department or chapter needs the funds and is in good standing. That’s determined by reviewing your department or chapter’s most recent Annual Financial Report (AFR).

  The AFR is one of the most important documents your department or chapter must submit to national headquarters. It’s a detailed financial picture that accounts for all your assets and expenses. (If you have any questions about what those assets or expenses are, the [AFR Instructions](https://www.dav.org/wp-content/uploads/Annual_Financial_Report_Kit.pdf) provide excellent definitions.) It also shows our donors and partners that DAV’s resources are managed responsibly nationwide.

  As its name indicates, the AFR is due annually after the financial reporting year ends on June 30. The final submission deadline is Sept. 30. Anything submitted later means your department or chapter will have its charter suspended and be deemed not in good standing.

  When a charter is suspended, the Columbia Trust grant request process halts, potentially jeopardizing the programs and services you provide veterans in your area.

  **Don’t fret**

  Filing an AFR isn’t just about paperwork—it’s how we demonstrate accountability and protect DAV’s ability to serve veterans nationwide. We (and the IRS) need to see how funds are managed to ensure they align with our mission and that we’re being good stewards of donations.

  Yes, a cursory look through the AFR instructions may make the accounting seem daunting or overwhelming.

  But there’s hope. Implementing a few simple habits and routines will make filing the AFR go much smoother:

  - **<u>Create and review a budget</u>** – Creating a budget makes you think through what you plan on spending your money on.

Columbia Trust funding success is closely linked to the Annual Fund Report (AFR), which serves as a crucial tool for departments and chapters. Departments are encouraged to personalize their AFR submissions to highlight their unique contributions and successes, showcasing how funding has positively impacted their programs. This personalization allows for a compelling narrative that resonates with potential donors.

To maximize funding potential, departments should clearly articulate the need for support and how specific contributions can make a difference. Utilizing storytelling and data can enhance the appeal, providing a clear picture of the organization’s goals and achievements. Additionally, maintaining consistent communication with donors and stakeholders is essential for fostering relationships and encouraging ongoing support.

Departments and chapters are advised to collaborate with their teams to gather impactful stories and statistics that demonstrate their effectiveness. By effectively communicating their mission and the importance of funding, organizations can increase their chances of securing financial support from the Columbia Trust. Emphasizing success stories and the tangible outcomes of previous funding can significantly influence donor engagement and commitment to future contributions.
