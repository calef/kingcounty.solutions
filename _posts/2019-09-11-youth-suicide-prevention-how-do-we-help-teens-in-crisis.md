original_content: "**Seattle, WA** – Suicide is in the news a lot these days, and
  it’s no wonder – overall suicide rates in the US have increased 30% between 1999
  and 2016, according to the [Center for Disease Control](https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/suicide/)
  (CDC 2018). Our youth are no exception. The [2018 Washington Healthy Youth Survey](http://www.askhys.net/FactSheets)
  reported that 32% of 8<sup>th</sup> graders, 40% of 10<sup>th</sup> graders, and
  41% of 12<sup>th</sup> graders experienced depressive feelings within the past year,
  and 13% of 8<sup>th</sup> graders, 15% of 10<sup>th</sup> graders, and 16% of 12<sup>th</sup>
  graders reported that they felt they had no adults to turn to when they felt sad
  or hopeless (Washington HYS 2019). Additionally, 10% of students in 8<sup>th</sup>
  and 10<sup>th</sup> grade, and 9% of students in 12<sup>th</sup> grade attempted
  suicide. Many youth don’t feel comfortable talking with an adult about challenges
  they are facing. Crisis Connections hopes to fill this gap by offering youth-friendly
  connection, support, and resources through their program: Teen Link.\n\nYouth are
  more likely to talk with a peer about challenges they are facing, and Teen Link
  encourages young people to talk it out through a phone and chat line. What makes
  Teen Link so unique from other lines is that it offers a peer-support program for
  teens, by teens. Young people between the ages 13 and 21 can connect with a youth
  volunteer from 6-10pm every evening. These volunteers receive training so that they
  are equipped to offer a compassionate ear for someone having a bad day, as well
  as handle crises such as suicidal feelings, domestic violence, and other serious
  challenges. Mentors are always available to these volunteers for support, and they
  are never alone to face these calls by themselves.\n\nIn an effort to keep the program
  youth-driven and reflective of who teens are today, Crisis Connections consulted
  their teen volunteers, Teen Link staff, and community partners to refresh the Teen
  Link brand. “The youth population is dynamic, and it is important to stay abreast
  of changes in youth culture, trends, and important issues that affect youth,” says
  Dipti Chrastka, the Senior Clinical Director of Crisis Connections. “Their priorities
  all are evolving and changing rapidly. The branding that was done 5 or 10 years
  ago is no longer as relevant and needed to be updated.”\n\nCrisis Connections is
  excited to launch a brand new look and a brand new website for Teen Link: [www.teenlink.org](http://www.teenlink.org).
  The new site offers support and information catered specifically to challenges youth
  face today. According to Chrastka, “Teen Link is a very critical resource in lives
  of young people and could be the only avenue of support for some youth. It can be
  the hub of all things youth, such as resources, connections, and support.”\n\nWhile
  Teen Link is fundamentally a peer-to-peer support line that focuses on teens, the
  new branding also enables Crisis Connections to engage important suicide prevention
  training programs they offer in schools, as well as guidance for adults who are
  supporting teens.\n\n“Being willing to listen to the youth voice and perspective
  is very important,” says Chrastka. The message we can give youth is that they are
  an important part of the social fabric and what they think, feel, and want should
  be heard. Having youth representation, involving them in planning, sharing feedback
  should inform decisions and policies.”\n\nCrisis Connections and Teen Link are working
  hard to offer crisis prevention, intervention, and postvention services for youth
  so that ultimately, as a community, individuals and families can be better cared
  for before a crisis, in the moment, and after a crisis.\n\nIf you or a loved one
  are experiencing suicidal thoughts, or are struggling with difficult feelings, please

Crisis Connections, in response to rising US suicide rates, offers a youth support program called Teen Link. The program, aimed at youths aged between 13 and 21, provides a platform for them to connect with trained peer volunteers every evening. Teen Link stands out due to its peer-support structure and its focus on key issues youths face today. Crisis Connections has recently updated the Teen Link brand, including a fresh website, to better represent and address the evolving needs of the modern youth population. The initiative also includes suicide prevention programs in schools and resources for adults supporting teens.
