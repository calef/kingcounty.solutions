A federal grand jury in Washington, D.C. indicted Guanhua Su, a 37-year-old Hong Kong businessman, for his involvement in a conspiracy to submit false investment adviser forms to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Su and his co-conspirators allegedly created at least 10 shell companies, misleadingly presenting them as legitimate financial advisers. Two of these entities, Bluesky Eagle Capital Management and Wisdom Capital Management Group, were used to entice retail investors through social media and WhatsApp, promoting stock of a NASDAQ-listed public company. Investors were promised exorbitant returns of 300-500% and assurances of compensation for any losses. Ultimately, the stock price collapsed by approximately 88%, leading to substantial investor losses, with total proceeds from sales reaching $211 million. Su faces charges of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and making false statements, with potential penalties of up to five years in prison per charge. The SEC has also filed civil actions against several entities involved in the scheme. The investigation was conducted by the SEC Office of Inspector General, with support from various financial regulatory bodies. An indictment is a formal accusation, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty.
