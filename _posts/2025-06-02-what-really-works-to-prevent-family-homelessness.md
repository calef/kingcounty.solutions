original_content: "<p class=\"\">At Mary’s Place, we believe that no child should
  sleep outside, and every child deserves a warm bed, a stable home, and a chance
  to thrive. We have committed to a three-pronged approach of&nbsp;emergency shelter,&nbsp;mobile
  outreach, and prevention to end family homelessness. </p><p class=\"\">Today, as
  family homelessness in King County is at crisis levels, <strong>homelessness&nbsp;prevention
  has emerged as one of the most urgent and impactful tools to protect families and
  their futures.</strong> We know that there is no safe level of homelessness for
  children—that’s why we’re investing deeply in prevention—because keeping families
  in their hard-won homes is one of the most powerful and cost-efficient ways to end
  homelessness.</p><p class=\"\">The heartbreaking reality is that our family shelters
  in King County are full. Every day, the emergency family intake line receives 50-60
  calls from families looking for a safe place to come inside. Sadly, we can only
  offer a shelter placement to just one or two. That means dozens of families—many
  with babies and toddlers—are left outside, sleeping in cars and tents. We can’t
  meet this growing need by building more shelters – we need to stop the flow of families
  into homelessness.</p><p class=\"\">A recent panel discussion in September 2024
  brought together our partners from <a href=\"https://destinationhomesv.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Destination:
  Home</strong></a> in Santa Clara County and the <a href=\"https://leo.nd.edu/\"
  target=\"_blank\"><strong>Lab for Economic Opportunities (LEO)</strong></a> at the
  University of Notre Dame to talk about what we’ve learned about homelessness prevention
  programs so far, and where we’re going to build a system that works for families
  here in King County. <em>You can watch the full, recorded, discussion posted at
  the end of this recap!</em></p><p class=\"sqsrte-large\"><strong>Learning from Santa
  Clara County</strong></p><p class=\"\">In 2017, <a href=\"https://destinationhomesv.org\"
  target=\"_blank\"><strong>Destination: Home</strong></a>, a Silicon Valley-based
  nonprofit organization, helped launch the Homelessness Prevention System that has
  since been adopted by Santa Clara County, CA. Their innovative system serves as
  an evidence-based model proving just how impactful prevention can be in ending homelessness.
  Their story is inspiring—and familiar as we look at the current crisis here at home.</p><p
  class=\"\">Like King County, Santa Clara County saw homelessness rising, even as
  supportive housing expanded. Rents were soaring—up 12% in just 18 months—and most
  folks were paying more than half their income on housing. In fact, more than half
  of those seeking help were 100% rent-burdened. <em>“On paper, we don’t know how
  they’re surviving,”&nbsp;</em>shares Chief Program Officer Chad Bojorquez.</p><p
  class=\"\">So, they got to work. In 2017, Destination: Home, with support from private
  funders, launched a networked system of 20 nonprofits, coordinated by Sacred Heart
  Community Service, to do “whatever it takes” to keep their neighbors in their homes.</p><p
  class=\"\">These previously siloed organizations pooled their knowledge and resources,
  removing the red tape to create a far more equitable and impactful system.<em> “We
  learned early on you can't have arbitrary caps on the amount or duration of assistance
  if you truly want to wrap around a family or individual and meet their needs,” </em>shares
  Chad, <em>“data from programs nationwide that provide a capped amount of rental
  assistance, once per year, has shown this approach isn’t effective in keeping people
  stable. Sometimes, a family has spent every penny on rent and needs assistance to
  pay their other bills. Perhaps a parent had a sick child and a broken-down car within
  the same year. Our flexible approach allows us to get people the help they need
  to remain stable.”</em></p><p class=\"\">Chad shared a handful of key ingredients
  for Santa Clara County’s success with prevention: </p><ul data-rte-list=\"default\"><li><p
  class=\"\"><strong>Flexible financial assistance</strong>: Instead of imposing arbitrary
  caps or once-per-year limits on returning for assistance, their system helps with
  what a family truly needs, when they need it—whether it’s back rent, car repairs,
  or utility bills.</p></li><li><p class=\"\"><strong>Equitable access and coordinated
  effort</strong>: By bringing 20 nonprofits under one coordinated umbrella, people
  can be served based on&nbsp;their needs, not their ZIP code or affiliation with
  a specific nonprofit. </p></li><li><p class=\"\"><strong>Public sector buy-in</strong>:
  What started as a privately funded pilot serving 200 households in its first year
  has evolved into a well-oiled system, now serving&nbsp;<strong>1,700 new households
  annually</strong>, with&nbsp;<strong>sustainable funding</strong>&nbsp;<strong>from
  local, state, and federal sources</strong>.</p></li></ul><p class=\"\">The proof
  is indisputable – since beginning this work in 2017, 93% of households helped through
  this system have remained stably housed, and the average cost per household is just
  $7,000.</p><p class=\"sqsrte-large\"><strong>Building a Prevention Model Here at
  Home</strong></p><p class=\"\">At Mary’s Place, we’ve been working on this too.
  Starting in 2019, we began running small, privately funded pilot programs to test
  what works. A few of these programs included:</p><ul data-rte-list=\"default\"><li><p
  class=\"\">A monthly rent subsidy pilot where families could save what they ended
  up not spending on rent and cash out at the end of the program.</p></li><li><p class=\"\">Emergency
  rental assistance at the beginning of the pandemic for families who didn’t receive
  federal aid. In 2021, we scaled up our efforts with federal COVID-relief dollars
  through King County, partnering with the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs, Community Passageways,
  and Eastside Legal Assistance Program to identify families who needed help the most.
  We helped 370 families with $4.2 million in rental assistance, averaging around
  $1,500 per household.</p></li><li><p class=\"\">Rental support for families with
  medical needs, substance use challenges, and more, who previously stayed in a Mary’s
  Place shelter.</p></li></ul><p class=\"\">What we’re seeing post-COVID in King County
  is striking: the&nbsp;<strong>new normal</strong>&nbsp;<strong>for families is paying&nbsp;70–80%
  of their income on rent</strong>. For a single parent earning $20–25 per hour (approximately
  30–40% of the region’s Area Median Income, or AMI),&nbsp;<strong>one sick child,
  a car breakdown, or a rent increase</strong>&nbsp;<strong>can unravel everything.</strong>
  And once a family begins missing payments, the avalanche of late fees, legal notices,
  and fear of losing their home sets in.</p><p class=\"\">We know that homelessness
  takes a toll on children, in particular. When a family doesn’t have stable housing,
  it often means that children are moving around frequently, which can make it challenging
  for them to keep up in school or stay connected with friends and teachers. It’s
  also stressful—not knowing where you’ll sleep at night or if you’ll have enough
  to eat can cause a lot of anxiety and sadness, often leading to behavioral issues
  and long-term mental wellness challenges. Without regular access to essentials like
  healthy food, safe and stable spaces to play, or even basic healthcare, it’s tough
  for kids to grow and thrive as they should.</p><p class=\"\">In response, we’ve
  gone even further with our prevention efforts, partnering with the Lab for Economic
  Opportunities (LEO) at the University of Notre Dame to deepen our understanding
  of effective programs.</p><p class=\"\">The team at LEO previously<strong> </strong>worked
  with Destination: Home to conduct a groundbreaking study that followed what happened
  to individuals who received flexible financial assistance—and what happened to those
  who didn’t.</p><p class=\"\">The results were clear:&nbsp;<strong>even a few thousand
  dollars in assistance significantly improved housing stability</strong>&nbsp;and
  helped families avoid more traumatic and expensive outcomes like emergency shelter.</p><p
  class=\"\">Now, we’re partnering with LEO in a four-year study to study two types
  of prevention programs to answer the question:<strong> <em>how do we best deliver
  prevention?</em></strong><em> </em>A traditional model with one-time assistance
  equivalent to about two months of rent, and a flexible model with a higher assistance
  cap, where families can come back if they need more help.</p><p class=\"\">“What
  we’re primarily asking is simple,” says David Phillips, Research Professor of Economics
  at LEO, “What works best? How much difference does it make when families can get
  the help they need—not just once, but whenever they need it?”</p><p class=\"\">Our
  study with LEO is also unique because it's targeting households that are at the
  highest risk—those who’ve already experienced homelessness or needed housing support
  before. We know previous homelessness is the strongest predictor of future homelessness,
  so we’re asking: <em>“What if we focused our most flexible, responsive resources
  on the families who need it most? Can we disrupt that cycle?”</em></p><p class=\"sqsrte-large\"><strong>Is
  Prevention a Viable Solution for the Family Homelessness Crisis in King County?</strong></p><p
  class=\"\">&nbsp;Here’s what our data shows so far:</p><ul data-rte-list=\"default\"><li><p
  class=\"\">The average family Mary’s Place serves has 3.5 people (plus pets!)</p></li><li><p
  class=\"\">A 90-day shelter stay costs $23,000 for the average family</p></li><li><p
  class=\"\">With the severe lack of affordable housing for families and rising cost
  of living in King County, average shelter stays are doubling to just over six months,
  and costs are increasing </p></li></ul><p class=\"\">Compare that to prevention:</p><ul

---

Mary's Place is dedicated to preventing family homelessness in King County, where the crisis has reached alarming levels. Their strategy includes emergency shelter, mobile outreach, and a strong focus on prevention. With family shelters filled to capacity, they receive 50-60 calls daily from families in need, but can only accommodate a fraction. The organization has been inspired by a successful model from Santa Clara County, which integrated 20 nonprofits to provide flexible, needs-based financial assistance. Since implementing their system, 93% of those helped have remained stably housed.

Mary's Place initiated various pilot programs starting in 2019, including rent subsidies and emergency assistance during the pandemic, resulting in support for 370 families with $4.2 million in aid. The current financial strain on families is severe, with many spending 70-80% of their income on rent. By partnering with the Lab for Economic Opportunities, they aim to refine their prevention programs, focusing on households at high risk of homelessness. Early findings suggest that prevention is significantly more cost-effective than shelter, preserving dignity and stability for families. The goal remains clear: to ensure no child sleeps outside.
