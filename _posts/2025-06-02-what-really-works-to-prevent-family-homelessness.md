Mary's Place is dedicated to preventing family homelessness in King County, where the crisis has reached alarming levels. Their strategy includes emergency shelter, mobile outreach, and a strong focus on prevention. With family shelters filled to capacity, they receive 50-60 calls daily from families in need, but can only accommodate a fraction. The organization has been inspired by a successful model from Santa Clara County, which integrated 20 nonprofits to provide flexible, needs-based financial assistance. Since implementing their system, 93% of those helped have remained stably housed.

Mary's Place initiated various pilot programs starting in 2019, including rent subsidies and emergency assistance during the pandemic, resulting in support for 370 families with $4.2 million in aid. The current financial strain on families is severe, with many spending 70-80% of their income on rent. By partnering with the Lab for Economic Opportunities, they aim to refine their prevention programs, focusing on households at high risk of homelessness. Early findings suggest that prevention is significantly more cost-effective than shelter, preserving dignity and stability for families. The goal remains clear: to ensure no child sleeps outside.
