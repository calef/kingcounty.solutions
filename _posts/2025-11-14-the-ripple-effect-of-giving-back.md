  <p><span data-contrast="auto">Founded in 1961, Pilot|RB worked alongside nonprofits since its earliest days in the group insurance industry. As a part of NFP, they will continue with that strong commitment. For Ben and his brother, Josh Senders, also a </span><span data-contrast="auto">Senior Vice President</span><span data-contrast="auto"> at NFP, giving back is woven into their family’s legacy. </span><span data-ccp-props="{}"> </span></p>

Giving back to the community creates a ripple effect that benefits both the giver and the recipient. Acts of kindness, whether through volunteering or donating, foster a sense of connection and purpose. These actions not only support those in need but also enhance the well-being of the givers, leading to improved mental health and increased happiness.

Research shows that helping others can boost self-esteem and provide a sense of fulfillment. Engaging in community service can also cultivate new skills and relationships, expanding social networks and creating a stronger community fabric. Moreover, when individuals witness the positive impact of their contributions, they are often inspired to continue giving, perpetuating a cycle of generosity.

Organizations that promote volunteerism report higher employee satisfaction and lower turnover rates. Companies that encourage their employees to participate in community service often see improvements in teamwork and morale. This interconnectedness between giving back and personal growth contributes to a more compassionate society, where the collective effort leads to significant societal improvements. Ultimately, the act of giving back not only transforms individual lives but also strengthens communities, illustrating the profound power of altruism.
