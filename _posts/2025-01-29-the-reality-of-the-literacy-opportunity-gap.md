In the U.S., 45 million people are functionally illiterate, often due to a lack of adequate literacy instruction during critical learning periods. Oliver James, a former functionally illiterate individual, exemplifies the struggle faced by many; he documented his journey to literacy through self-teaching. Low literacy rates are linked to high unemployment, with one in six adults lacking basic skills. Students without strong reading abilities by fourth grade are less likely to graduate high school, often contributing to the school-to-prison pipeline, where 85% of youth offenders struggle with literacy. Socioeconomic factors exacerbate this issue; schools in low-income areas are typically underfunded and lack resources, disproportionately affecting Black and Brown students. The consequences of low literacy extend beyond education, impacting healthcare access and perpetuating cycles of poverty. Functional illiteracy costs the U.S. economy approximately $428 billion annually, primarily due to reduced job prospects and increased social welfare dependence. Previous reforms, like the No Child Left Behind Act, aimed to address literacy gaps but often prioritized test scores over genuine skill development. Organizations like Reading Partners are working to bridge the literacy gap by providing targeted support and resources to students in need.
