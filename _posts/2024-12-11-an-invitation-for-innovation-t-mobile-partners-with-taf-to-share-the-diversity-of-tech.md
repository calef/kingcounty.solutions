T-Mobile recently hosted students from TAF@Saghalie at its 5G Tech Hub, providing them with an opportunity to explore tech labs and learn about the company's innovative research. As a leader in the 5G space, T-Mobile aims to inspire the next generation of tech innovators. Neeta Moodbidri, a senior director at T-Mobile, emphasized the importance of showcasing diversity in the tech industry, highlighting that there are various career paths beyond coding and engineering. The students engaged with professionals of color across different fields, gaining insights into the technology that powers 5G and how various components work together.

The visit culminated in a Q&A panel with T-Mobile leaders, addressing topics like resilience in tech and the importance of mentorship. T-Mobile's commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) is seen as a competitive advantage, with research suggesting that companies focused on DEI perform better financially. Such corporate partnerships are vital for exposing students to STEM opportunities and fostering meaningful experiences that inspire future careers. The initiative aligns with TAF's project-based learning model, encouraging students to engage with real-world issues and develop skills necessary for success in the tech sector.
