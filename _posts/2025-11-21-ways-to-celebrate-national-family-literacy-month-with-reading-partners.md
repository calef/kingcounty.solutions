November is National Family Literacy Month, a celebration initiated by the National Center for Families Learning (NCFL) to promote education and family engagement in learning. The month encourages families to pursue educational goals together and recognize local organizations supporting literacy.

Reading Partners has expanded its family literacy programs, initially focusing on individualized tutoring, to directly assist families through partnerships. Notable initiatives include collaboration with CAP Tulsa, where parent educators were trained to conduct family literacy workshops, and with the New York City Education Department’s Family and Community Engagement (FACE), providing virtual workshops that reached more than 1,260 families. In Newark, New Jersey, workshops have engaged over 1,000 families, emphasizing inclusivity and diverse learning environments. Families participating in these workshops receive books and gift cards to enhance their home libraries.

Additionally, Reading Partners has launched initiatives like the Achievery, offering literacy skill videos, and a text-based service, Lantern, to provide literacy tips to families. These efforts aim to foster a supportive community for learning, making resources accessible to families across various backgrounds. Families are encouraged to join the celebration and utilize available resources to enhance their literacy skills together.
