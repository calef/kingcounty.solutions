Governor-elect Bob Ferguson has appointed Lieutenant Governor Denny Heck to lead the housing transition effort, focusing on Ferguson's housing priorities for the first 100 days of his term. The Housing Subcommittee will consist of members from Ferguson's bipartisan Transition Team and key stakeholders from across the state. The team will work on increasing housing supply, implementing permitting and zoning reforms, passing eviction reforms, and safeguarding renters from predatory rent increases. Ferguson, who has pledged to build 200,000 housing units during his term, asserts that housing affordability is a crisis in every corner of Washington state requiring immediate statewide action.
