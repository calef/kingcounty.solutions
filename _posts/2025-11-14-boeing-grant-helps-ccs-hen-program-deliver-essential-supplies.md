Catholic Community Services (CCS) has received a $50,000 grant from the Boeing Employees Community Fund Puget Sound Chapter to enhance its Housing and Essential Needs (HEN) program. This funding enabled the purchase of a new cargo van, allowing HEN to improve its delivery of essential supplies and support to individuals in King County who cannot work due to disabilities. The program currently assists over 4,000 people, providing rental and utility aid, hygiene and cleaning supplies, and ORCA Lift cards. 

The new van has already facilitated the distribution of crucial items, including hygiene products and cleaning supplies, to four program sites, replacing an aging vehicle that was costly to maintain. It will also be utilized to deliver mattresses to those transitioning from homelessness and provide essential bags to participants unable to travel due to their disabilities. Trisha Mathieu, the division director for CCS King County, emphasized that the van enhances their ability to meet client needs effectively. This initiative reflects the partnership and commitment of CCS and Boeing to fostering stronger communities.
