  <p>Catholic Community Services&nbsp;(CCS)&nbsp;is grateful to the Boeing Employees Community Fund Puget Sound Chapter for a generous $50,000 grant supporting our Housing and Essential Needs (HEN) program. This funding&nbsp;allowed HEN to&nbsp;purchase&nbsp;a new cargo van, strengthening their impact&nbsp;in&nbsp;our community and delivering supplies and support to those who need them most.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>The <a href="https://ccsww.org/services/housing-and-essential-needs-hen-king-county/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HEN</a> program supports people in King County unable to work due to temporary or permanent disability. HEN provides rental and utility assistance, hygiene and cleaning supplies, ORCA Lift cards, and other essential resources. Currently, HEN serves more than 4,000 people including over 1,800 receiving rental assistance, providing critical support for our neighbors with disabilities.   </p>

  <p>The new van&nbsp;has already helped&nbsp;HEN&nbsp;staff&nbsp;distribute&nbsp;essential items to&nbsp;four program sites throughout King County, delivering&nbsp;hygiene supplies such as shampoo, soap, and deodorant, and cleaning supplies such as&nbsp;brooms, laundry detergent, and surface cleaners. The&nbsp;previous&nbsp;van used by HEN&nbsp;was&nbsp;aging and expensive to&nbsp;maintain,&nbsp;and the purchase of the new van&nbsp;has ensured&nbsp;HEN can&nbsp;effectively&nbsp;distribute essential items&nbsp;to people across the county without&nbsp;interruption.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p>In addition to regular supply distribution to program sites, the van will also deliver mattresses to individuals who are transitioning from homelessness into housing as well as larger items such as air conditioners, heaters, or air filters that support health needs. The van will also deliver essential needs bags directly to program participants that are unable to travel to program sites due to their disability.   </p>



  <p>The purchase of a new cargo van ensures&nbsp;that the HEN program, as well as Catholic Community Services as a whole, will be able to continue these vital services and programming for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <p>&#8220;The new HEN van enables us to deliver critical essential needs to clients throughout King County, serving hundreds of clients every week! It also helps us respond quickly to evolving CCS client needs, like&nbsp;assisting&nbsp;in getting food to folks after SNAP was paused,” says Trisha&nbsp;Mathieu,&nbsp;division director for CCS King County.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p>This grant reflects the shared commitment of CCS and Boeing to building stronger, more connected communities through partnership and compassion.&nbsp;For more information about the Boeing Employees Community Fund, please visit&nbsp;their&nbsp;<a href="https://boeingbenefits.com/employee/emp-community-ecf.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official website</a>.&nbsp;</p>

Catholic Community Services (CCS) has received a $50,000 grant from the Boeing Employees Community Fund Puget Sound Chapter to enhance its Housing and Essential Needs (HEN) program. This funding enabled the purchase of a new cargo van, allowing HEN to improve its delivery of essential supplies and support to individuals in King County who cannot work due to disabilities. The program currently assists over 4,000 people, providing rental and utility aid, hygiene and cleaning supplies, and ORCA Lift cards. 

The new van has already facilitated the distribution of crucial items, including hygiene products and cleaning supplies, to four program sites, replacing an aging vehicle that was costly to maintain. It will also be utilized to deliver mattresses to those transitioning from homelessness and provide essential bags to participants unable to travel due to their disabilities. Trisha Mathieu, the division director for CCS King County, emphasized that the van enhances their ability to meet client needs effectively. This initiative reflects the partnership and commitment of CCS and Boeing to fostering stronger communities.
