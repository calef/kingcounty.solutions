La Esperanza, a family-owned grocery store on North Beacon Hill, has joined the Fresh Bucks program, allowing customers to use Fresh Bucks for purchases. This neighborhood staple has been serving the community for over a decade, providing fresh, high-quality ingredients essential to Latino cuisine, including tomatillos, nopales, yucca, plantain, papaya, and aloe. Fresh Bucks customers can now find a variety of fresh produce, dried beans, chiles, and frozen and canned fruits and vegetables at La Esperanza, supporting a locally owned business. The store operates daily from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. and is conveniently located at 2500 Beacon Ave S, just one block north of the Beacon Hill light rail station and accessible via bus lines 36, 60, and 107. Free parking is available on the north side of the building.
