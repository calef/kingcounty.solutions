  <p>“Nothing fills my cup more than seeing the impact our work at Operation Homefront has on our military and veteran families.”&nbsp;</p>



  <p><strong>WHAT MOTIVATES YOU TO GIVE BACK TO OUR MILITARY FAMILIES AND VETERANS?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>



  <p>The military has been my entire existence. Both my grandparents served in the Navy, and both my parents were drill instructors in the Marine Corps. I began talking to military recruiters in early high school and joined the Air Force after I graduated. Being medically separated after breaking both feet in multiple places was devastating. It was everything I ever wanted to do in life.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Then I became a military spouse and caregiver. I got engaged to a Marine before he deployed to Iraq in 2004. He was catastrophically wounded in 2005 on Pearl Harbor Day. We married in 2006, and I became acquainted with the military nonprofit space when I joined the ranks of military spouses and caregivers. Nonprofits filled gaps after the VA scaled back the caregiver program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p>My work with Operation Homefront is not about the path I walked, though. It’s about uplifting those who are currently going through hardships and making sure they are seen.&nbsp;</p>
