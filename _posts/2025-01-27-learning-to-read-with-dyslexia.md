Dyslexia is a learning deficit that affects language processing, making reading, spelling, and writing challenging. Students with dyslexia often struggle with remembering letter names and sounds, blending sounds, and recognizing sight words. They may substitute words while reading aloud or confuse letters that look or sound similar. Despite these difficulties, learners with dyslexia can succeed in reading through creative and individualized instruction that emphasizes their strengths. 

Effective strategies include multisensory approaches, such as using visual aids and engaging in tactile activities like letter art and sand writing. Assistive technology, such as text-to-speech software and line readers, can help students focus on smaller sections of text and reduce overwhelm. Techniques like choral reading and shared reading can enhance comprehension and engagement. 

A supportive learning environment that celebrates progress and fosters confidence is crucial. Educators and caregivers are encouraged to adopt flexible and holistic teaching methods tailored to each student's unique needs, reinforcing the idea that dyslexia offers a distinctive perspective rather than a barrier to learning.
