In 2025, significant strides were made to better manage change, data, communication, and policies. The HR's internal website was updated for easier staff access to key information and policies. Communication was enhanced by restructuring the team to have point people for each region. Programming systems updates were planned by LOPS and LISMs, laying the foundation for clearer communication. Consistent data collection for tracking program and project success was ensured by developing dashboards. In 2026, the systems will be refined with the Equity Impact Tool to ensure equity-informed decisions and policies, thus unifying, streamlining, and promoting equity in the organization.
