Youth Eastside Services is offering a new program aimed at helping middle schoolers discover their interests and passions, termed "Finding Their Vibe." This initiative is designed to assist students in navigating the challenges of adolescence and making meaningful connections with peers. The program includes various activities that encourage self-expression, creativity, and personal growth, such as workshops and group discussions. Participants will explore different hobbies and talents, allowing them to develop their identities and build confidence. 

The program emphasizes the importance of mental health, providing a supportive environment where students can share their experiences and feelings without judgment. By fostering an inclusive community, "Finding Their Vibe" aims to empower young individuals to embrace their uniqueness and find joy in their pursuits. Parents and guardians are encouraged to engage with the program to further support their children's development. 

This initiative reflects a growing recognition of the need for targeted support during the critical middle school years, as students face various social and emotional pressures. Through this program, Youth Eastside Services hopes to create a positive impact on the lives of middle schoolers, helping them thrive both personally and socially.
