As summer ends, the importance of mental and emotional readiness for students is highlighted. Taylor's journey illustrates this need. After moving to Seattle and finding stable housing, Taylor's trauma resurfaced, as unresolved issues often do when basic needs are met. Initially feeling overwhelmed and unable to hold a job due to mental health struggles and medication side effects, Taylor's situation improved after connecting with Kimberly, a therapist from Friends of Youth’s Mental and Behavioral Health Program. Through trauma-informed care techniques, Taylor began to heal, ultimately thriving academically and professionally while managing his trauma. Now living with his partner and studying Medical Administration, Taylor wishes for other youth to access similar support. Unfortunately, many face barriers to mental health care, as trauma-informed therapy is not commonly covered by insurance. This back-to-school season, donations can provide more than just school supplies; they can help offer healing and safety to young people. Feeling safe is essential for youth to reshape their identities and establish healthier relationships, emphasizing the critical need for accessible mental health resources. Support is crucial to ensure that youths like Taylor can continue receiving the care they need.
