Valley Cities Behavioral Health Care emphasizes the importance of personal experiences in providing compassionate care. Team members often draw from their own struggles with mental health or substance use to connect with and support clients facing similar challenges. John Grossman, the Director of Development, highlights how understanding their "why" helps staff remain motivated and focused on client needs.

Erica Allen, Admissions Manager, shares her journey of overcoming personal battles that inspired her to improve access to care for others. Similarly, Sofia Goff, a Substance Use Disorder Professional Trainee, transitioned from being a client to a professional after her counselor instilled hope in her recovery. John South, a Certified Peer Support Specialist, credits Valley Cities for transforming his recovery process and empowering him to help others.

The staff at Valley Cities aim to meet clients where they are, recognizing that both small victories and major breakthroughs are significant in the recovery journey. Connections formed with clients are rewarding, as exemplified by Erica's experience with a former client who regained custody of his daughter. Valley Cities remains committed to supporting individuals on their paths to recovery.
