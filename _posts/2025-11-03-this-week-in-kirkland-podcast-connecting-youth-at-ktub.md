Katelyn Mullinkin, a YES Counselor at the Kirkland Teen Union Building (KTUB), was featured on the City of Kirkland’s “This Week in Kirkland” podcast. The episode highlights the importance of KTUB as a free after-school drop-in center dedicated to teens, providing a safe space for them to socialize, learn, and access mental health support. Mullinkin emphasizes that not all teens feel comfortable seeking help in traditional settings like clinics or schools, making KTUB's informal environment crucial for accessibility.

The center offers a variety of programs shaped by youth input, including cooking classes, art sessions, and music production opportunities, fostering creativity and building trust. KTUB also focuses on leadership development, allowing teens to engage in advocacy and civic engagement. Mullinkin discusses the range of issues teens face today, including identity exploration and the impact of technology, while promoting wellness practices within the center's culture. KTUB serves as a vital resource for teens, ensuring they feel supported and connected, and is sustained by community donations that help provide essential services to those in need.
