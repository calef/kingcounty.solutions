  <p>Ahoy! The Sno-Valley Senior Center Gala &amp; Auction is coming up on Saturday, October 11 and the theme is Timeless Treasures! We are so excited to be hosting this event at The Club at Snoqualmie Ridge and have some great items to bid on, including a stay at Willows Lodge, 6-Nights in Cortona Italy, Sno-Valley Winery Tour for 10, and so much more!</p>
  <p>If you don’t attend in person, you can still come away with some great items! Many of the items are available for bid online between Monday, October 6 and Saturday, October 11. This is our most successful fundraiser of the year, and you can help us reach our goal of $75,000 raised by purchasing your tickets or registering to bid at the link: <a href="https://snovalley25.givesmart.com">https://snovalley25.givesmart.com</a>.</p>
  <p>Another way to get involved at the senior center is to join the Board of Directors! We have several members going off this year, and our nominating committee is seeking interested candidates. The time commitment includes a board meeting every other month, plus whatever other small projects or committees you might like to take on.</p>
  <p>If you are interested in contributing to and governing the implementation of Sno-Valley Senior Center’s mission to cultivate a welcoming and inclusive gathering place that supports, inspires and uplifts our Snoqualmie Valley community to lead healthy, enriched lives through participation in diverse programming, please email me at <a href="mailto:kiraa@soundgenerations.org">kiraa@soundgenerations.org</a></p>
  <p>Towards the end of August, we received notice that the Washington State Department of Revenue will start charging us tax on “Live Presentations” starting October 1. Their definition is very broad, and includes many of our paid classes and programs. We have asked for a review and exemption, but these efforts have all been turned down.</p>
  <p>In the short term, class costs will stay the same as we figure out which classes this tax applies to and how it will impact our budget. In the long term however, you may see a small increase in class costs to compensate for these additional charges. We will communicate these changes when they occur, and will continue seeking grant funding to subsidize classes. As a reminder, Sno-Valley Senior Center also offers scholarships for many of our classes and the application can be picked up from the Front Desk or a staff person.</p>
  <p>We are excited to be hosting the Annual Fall Dinner &amp; Pie<br />
  Auction on Saturday, November 22 with two seatings (4:30 &amp; 6:30pm), where you have your choice of entrées, with all the fixings. At this event you will have the chance to bid on delicious pies baked by senior center members. If you’re interested in volunteering for this event, or would like to bake and bring a pie, please email me, <a href="mailto:kiraa@soundgenerations.org">kiraa@soundgenerations.org</a>!</p>
  <p>As always, if you have questions, comments, or concerns, please call me at 425-333-4152 ext. 1 or email <a href="mailto:kiraa@soundgenerations.org">kiraa@soundgenerations.org</a>!</p>

The Sno-Valley Senior Center is preparing for its Gala & Auction on October 11, themed "Timeless Treasures," at The Club at Snoqualmie Ridge. Exciting auction items include a stay at Willows Lodge and a six-night trip to Cortona, Italy. Online bidding will be available from October 6 to October 11, with a fundraising goal of $75,000. The center is also seeking new members for its Board of Directors as several members are stepping down. Interested candidates can contribute to the center's mission of fostering an inclusive community.

Additionally, starting October 1, the Washington State Department of Revenue will impose a tax on "Live Presentations," affecting many paid classes and programs. While class prices will remain unchanged for now, some increases may be necessary in the future. The center continues to seek grants to help subsidize classes and offers scholarships for many programs.

Looking ahead, the Annual Fall Dinner & Pie Auction is scheduled for November 22, featuring two seating options and the opportunity to bid on pies made by center members. Volunteers for the event are welcomed. For questions or concerns, Kira Avery, the Executive Director, can be contacted via phone or email.
