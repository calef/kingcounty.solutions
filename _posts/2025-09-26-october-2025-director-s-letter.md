The Sno-Valley Senior Center is preparing for its Gala & Auction on October 11, themed "Timeless Treasures," at The Club at Snoqualmie Ridge. Exciting auction items include a stay at Willows Lodge and a six-night trip to Cortona, Italy. Online bidding will be available from October 6 to October 11, with a fundraising goal of $75,000. The center is also seeking new members for its Board of Directors as several members are stepping down. Interested candidates can contribute to the center's mission of fostering an inclusive community.

Additionally, starting October 1, the Washington State Department of Revenue will impose a tax on "Live Presentations," affecting many paid classes and programs. While class prices will remain unchanged for now, some increases may be necessary in the future. The center continues to seek grants to help subsidize classes and offers scholarships for many programs.

Looking ahead, the Annual Fall Dinner & Pie Auction is scheduled for November 22, featuring two seating options and the opportunity to bid on pies made by center members. Volunteers for the event are welcomed. For questions or concerns, Kira Avery, the Executive Director, can be contacted via phone or email.
