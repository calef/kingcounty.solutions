  Monday, May 5, the Field House will no longer be available for walk-in public
  access. The building will remain open for scheduled programs and activities only.
  Community members who need in-person support such as program registration or
  facility rental inquiries should visit the Activity Center at 2045 S 216th St during
  regular business hours of 8:00 am – 4:00 pm. This change is part of our broader
  effort to consolidate Parks, Recreation, Senior Services, Events, and Facility
  Rentals into a single, more unified department.</span></p>
  <p class="xmsonormal"><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif'>As
  part of this transition, you will begin to see the new department name:
  Community Enrichment Services (CES). The CES team brings together services that
  have historically operated in parallel, allowing us to better coordinate and
  deliver meaningful programs and enrichment opportunities for the community.
  While Public Safety keeps us safe and Public Works supports our infrastructure,
  CES is about connection and creating opportunities for people to engage and
  build community. We chose this name because it better reflects what this team
  actually does. CES creates the spaces, programs, and events that bring people
  together whether it’s a class, a rental, a senior lunch, or a community event.</span></p>
