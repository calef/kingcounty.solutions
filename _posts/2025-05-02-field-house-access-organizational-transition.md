title: Field House Access & Organizational Transition
topics: []
---

Effective May 5, the Field House in Des Moines will no longer allow walk-in public access, remaining open only for scheduled programs and activities. Community members needing in-person support should visit the Activity Center during business hours. This change is part of the consolidation of Parks, Recreation, Senior Services, Events, and Facility Rentals into a new department called Community Enrichment Services (CES). CES aims to enhance community connection by offering coordinated programs and events, reflecting its mission to create opportunities for engagement and community building. Contact information for CES is provided for inquiries.
