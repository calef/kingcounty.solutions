The King County Regional Homelessness Authority (KCRHA) is seeking individuals to join its Continuum of Care Board. This board plays a critical role in addressing homelessness in the region by overseeing the implementation of strategies and policies aimed at improving the local response to homelessness. Members will represent various sectors, including people with lived experience of homelessness, service providers, government, and the business community. The board meets regularly to discuss and guide the system of care for those experiencing homelessness.

Interested candidates are encouraged to apply, and applications are accepted until October 31, 2023. The KCRHA emphasizes the importance of diverse perspectives and experiences in creating effective solutions to homelessness. Individuals selected for the board will have the opportunity to contribute to meaningful change and collaborate with various stakeholders in the community. This initiative aims to strengthen the local response to homelessness and improve the quality of life for affected individuals and families in King County.
