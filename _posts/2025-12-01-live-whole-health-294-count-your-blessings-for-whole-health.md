  <p>Take a few minutes right now to reflect on a happy moment in your life that stands out for you—a memory that is still strong and has remained with you, even if it happened 10, 20 or 40 years ago. Re-experience it. Visualize the scene, hear the sounds that were around you, feel the sensations in your body. What was it about that experience that stayed with you all these years? Was gratitude part of it? What was happening that allowed you to feel grateful?</p>



  <p>Give yourself five minutes to enjoy this simple gratitude meditation:</p>
