title: Justice Department Requires RealPage to End the Sharing of Competitively Sensitive
  Information and Alignment of Pricing Among Competitors
topics:
- Shelter & Housing

The Justice Department's Antitrust Division has proposed a settlement to address claims against RealPage Inc., aimed at curbing anticompetitive practices in the rental housing market. The settlement would require RealPage to stop sharing competitively sensitive information among competitors and to make independent pricing decisions. Allegations against RealPage include its revenue management software using nonpublic data from landlords to set rental prices and possessing features that limit price decreases and align pricing among competitors. If the court approves the settlement, RealPage must cease using competitors’ sensitive information for pricing, restrict model training to old data, avoid narrow geographic pricing models, and remove features that control price decreases. RealPage will also stop conducting market surveys for sensitive information and discussing nonpublic pricing strategies in meetings. A court-appointed monitor will ensure compliance, and RealPage must cooperate with ongoing lawsuits against property management companies using its software. The proposed settlement will be published for public comment, with the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina expected to enter a final judgment afterward. RealPage is based in Richardson, Texas.
