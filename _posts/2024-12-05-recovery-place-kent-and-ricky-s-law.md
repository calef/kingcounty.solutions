Recovery Place Kent, directed by Teri Hardy, is one of four facilities in Washington state that provides involuntary treatment under Ricky's Law, which allows for the detainment of individuals with addictions who pose a risk to themselves or others. Patients can initially be held for 120 hours, with possible extensions up to 90 days following court approval. Hardy emphasizes the importance of intervening when individuals are in crisis and unable to seek help themselves. 

One client, who had a severe struggle with alcohol and drug use, recounted waking up in a hospital after a near-fatal incident. Initially upset about being civilly committed to Recovery Place Kent, he spent his first week withdrawn and angry. However, by the second week, he began to engage in treatment, and by the fourth week, he contemplated working at the facility. He expressed that he likely would not have sought treatment voluntarily and credited involuntary treatment with saving his life. After completing a 30-day program, he is now sober.
