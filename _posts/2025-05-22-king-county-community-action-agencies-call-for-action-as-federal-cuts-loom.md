King County's Community Action Agencies, including Byrd Barr Place, El Centro de la Raza, Hopelink, Multi-Service Center, Neighborhood House, and Solid Ground, are urging action to protect essential services as proposed federal budget cuts threaten their operations. These cuts, part of ongoing Congressional negotiations, could lead to drastic reductions or shutdowns of vital human services, impacting over 265,000 residents who rely on these programs annually. Proposed budget changes include a 10% cut to the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, a 20% cut to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and significant reductions to Medicaid, potentially stripping health coverage from over 270,000 residents in Washington.

The agencies emphasize that these cuts could exacerbate poverty and food insecurity in King County, where a single adult needs nearly $120,000 annually to live comfortably. Historical data shows that during economic crises, nonprofits play a critical role in community support, and without sustained federal investment, the gap between community needs and available resources will widen. The organizations encourage community members to advocate for funding and support local initiatives through donations and volunteering, stressing the importance of a strong safety net for the most vulnerable populations.
