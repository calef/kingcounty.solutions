King County's 2024 highlights include significant advancements in various community services and infrastructure. The county constructed 1,248 affordable homes and established 1,350 emergency housing units, aiding those experiencing homelessness. Efforts to combat the opioid crisis were bolstered by a 24/7 hotline and mobile treatment programs, enabling over 500 individuals to access medication for opioid use disorders. Behavioral health crisis care improved with the expansion of mobile teams and the opening of a 24/7 crisis center in Kirkland.

Public transportation saw enhancements with over 3,700 new Metro bus trips and the introduction of the RapidRide G Line. A public safety operation, Operation Safe Transit, led to the seizure of 487 pounds of drugs and over 330 arrests. The county also upgraded its emergency radio system for first responders and built a battery system for the West Point Treatment Plant to ensure reliable power.

Environmental initiatives included the largest floodplain restoration project, benefiting salmon habitats. The county passed a plan supporting over 700 arts and heritage organizations and launched a heat pump program for low-income households. Additionally, King County Regional Animal Services facilitated the adoption of 3,440 animals and returned 744 lost pets.
