  partners are expanding access to effective, low-barrier treatment. This year we
  created a 24/7 hotline that provides medication for opioid use disorder, launched
  mobile treatment programs to reach people where they are and distributed life-saving

  all these hoops,” said Dr. Lauren Whiteside, a UW emergency physician who helped
  conceive the hotline and is one of 15 providers who answer the phone. “This program
  harnesses that exact moment [when someone is ready to start treatment] with a lot
  of support … so starting treatment doesn’t feel like this insurmountable task.”</p><iframe

  Added more Metro bus service and launched the RapidRide G Line</strong></h4><p>Metro
  added over 3,700 new bus trips each week, connected buses to new light rail stations
  and launched the RapidRide G Line with service through downtown Seattle, First Hill,
  Capitol Hill, the Central District and Madison Valley.</p><p>Metro operators helped
  ensure two Link light rail expansions could open this year, the new 1 Line to Lynnwood
  and the 2 Line on the Eastside — a first for both Sound Transit and King County.</p><p>We
  hired more staff for Metro Transit Police, more than doubled the number of transit
  security officers and moved cleaning crews to 24/7 service.</p><p>Metro also kicked
  off construction on its first all-electric bus base.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ipTsJ5dGDMte0Wfqsnx_zg.jpeg"

  operation</strong></h4><p>The King County Sheriff’s Office Precinct 4 Special Emphasis
  Team seized 487 pounds of narcotics this year — an estimated street value of $13.5
  million. That includes more than 536,000 M-30 fentanyl pills, 169 pounds of meth
  and 163 pounds of fentanyl powder.</p><p>King County also launched Operation Safe
  Transit, a <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/law-justice/sheriffs-office-joins-effort-to-reign-in-drug-crimes-on-seattles-third-avenue/">public
  safety operation</a> to make transit safer, combat crime and provide behavioral
  health resources, particularly in downtown Seattle. The initiative includes undercover
  operations and patrols along the Third Avenue transit corridor and has resulted
  in over 330 arrests regionwide so far.</p><h4><strong>6. Updated and expanded the
  emergency radio system for first responders and dispatch communications</strong></h4><p>The
  Puget Sound Emergency Radio Network is a state-of-the-art, digital system that allows
  police, fire, EMS and 911 dispatchers to communicate better and respond quickly
  to emergencies countywide. This new network greatly improves first responders’ ability
  to dispatch critical services when and where they’re needed.</p><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F5hqGbMoIEuo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D5hqGbMoIEuo&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F5hqGbMoIEuo%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"

King County's 2024 highlights include significant advancements in various community services and infrastructure. The county constructed 1,248 affordable homes and established 1,350 emergency housing units, aiding those experiencing homelessness. Efforts to combat the opioid crisis were bolstered by a 24/7 hotline and mobile treatment programs, enabling over 500 individuals to access medication for opioid use disorders. Behavioral health crisis care improved with the expansion of mobile teams and the opening of a 24/7 crisis center in Kirkland.

Public transportation saw enhancements with over 3,700 new Metro bus trips and the introduction of the RapidRide G Line. A public safety operation, Operation Safe Transit, led to the seizure of 487 pounds of drugs and over 330 arrests. The county also upgraded its emergency radio system for first responders and built a battery system for the West Point Treatment Plant to ensure reliable power.

Environmental initiatives included the largest floodplain restoration project, benefiting salmon habitats. The county passed a plan supporting over 700 arts and heritage organizations and launched a heat pump program for low-income households. Additionally, King County Regional Animal Services facilitated the adoption of 3,440 animals and returned 744 lost pets.
