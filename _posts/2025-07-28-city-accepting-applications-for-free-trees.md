The City of Bellevue is offering free trees to residents and community organizations as part of its fifth annual Tree Giveaway. This initiative, in partnership with 300 Trees and Amazon, will distribute 700 trees, with a selection of nine species including coast redwood, bigleaf maple, and southern magnolia. The application period runs until August 26 or until all trees are claimed. After applying, participants will receive a tree ordering date to choose their preferred species based on availability. The distribution event will take place on October 25 from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. at Bannerwood Sports Park, where attendees will also receive free watering bags and mulch, along with planting instructions. This program has provided over 3,200 trees since its launch, allowing up to two trees per resident and 20 per community organization each year. Bellevue aims to enhance its tree canopy, which plays a crucial role in absorbing greenhouse gases, improving air quality, providing shade, and managing stormwater runoff. The city reached a 40% tree canopy coverage goal in 2021 and continues to prioritize tree placement in areas that will maximize environmental benefits.
