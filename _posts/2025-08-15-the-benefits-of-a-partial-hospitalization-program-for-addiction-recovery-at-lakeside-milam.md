  to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), in 2024,
  more than 52 million people needed substance use treatment but <a href=\"https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/reports/rpt56287/2024-nsduh-annual-national-report.pdf\">only
  about 10 million people got the help they needed</a>. Many people who did not sustain
  lasting recovery reported that they didn’t think they had enough time to participate
  in substance abuse treatment. This may be due to a misperception of the range of
  addiction care programs that are available; when you say “rehab” people often hear
  “24/7 residential inpatient program.” And while inpatient care is the right choice
  for some, there are other options. A partial hospitalization program or PHP program
  offers extended time to develop skills and recovery support for additional weeks
  or months. Despite its name, a partial hospitalization program doesn’t mean you’ll
  be hospitalized. Instead, it’s a type of intense drug addiction treatment and relapse
  prevention program that includes daytime programming with or without housing. During
  PHP, participants gain tools to help build a sober future and establish a solid
  recovery plan.</p>\n<h2>The Continuum of Addiction Care</h2>\n<p>First, let’s look
  at the continuum of addiction care. There are different levels of substance abuse
  care, each one designed to address the needs of people in different stages of active
  addiction.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Detox</li>\n<li>Inpatient/Residential</li>\n<li>Partial
  hospitalization program</li>\n<li>Intensive outpatient treatment / <a href=\"https://lakesidemilam.com/online-virtual-addiction-treatment/\">online
  virtual treatment</a></li>\n<li>Aftercare</li>\n<li>Alumni programs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The
  level at which you enter the continuum of addiction care depends on several factors,
  including what stage of addiction you’re facing, any co-occurring disorders or diagnoses,
  your general health, your financial situation, and other circumstances unique to
  you. When choosing a treatment program, it’s important to find a facility that offers
  the entire continuum of care in case you need to step up or down your level of care.</p>\n<h2>Inpatient
  vs. Outpatient Programs</h2>\n<p>Most people begin treatment through either an inpatient
  program or some type of outpatient program. Offering 24/7 care, support, and supervision,
  inpatient programs are good fit for people who:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Need medically supervised
  detox</li>\n<li>Are in a severe stage of addiction</li>\n<li>Have co-occurring disorders</li>\n<li>Don’t
  have a supportive home environment</li>\n<li>Who have previously participated in
  treatment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Outpatient programs are more flexible, enabling participants
  to live at home while attending several hours of therapy and treatment per day.
  Outpatient addiction treatment is a good option for people who:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are
  in a mild to moderate stage of addiction</li>\n<li>Have a stable, supportive home
  environment</li>\n<li>Are committed to their recovery</li>\n<li>Need to continue
  working and meeting family obligations</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are three basic levels
  of outpatient care:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Primary hospitalization programs (PHP) consisting
  of 4.5 hours of treatment per day, five days per week</li>\n<li>Intensive outpatient
  programs (IOP) consisting of 3 hours of treatment per day, three days per week</li>\n<li>Early
  recovery services, typically consisting of peer support groups, periodic individual
  therapy sessions, case management, and drug testing, if</li>\n</ul>\n<p>PHPs are
  the most time intensive type of outpatient care, followed by IOPs. Early recovery
  services are usually part of your continuing care plan after you complete a more
  structured outpatient program.</p>\n<h2>What Level of Care Do You Need?</h2>\n<p>With
  so many program choices, it can be difficult to figure out what level of care you
  need. The first step in choosing a program is having an <a href=\"https://lakesidemilam.com/assessment-for-substance-abuse/\">assessment
  by a clinical professional.</a> Just like physical illnesses, substance use disorder
  is a treatable disease that can be diagnosed by a professional. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK64828/\">According
  to the National Institutes of Health</a>, an assessment should take the following
  factors into account:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What substances you’re using</li>\n<li>How
  long and how much you’ve been using</li>\n<li>The potential for drug withdrawal
  symptoms</li>\n<li>The level of supervision you need</li>\n<li>Your readiness for
  or resistance to treatment</li>\n<li>Any co-occurring physical or mental health
  conditions</li>\n<li>The risk of relapse</li>\n<li>Your home environment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At
  Lakeside-Milam, we take the information we learn in a clinical assessment to recommend
  the level of treatment that will be best for you and personalize your treatment
  program. You can meet with our staff and receive this evaluation at no charge.</p>\n<h2>Is
  a Partial Hospitalization Program Right for You?</h2>\n<p>When it comes to substance
  abuse treatment, a partial hospitalization program provides the best of both worlds.
  A PHP program offers intense levels of treatment similar to what you’ll experience
  in a residential program and the flexibility of being able to live at home. PHP
  programs are usually a good choice for people who need a lot of support and structure
  as they begin their recovery journey as well as for people who have completed an
  inpatient program and are ready to ease back into everyday life while still receiving
  a high level of addiction care.</p>\n<h2>What to Expect from a Partial Hospitalization
  Program</h2>\n<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) have identified <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2848466/\">five
  main goals</a> of a PHP program:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Providing a step-down from inpatient
  care</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2848466/\">Crisis
  stabilization</a></li>\n<li>Providing support and structure for behavioral activation</li>\n<li>Creating
  an empowerment-based environment for change</li>\n<li>Planning for future recovery
  and relapse prevention</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A partial hospitalization program offers
  a wide variety of evidence-based therapies that help you discover, face, and address
  the issues that are contributing to your substance use disorder. You’ll also learn
  and strengthen coping skills to manage cravings and prevent relapse. Lakeside-Milam’s
  PHP program includes therapies such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Individual counselling</li>\n<li>Group
  therapy sessions</li>\n<li>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)</li>\n<li>Dialectical
  behavioral therapy (DBT)</li>\n<li>Rational emotive therapy (RET)</li>\n<li>Education</li>\n<li>Holistic
  therapies such as art, yoga, and meditation</li>\n<li>Nutritional therapy</li>\n<li>Relapse
  prevention</li>\n<li>Community support groups</li>\n<li>Process groups</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At
  Lakeside-Milam, your treatment program will be tailored to your specific needs and
  goals. You’ll attend treatment four and a half hours per day, five days per week.
  Our PHP program strikes a balance between the intense level of treatment needed
  for successful long-term recovery and the need to continue working part time, attending
  classes, being part of your family, and meeting daily obligations.</p>\n<h2>How
  Long Is a PHP Program?</h2>\n<p>PHPs usually consist of several hours of treatment
  per day, five days per week. At Lakeside-Milam, you’ll attend therapy four and a
  half hours per day, five days per week. The total length of your program will depend
  on your specific circumstances, including whether you’ve already completed inpatient
  treatment or if you’re just beginning your recovery journey. That being said, most
  people participate in a PHP program between several weeks to a few months.</p>\n<h2>Who
  Staffs a PHP program?</h2>\n<p>In a PHP program, you’ll have access to a wide variety
  of specialized professionals and caregivers. At Lakeside-Milam, our PHP staff includes
  substance use disorder professionals, mental health therapists, counselors, medical
  professionals, and nutritionists.</p>\n<h2>Is a PHP Effective for Addiction Recovery
  Care?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3811995/\">Research</a>
  has shown PHP programs can be <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22161384/\">as
  effective as residential programs</a> and have <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16507966/\">higher
  patient satisfaction rates</a> than inpatient programs. PHP programs offer an important
  middle ground on the continuum of addiction care, giving patients access to the
  same evidence-based therapies as an inpatient program without the time commitment
  required by inpatient substance abuse treatment. More than 80% of Lakeside-Milam’s
  clients receive care through an outpatient program and many of our referrals come
  from past clients. With more than 10,000 alumni, we see these referrals as evidence
  that our programs truly help people struggling with addiction.</p>\n<h2>How to Find
  a Quality Partial Hospitalization Program</h2>\n<p>When looking for a partial hospitalization

  ## The Continuum of Addiction Care

  First, let’s look at the continuum of addiction care. There are different levels of substance abuse care, each one designed to address the needs of people in different stages of active addiction.

  - Detox
  - Inpatient/Residential
  - Partial hospitalization program
  - Intensive outpatient treatment / [online virtual treatment](https://lakesidemilam.com/online-virtual-addiction-treatment/)
  - Aftercare
  - Alumni programs

  The level at which you enter the continuum of addiction care depends on several factors, including what stage of addiction you’re facing, any co-occurring disorders or diagnoses, your general health, your financial situation, and other circumstances unique to you. When choosing a treatment program, it’s important to find a facility that offers the entire continuum of care in case you need to step up or down your level of care.

  ## Inpatient vs. Outpatient Programs

  Most people begin treatment through either an inpatient program or some type of outpatient program. Offering 24/7 care, support, and supervision, inpatient programs are good fit for people who:

  - Need medically supervised detox
  - Are in a severe stage of addiction
  - Have co-occurring disorders
  - Don’t have a supportive home environment
  - Who have previously participated in treatment

  Outpatient programs are more flexible, enabling participants to live at home while attending several hours of therapy and treatment per day. Outpatient addiction treatment is a good option for people who:

  - Are in a mild to moderate stage of addiction
  - Have a stable, supportive home environment
  - Are committed to their recovery
  - Need to continue working and meeting family obligations

  There are three basic levels of outpatient care:

  - Primary hospitalization programs (PHP) consisting of 4.5 hours of treatment per day, five days per week
  - Intensive outpatient programs (IOP) consisting of 3 hours of treatment per day, three days per week
  - Early recovery services, typically consisting of peer support groups, periodic individual therapy sessions,&nbsp;case management, and drug testing, if

  PHPs are the most time intensive type of outpatient care, followed by IOPs. Early recovery services are usually part of your continuing care plan after you complete a more structured outpatient program.

  Lakeside-Milam
topics:
- Mental Health & Counseling
---

Partial hospitalization programs (PHP) at Lakeside Milam offer a structured treatment option for individuals recovering from addiction. These programs provide intensive care while allowing patients to return home in the evenings, balancing support and independence. PHP is beneficial for those who require more than traditional outpatient services but do not need the full-time care of inpatient treatment.

Patients engage in various therapeutic activities, including individual and group therapy, which foster a supportive community and promote recovery skills. The program also addresses co-occurring mental health disorders, ensuring comprehensive treatment. By participating in PHP, individuals can maintain their daily responsibilities while actively working on their recovery.

The flexibility of partial hospitalization allows patients to integrate their treatment into their lives, making it easier to apply learned skills in real-world situations. It serves as a vital step for many on their path to sobriety, helping to reduce the risk of relapse. PHP at Lakeside Milam emphasizes personalized care, enabling participants to tailor their treatment experience according to their specific needs and goals, ultimately enhancing their chances for long-term recovery success.
