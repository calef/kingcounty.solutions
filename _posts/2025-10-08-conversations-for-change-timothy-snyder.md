United Way of King County is hosting an event in its Conversations for Change series featuring historian Timothy Snyder on October 26 at Benaroya Hall. Snyder, a prominent expert on World War history, Communism, and the Holocaust, is currently a professor at the University of Toronto. He has authored several influential books, including "On Tyranny" and "On Freedom," which explore themes of freedom and authoritarianism. Snyder plans to focus his discussion on "On Freedom," addressing its misconceptions and its significance for survival. He emphasizes the importance of recognizing when to resist authority, highlighted by his lesson "Do Not Obey in Advance," which suggests individuals should maintain their own sense of what is normal and not passively accept unjust situations. Snyder's work has also inspired a variety of cultural expressions, including art and music. United Way aims to ensure accessibility for all attendees, offering accommodations upon request. Tickets are available with a discount code for attendees.
