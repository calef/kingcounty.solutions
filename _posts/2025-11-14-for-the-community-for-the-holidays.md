Glover Empower Mentoring is preparing for its 15th Annual Thanksgiving Celebration, which will provide free food and gifts to the community, particularly amidst economic challenges resulting from a recent government shutdown. CEO Kendrick Glover emphasized the importance of this event as it aims to meet the needs of families struggling with food insecurity. The celebration will take place at the Xtadium Lounge in Seattle and is expected to attract around 300 families, offering a Thanksgiving meal along with items like turkeys, coats, and gift cards. Glover Empower Mentoring not only serves youth and young adults but also extends support to their communities. The organization is part of the United Way of King County’s Black Community Building Collective, collaborating with local nonprofits like the Technology Access Foundation, which also provides Thanksgiving meals to families. Glover highlighted the significance of these initiatives, especially during times of food shortages, stating that they help alleviate burdens for families who may find it difficult to ask for assistance. These community-driven events aim to fill the gaps during vulnerable times and are seen as a privilege to support those in need.
