On October 8th, a Medicare/Medicaid expert will be available at the center to answer questions. Participants are encouraged to submit specific queries in advance. A new Lake City Seniors WhatsApp group is being launched for important updates, including cancellations or inclement weather. Classes on how to use WhatsApp will be offered by John later this month.

October programming includes weekly Roundtable Conversations every Monday at 1:00 PM, where social worker Syl will lead discussions on various topics aimed at fostering reflection and friendship. Topics include survival items for a desert island, neighborhood changes over time, generational understanding, and historical dinner guests.
