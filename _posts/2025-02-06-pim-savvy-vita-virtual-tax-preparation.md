PIM Savvy VITA has introduced Virtual Tax Preparation services in collaboration with the IRS to assist individuals who cannot attend in-person appointments. This service aims to reach more people, particularly in rural communities, ensuring access to high-quality tax preparation. All VITA volunteers are IRS-certified, providing secure and accurate tax return preparation.

The process begins with a virtual video meeting where clients present their ID and tax documents. After explaining the procedure and DocuSign usage, clients upload their documents via a secure platform. A second meeting follows for the Intake and Interview, where identity verification occurs again, and necessary clarifications are made. 

Once the tax return is prepared, a third video meeting is conducted for the Quality Review Process, allowing clients to review their return and ask questions. Clients will sign Form 8879 through DocuSign, authorizing electronic submission of their tax return to the IRS. If any issues arise, clients will be contacted for resolution before resubmission. Virtual Tax Appointments started on January 31, 2025, and appointments are required for this free service.
