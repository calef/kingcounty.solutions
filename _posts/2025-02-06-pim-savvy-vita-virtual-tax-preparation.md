  <p>PIM Savvy VITA now offers Virtual Tax Preparation services in partnership with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). We understand many people simply don’t have the time or are unable to schedule an in-person appointment at a tax prep assistance office which is why we chose to add Virtual Tax Preparation services. With this added service, we can serve and reach even more people with their tax preparation needs, especially those in resilient and rural communities.</p>



  <p>Virtual Tax Preparation services allow taxpayers to receive the same high-quality service as in-person tax preparation. All our Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) volunteers are IRS-certified and taxpayers who use our Virtual Tax Preparation service can trust that their tax return will be prepared accurately and securely.</p>



  <p>Virtual tax prep is safe, convenient and easy to do.</p>



  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong><br>Attend a virtual video meeting to show your ID and Social Security Card or ITIN paperwork to the IRS-certified VITA volunteer on camera. During this video call we will explain the virtual process and explain how DocuSign works. We will provide the virtual consent form and the Intake form (fillable PDF) through DocuSign either during or after this meeting.</p>



  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong><br>With a secure internet service (not a public Wi-Fi), upload copies of your tax documents, a copy of your government issued picture ID, and Social Security Card or ITIN paperwork through a secure tax platform (TaxSlayer) and an IRS-certified VITA volunteer will review your documents.</p>



  <p><strong>Step 3:</strong><br>After your uploaded documents and Intake form have been reviewed, you will meet with a VITA tax preparer through a second virtual video meeting for the Intake and Interview process. During this meeting, your identity will be verified again, and the VITA volunteer will confirm the information you provided on the Intake form (plus uploaded copies of your tax documents, ID and Social Security Cards or ITIN paperwork). The VITA volunteer will ask clarifying questions if needed.</p>



  <p><strong>Step 4:</strong><br>Your tax return will be prepared by a VITA tax preparer, and you will be contacted by phone if any questions arise.</p>



  <p><strong>Step 5:</strong><br>After your tax return has been prepared virtually, you will have a third virtual video meeting with another VITA tax preparer for the Quality Review Process. During this process, your identity will be verified again, and the VITA tax preparer will review your tax return with you and answer any questions you may have.</p>



  <p><strong>Step 6:</strong><br>You will sign <strong>Form 8879, IRS e-file Signature Authorization</strong> through DocuSign. Form 8879 includes the Taxpayer Declaration and Signature Authorization.</p>



  <ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>Taxpayer Declaration and Signature Authorization: I declare that I have examined a copy of the income tax return (original or amended) I am now authorizing, and to the best of my knowledge and belief, it is true, correct, and complete.</li>
  </ul>



  <p><strong>Step 7:</strong><br>After you sign Form 8879, the VITA tax preparer will electronically submit your tax return to the IRS. If the IRS rejects your tax return for any reason, you will be contacted by phone, and the reason will be explained. If this issue can be rectified, your tax return will be updated, and another Quality Review will take place. After the second Quality Review is complete, you will proceed with the next steps.</p>



  <p><strong>*Note:</strong> Throughout the Virtual Tax Preparation process, you may have meetings with different VITA volunteers. Standard VITA procedure requires the preparation and review of your tax return to be conducted by different VITA tax preparers.</p>

PIM Savvy VITA has introduced virtual tax preparation services in collaboration with the IRS to assist individuals who cannot attend in-person appointments. This service aims to reach more people, particularly in rural communities, ensuring access to high-quality tax preparation. All VITA volunteers are IRS-certified, providing secure and accurate tax return preparation.

The process begins with a virtual video meeting where clients present their ID and tax documents. After explaining the procedure and DocuSign usage, clients upload their documents via a secure platform. A second meeting follows for the intake and interview, where identity verification occurs again and necessary clarifications are made.

Once the tax return is prepared, a third video meeting is conducted for the quality review process, allowing clients to review their return and ask questions. Clients will sign Form 8879 through DocuSign, authorizing electronic submission of their tax return to the IRS. If any issues arise, clients will be contacted for resolution before resubmission. Virtual tax appointments started on Jan. 31, 2025, and appointments are required for this free service.
