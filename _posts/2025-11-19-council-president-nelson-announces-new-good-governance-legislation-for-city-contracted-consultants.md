Council President Sara Nelson has proposed new ethics legislation for city-contracted consultants in Seattle, aiming to enhance transparency and mitigate conflicts of interest. This bill revises the ethics code to include reporting and disclosure mandates for political consultants, similar to those for lobbyists. It prohibits consultants from simultaneously working on city projects and election campaigns, and it imposes a one-year "cooling off" period before a consultant can provide political campaign services after their city consulting contract ends. Nelson emphasized that these measures are intended to rebuild public trust in local government and establish clearer rules to limit the influence of consultants' political or financial interests on decision-making. The proposed legislation will be introduced Thursday and discussed in the Governance, Accountability and Economic Development Committee on Dec. 4.
