Peperoni Alla Salernitana, or Braised Peppers with Potato and Basil, is a flavorful dish that serves four. The recipe requires four red bell peppers, four large Yukon Gold potatoes (peeled and diced), olive oil, garlic, red wine vinegar, basil leaves, and kosher salt. 

To prepare, roast two of the peppers over an open flame until blackened, then cover them to steam and cool before peeling, seeding, and dicing. The other two raw peppers are diced similarly. Boil the diced potatoes in salted water for about 10 minutes until tender, then drain and cool them.

In a heavy-bottomed pan, heat olive oil over medium heat and sauté the raw peppers until fragrant. Next, add the smashed garlic, roasted peppers, and vinegar, reducing the heat to medium-low to simmer for 25 minutes. Finally, incorporate the cooked potatoes and fresh basil, seasoning with salt to taste, and continue cooking until the potatoes are warmed through. This dish showcases the vibrant flavors of peppers and basil, making it a delightful addition to any meal.
