A federal judge has sentenced Markel Strong, a 29-year-old man from Memphis, Tennessee, to 221 months in prison for illegally possessing a firearm as a felon, under the Armed Career Criminal Act. Strong's sentence includes three years of supervised release and reflects the Justice Department's ongoing commitment to addressing gun violence and prosecuting repeat offenders. Strong was found guilty after a jury determined that his three prior violent felony convictions warranted enhanced penalties. His arrest occurred on January 19, 2022, when Memphis Police stopped his vehicle for a traffic violation and discovered a firearm in plain view. Despite being prohibited from possessing firearms due to his felony history, he continued to carry a weapon. The case was investigated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and the Memphis Police Department (MPD), showcasing a collaborative effort to combat violent crime. The U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Tennessee emphasized the danger posed by convicted felons with firearms and the significant consequences for such behavior, marking this case as a removal of a violent armed career criminal from the streets.
