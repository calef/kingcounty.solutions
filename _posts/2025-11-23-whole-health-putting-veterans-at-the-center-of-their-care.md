The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is implementing a "Whole Health" approach to care, placing veterans at the center of their healthcare experience. This initiative emphasizes personalized, proactive, and patient-driven care, aiming to improve overall well-being and health outcomes for veterans. Whole Health focuses on what matters most to veterans, encouraging them to engage in their health decisions and lifestyle choices. 

The approach incorporates various elements, including mental, physical, and spiritual health, recognizing that veterans have unique needs and experiences. The VA offers resources such as health coaching, mindfulness training, and complementary therapies to support this model. By fostering a supportive environment, the VA aims to empower veterans to take charge of their health and achieve their personal health goals. 

Veterans are encouraged to participate in creating their health plans, which can lead to improved satisfaction and better health results. This shift reflects a broader trend in healthcare towards holistic practices that prioritize individual preferences and needs, ultimately enhancing the quality of care provided to veterans throughout the VA system.
