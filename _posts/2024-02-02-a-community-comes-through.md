  now, north and east King County are the most expensive regions in Washington, according
  to the [Self-Sufficiency Standard](https://selfsufficiencystandard.org/Washington/)
  by UW’s Center for Women’s Welfare. As household costs continue to soar, it’s become
  increasingly difficult for thousands of our neighbors to make ends meet. The winter
  season can be especially tough for folks. During what should be a time of warmth
  and togetherness for all, many struggle to meet their essential needs while also
  preserving their cherished traditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nEach year, Hopelink’s Lend
  a Hoping Hand campaign works to bridge this gap, ensuring families have access to
  warmth, safe shelter, food that’s both nutritious and culturally relevant, as well
  as other programs to support them in developing stability. This year’s campaign
  raised over **$1.47 million** in donations and over **49,000 pounds of food** thanks
  to an enthusiastic community who heeded the call – with every cent and pound directly
  benefiting Hopelink services.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n![Lend a Hoping Hand](https://www.hopelink.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/LAHH.99-Recap-Blog-Graphic_V4-03.png

  Hand campaign raised over $1.47 million and saw a record-breaking number of fund
  and food drive participants._\n\n## **Impact in Action**\n\nBeyond the numbers are
  countless stories of real-life impact from our neighbors, like this one shared by
  an anonymous client of our Family Development program who was able to find safe
  shelter:&nbsp;\n\n“My case manager would give me daily updates so I wouldn’t lose
  hope. She understood the importance of just pure and simple hope. Even when there
  weren’t any updates, she would still update me to just let me know I hadn’t been
  forgotten. She coordinated with my new apartment complex, and I officially have
  my own apartment. They covered all the move-in fees and a good portion of my rent,
  so I can get to a point of true independence.”&nbsp;\n\n<script defer>\n\t\t(()

  = '_blank';\n\t\t\t\t\telm.title = 'Opens in a new tab';\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t});\n\t\t})();\n\t</script>\n\nAnother
  neighbor was able to keep warm with support from Hopelink’s Energy Assistance program:&nbsp;\n\n“Because
  of Hopelink, my water wasn’t turned off and I’m staying warm this winter. Sometimes
  people need a little help to get caught up after falling behind for any number of
  unforeseeable circumstances. For now, I no longer wake up every morning with the
  dread of my lights or water getting shut off.”\n\n<script defer>\n\t\t(() => {\n\t\t\tlet
  article = document.querySelector('.block8096135550467472');\n\n\t\t\tarticle.querySelectorAll('a').forEach(elm

  **Stocking the Shelve** s\n\nThe Food Assistance program also shared the unique
  impact the campaign had on Hopelink Food Markets. Amanda Lopez-Castanon, Director
  of Food programs said, “Many of our donors asked what items would be best to donate
  and we mentioned baking items. We definitely saw a large amount of flour, oil, spices,
  and sugar come in during this time. Many clients showed their excitement and enthusiasm
  about baking for their families during the holidays.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nSeveral of
  these items were provided by the **over 125 food and fund drives** our community
  started this year – **a record-breaking number of participants**! We were amazed
  by how intentionally people engaged with their drives this year, like the Bothell
  Family Co-Operative Pre-School who stopped by our Kirkland warehouse to drop off
  a whopping 504 pounds of food and 80 pounds of diapers. Raquel from the Co-Operative
  Pre-School shared, “It was a wonderful experience for us and the kids! We look forward
  to continuing the work with Hopelink.”&nbsp;\n\nMeanwhile, the staff at Growing
  Tree and Treehouse daycares collected close to 500 new and gently used books and
  delivered them to our Kirkland Food Market for families and children to enjoy! With
  the pressure of providing holiday gifts, thoughtful donations like this make a significant
  difference for many families.&nbsp;\n\n![LAHH Mobile Market Portrait 3](https://www.hopelink.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/LAHH_Mobile_Market_Portrait-3.jpg

  loved ones is a cherished tradition in countless households this time of year, but
  these popular baking ingredients may be unaffordable for many of our neighbors.
  Thanks to all who donated these items, families were not only able to obtain grocery
  staples at our Markets, but also had access to holiday favorites like pie crusts,
  pumpkin, cookie kits, and more to celebrate the season.\n\n## **It Takes a Village**\n\nAs
  the Markets brimmed with the hustle and bustle of families preparing for the holidays,
  our community showed up in full force, volunteering to support the increased demand
  and spread a little holiday cheer while at it.\n\n![LAHH Paul Gauvin Portrait](https://www.hopelink.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/LAHH_Paul_Gauvin_Portrait.jpg

  volunteering at Hopelink for more than a year and have been able to experience two
  end-of-year holiday seasons. I especially appreciate the November to December holiday
  time. Shoppers are more excited than usual to visit the Food Market. At the Sno-Valley
  Market, the beautifully decorated holiday tree and peppermint candy canes at the
  check-in station help make the Market more inviting. I enjoy providing food and
  friendship to shoppers all year long, but the year-end holiday season is especially
  gratifying.”\n\n<script defer>\n\t\t(() => {\n\t\t\tlet article = document.querySelector('.block5206660108161060');\n\n\t\t\tarticle.querySelectorAll('a').forEach(elm

  of the Markets, over 4,000 gift cards were issued to active clients with children.
  An expensive time of the year for everyone, unrestricted funds donated this time
  of year support our goal of providing as many gift cards as possible for our neighbors
  so they can purchase holiday gifts or other needs and not have to forgo other necessities.\n\nBoth
  the Energy Assistance and Financial Assistance program teams stayed busy throughout
  the season, working with our neighbors to offset utility costs and bridge the gap
  during financial emergencies.  \n  \n“We’ve seen a 55% increase in emergency financial
  assistance requests over the past 12 months,” said Cindy Donahue, Financial Resiliency
  Program Senior Manager. “The COVID-era ‘bridge’ proclamation ended in October 2021,
  which resulted in huge numbers of clients with pay or vacate notices and significant
  rent increases. Two years later, we continue to see this escalation.”  \n  \nWith
  rising costs of living in the region and other contributing systemic factors, many
  of our neighbors may live on fixed incomes or paycheck to paycheck. This means that
  one small crisis can quickly snowball and threaten a family’s stability, Cindy explained.
  \ \n  \n“The funds our program receives from donors 100% helps bridge these gaps
  so we can support more families and individuals,” she continued. “The funding we
  receive from donors allows us to provide a bridge of support so they can attain
  and maintain housing stability.”\n\n## **The Work Continues**\n\nSince its inception
  over ten years ago, the aim of the Lend a Hoping Hand campaign has been to ensure
  families don’t go without food, warmth, or shelter during the most challenging times
  of the year. &nbsp;\n\n“Through the campaign, we learned that the needs of our client
  community not only changed – but also grew,” said Josalyn Ford, Hopelink Vice President
  of Development. “This shift created an opportunity for us to lean into learning
  from our client community on how to better position our messaging to speak on their
  behalf – and in doing so – raise both awareness and funds to meet their needs more
  directly. Regardless of how our families celebrate the holiday season, it’s with
  the community by their side that they don’t have to worry about choosing between
  honoring their traditions and keeping food on their table or their houses warm during
  the winter months.”\n\nWe want to thank our community of donors, volunteers, schools,
  places of faith, first responders, and businesses for leaning in to meet these rising
  challenges alongside us. And, as the needs of our community are tremendous and on-going,
  we hope you continue to support this important work. [Learn about the many ways

Hopelink's annual Lend a Hoping Hand campaign raised over $1.47 million and 49,000 pounds of food in 2023, setting a record for fund and food drive participation. The campaign benefits families in north and east King County, Washington, some of the most expensive regions in the state, by providing food, warmth, and shelter, especially during winter. Donations directly benefited Hopelink services, such as the Family Development program, which helps clients find safe shelter, and the Energy Assistance program, which ensures clients stay warm during winter. The campaign also positively impacted Hopelink Food Markets, with a significant increase in donated baking items.
