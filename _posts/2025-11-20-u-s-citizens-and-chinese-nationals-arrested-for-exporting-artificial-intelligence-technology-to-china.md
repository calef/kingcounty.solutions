Two U.S. citizens and two Chinese nationals have been charged with conspiring to illegally export NVIDIA Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) with AI applications to China. The individuals involved are Hon Ning Ho, Brian Curtis Raymond, Cham Li, and Jing Chen, all residing in the U.S. Their arrests occurred on November 19, 2025. The indictment alleges that they engaged in deceptive practices, such as falsifying paperwork and creating fake contracts, to transship these controlled GPUs to China. The U.S. Department of Commerce had previously implemented new license requirements for exporting such technologies to China due to concerns over military and surveillance applications.

From September 2023 to November 2025, the group allegedly exported 400 NVIDIA A100 GPUs and attempted to export additional GPUs, which were intercepted by law enforcement. They reportedly received over $3.89 million from China to fund their operations. The defendants face serious charges, including conspiracy to violate export control laws, smuggling, and money laundering, with potential prison terms of up to 20 years per violation. The case is being prosecuted by federal attorneys and investigated by multiple law enforcement agencies.
