As Thanksgiving approaches, the importance of kindness and community is emphasized, highlighting its impact on the lives of older adults and their families. The message reflects on the gratitude for shared moments, both significant and small, and acknowledges the role of compassion in fostering connections. Transforming Age serves over 30,000 low-income adults through various programs, including Mercy Brown Bag, which provides groceries to over 10,000 seniors monthly, and Full Life Care, which supports over 5,000 individuals and delivers Thanksgiving meals to homebound seniors. The CIRC program helps ensure housing stability for more than 10,000 residents in affordable communities. The efforts of team members, volunteers, donors, and residents create a welcoming environment for all, fostering a sense of belonging. The message also pays tribute to veterans for their service and encourages gratitude, community support, and kindness as guiding principles. The president and CEO, Torsten, expresses deep appreciation for everyone involved and wishes a warm and meaningful Thanksgiving to all.
