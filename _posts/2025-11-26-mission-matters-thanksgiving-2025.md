  <p>Transforming Age Community,</p>

  Transforming Age Community,

  As we enter this season of gratitude, I’m reminded of Warren Buffett’s words: “Kindness is costless but also&nbsp;priceless.” In a world that can feel divided, your compassion and presence shine through every day,&nbsp;bringing our mission to life for thousands of older adults and their families.

  Thanksgiving prompts us to reflect on what matters most. I’m grateful for both the big and small moments&nbsp;we share—with loved ones and within our community. Each day, you give the gift of presence, showing up&nbsp;to serve, support, and build connections, even as you carry your own joys and challenges.

  Our community extends well beyond housing. Through programs like Mercy Brown Bag, Full Life Care, and&nbsp;CIRC, we provide not just community services, but dignity, hope, and belonging to more than 30,000 low-&nbsp;income adults. Mercy Brown Bag delivers critical groceries to over 10,000 seniors each month. Full Life&nbsp;Care offers vital support to over 5,000 people and continues its tradition of delivering Thanksgiving meals&nbsp;to homebound seniors. CIRC and its partners provide housing stability and a sense of community to more&nbsp;than 10,000 people in affordable housing communities.

  We also honor our veterans, whose service and sacrifice inspire us all.

  As we look ahead to the holidays, I want to express my deepest appreciation to every team member,&nbsp;volunteer, donor, and resident. Thank you for all you do, seen and unseen. May gratitude guide us,&nbsp;community hold us, and kindness lead the way.

  Wishing you and your loved ones a warm&nbsp;and meaningful Thanksgiving.

  My Best,
