Compass Housing Alliance has received a significant donation from longtime supporters Carol and Peter Stewart to initiate the Stewart Family Leadership Development Pathway. This program aims to enhance early-career training and development for Compass staff. The funds will be allocated to skills development relevant to human services, managerial and budgetary courses for career advancement, access to additional professional opportunities, and financial incentives to encourage growth within the organization. Christopher Ross, president of Compass Housing Alliance, emphasized the importance of hiring and retaining committed staff to fulfill their mission. Industry data indicates that human service organizations face an annual turnover rate of 27-33%, with replacement costs ranging from 50 to 150% of annual salaries. In a high-cost city like Seattle, where the job market is competitive, retaining staff is particularly challenging for nonprofits. Teena Ellison, senior director at Compass, noted that the funding will not only support rising leaders but also foster career longevity in social services, ultimately enhancing the care provided to the community.
