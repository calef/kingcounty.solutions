The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) recognizes the importance of hiring veterans and is celebrating National Hiring Veterans Month from Dec. 1 to Dec. 31, 2025. This initiative emphasizes the VA's commitment to providing job opportunities for veterans, helping them transition into civilian careers. Various events and activities will be organized throughout the month to promote awareness and connect veterans with potential employers.

Employers are encouraged to participate and consider hiring veterans, who bring valuable skills and experiences. Resources such as job fairs, networking opportunities, and training programs will be made available to assist veterans in their job search. The VA aims to highlight the unique qualifications that veterans possess and the benefits they can bring to the workforce.

In addition, the VA will showcase success stories of veterans who have successfully transitioned into the civilian workforce. This initiative aims to foster a supportive environment for veterans seeking employment and to enhance collaboration between employers and veteran communities. The VA is dedicated to ensuring that veterans receive the recognition and opportunities they deserve in the job market.
