As of July 1, 2025, Husky Health Clinic will be included in the UW Medicine financial assistance policy for professional services. This policy offers financial assistance to patients whose gross family income is up to 400% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL), adjusted for family size after third-party coverage has been exhausted. Patients with incomes between 0% and 300% of the FPL qualify for a 100% financial assistance discount for services at multiple facilities, including Harborview Medical Center and UW Medical Center. Those with incomes between 301% and 350% of the FPL can receive a 75% discount for facility services only, while those earning between 351% and 400% of the FPL are eligible for a 50% discount for facility services. To apply for financial assistance, individuals must complete an application and provide supporting information to verify household income. Applications can be submitted online via MyChart, which also allows users to track their application status, or through UW Medical Center or Harborview Medical Center by mail, fax, or in person.
