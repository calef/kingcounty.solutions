  Hopelink is proud to announce the appointment of Meghan Altimore as our Chief Executive Officer. The decision was made by Hopelink’s Board of Directors following a search led by a CEO Selection Committee. The Selection Committee included current and former Board members as well as a staff advisor.

  Meghan, was appointed Interim CEO in September after the passing of Hopelink CEO Geoff Crump.

  Meghan brings over 20 years of leadership experience with Hopelink, playing a critical role driving the agency’s growth while ensuring its services’ quality. She’s credited with establishing several of Hopelink’s services that north and east King County residents depend upon today, as well as leading the development of Hopelink’s Shoreline and Redmond Centers, standardizing data stewardship practices, and spearheading the integration of trauma-informed practices across the organization.

  “Meghan’s 20-year tenure with Hopelink shows a proven leader for profound changes, allowing Hopelink to grow and improve in powerful ways, developing operational and strategic expertise with her deep commitment for community service to help Hopelink and partners increase resources for people experiencing poverty,” said Byron Shutz, Chair of Hopelink’s Board of Directors. “While that impact is visible externally, those who have had the privilege to work alongside Meghan also recognize her thorough understanding of the ecosystem that Hopelink serves, the use of data to drive decisions while always keeping Hopelink values and mission at the forefront, and advocating for systemic changes and partnerships to support our organization and the community to help people exit poverty.”

  A social worker at heart, Meghan began her tenure with the agency in 2004 as Associate Director, Housing and Child Development. She served in progressive roles before she was appointed Vice President of Community Services in 2014 – overseeing all Hopelink’s service operations except the agency’s Transportation programs, in addition to its facilities team and Organizational Excellence department.

  She was appointed Interim Chief Operating Officer in the fall of 2023, upon which she began also leading Hopelink’s Transportation operations, before being confirmed as permanent COO in the spring of 2024.

  _“When I began my journey with Hopelink 20 years ago, with a toddler and a pre-schooler at home, I never could have imagined that I would have the opportunity to lead such a dynamic organization that is so deeply focused on serving the needs of our local communities,” Meghan shared. “I am grateful to learn and work beside an incredible team of staff, volunteers, and board members. I am even more grateful to the community members who trust Hopelink to help when they are struggling. It is a true honor to continue my career at Hopelink in this new capacity and to lead our organization through our next phases of growth and change. I am committed to listening deeply to everyone connected to Hopelink and applying that knowledge in every step we take together.”_

  One of Meghan’s first tasks as CEO will include appointing a COO, who will serve alongside Meghan on Hopelink’s nine-person leadership council. She will lead the completion of Hopelink’s 2023 – 2025 Strategic Plan, which maps the agency’s development in key areas such as: Resources; Programs; and Organizational Transformation.
