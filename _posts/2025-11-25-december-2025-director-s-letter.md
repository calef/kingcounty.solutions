  <p>Happy Holidays!</p>
  <p>The holiday season is my favorite time of the year and I hope that you have a happy holiday season knowing that your support as members, donors, volunteers, sponsors, etc. makes the work of the Sno-Valley Senior Center possible!</p>
  <p>As many of you know, Sno-Valley Senior Center has been affiliated with Sound Generations for 45 years, most of our time as an organization. After completing their strategic planning work over this past year, Sound Generations has made the decision that the three remaining senior centers partnered with them, Sno-Valley, Ballard, and Shoreline, will transition to full independence over the next 3 years.</p>
  <p>Sno-Valley Senior Center is well positioned for this next chapter, with our own 501c3, a building we own, and a healthy financial reserve. There will be no immediate changes to our programs or operations, and Sound Generations has committed to supporting a thoughtful, gradual transition. If you have questions, I am happy to answer them, and if you are interested in joining our transition committee, please let me know.</p>
  <p>Be looking for a Board Ballot to be mailed soon! A benefit of being a member of the Sno-Valley Senior Center is that you can vote on the new Board slate each year and vote on bylaws changes at the annual meeting. There are Board Bios included with the ballot for the 2 prospective members. I want to say THANK YOU to our current Board President, John Moore, who will be going off the Board at the end of the year. John stepped in to the role for his last year on the Board and has been a great advocate for the senior center throughout his entire 6 years of service.</p>
  <p>I hope you’ll join us for the Annual Member Meeting on Thursday, January 28 at 12:30pm. At this meeting you’ll get to discuss with Board Members your priorities and questions for the Sno-Valley Senior Center, learn about goals for 2026, and how we ended 2025.</p>
  <p>Right now, we are getting ready for the Annual Steak Dinner &amp; Pie Auction and I want to say a big thank you to Dawn Board, Denise Crutchfield, George Englund, and Tom Bandy for making this event a success. Of course, so much thanks also goes out to all of the volunteers, attendees, and bakers!</p>
  <p>We’ve kicked off our end-of-year giving campaign, celebrating 50 years of home, health, friendship, and peace of mind here in the Valley. As we enter the holiday season, I hope you’ll consider a gift to help us finish our 50th year strong.</p>
  <p><b>GivingTuesday is December 2</b>, and we’ve set a goal of raising <b>$3,000</b> to support the fun, active, and engaging programs that so many older adults rely on. A gift of <b>$50 for our 50th year</b> is a powerful way to make an impact; and every dollar stays right here in our community.</p>
  <p>You can give online at:<br />
  <a href="https://fundraise.givesmart.com/form/fKEdwQ?vid=nqvby">https://fundraise.givesmart.com/form/fKEdwQ?vid=nqvby</a> or return the donation envelope included in this newsletter. If December 2 slips by, don’t worry! Our end-of-year campaign continues through <b>December 31</b>. Thank you for helping us finish this milestone year strong.</p>

As a reminder the center will be closed for the holidays from December 24 to January 4. We look forward to seeing you in the new year on January 5!</p>

Happy Holidays! The Sno-Valley Senior Center celebrates the support from its members, donors, and volunteers that makes its work possible. With a 45-year affiliation with Sound Generations, the center is set to become fully independent in the next three years. It is well-prepared for this transition, holding its own 501(c)(3) status, ownership of its building, and a solid financial reserve. There will be no immediate changes to programs, and a gradual transition is planned.

Members will soon receive a board ballot, allowing them to vote on new board members and bylaw changes. The center expresses gratitude to outgoing Board President John Moore for his six years of service. An annual member meeting is scheduled for Jan. 28, where members can discuss priorities and the center's goals for 2026.

The center has launched its end-of-year giving campaign, aiming to raise $3,000 by GivingTuesday on Dec. 2. Donations will support vital programs for older adults. The center will be closed for the holidays from Dec. 24 to Jan. 4, reopening on Jan. 5. Thank you for your continued support in finishing this milestone year strong!
