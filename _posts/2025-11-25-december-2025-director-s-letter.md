Happy Holidays! The Sno-Valley Senior Center celebrates the support from its members, donors, and volunteers that makes its work possible. With a 45-year affiliation with Sound Generations, the center is set to become fully independent in the next three years. It is well-prepared for this transition, holding its own 501c3 status, ownership of its building, and a solid financial reserve. There will be no immediate changes to programs, and a gradual transition is planned.

Members will soon receive a Board Ballot, allowing them to vote on new Board members and bylaws changes. The center expresses gratitude to outgoing Board President John Moore for his six years of service. An Annual Member Meeting is scheduled for January 28, where members can discuss priorities and the center's goals for 2026.

The center has launched its end-of-year giving campaign, aiming to raise $3,000 by GivingTuesday on December 2. Donations will support vital programs for older adults. The center will be closed for holidays from December 24 to January 4, reopening on January 5. Thank you for your continued support in finishing this milestone year strong!
