  **Family Makes Core Memories at Holiday Meals for Military Event**

  As Army veteran David Gonzalez watched the joyful smiles on the faces of his wife and son, he felt nothing but gratitude toward Operation Homefront donors who made it possible.

  On April 5, the family attended the [Holiday Meals for Military® (HMFM)](https://operationhomefront.org/holiday-meals-for-military/) event in Delray, Florida. The event was hosted at the HERD Foundation, a nonprofit that supports equine therapy. Families enjoyed pony rides, crafts, and games.

Army veteran David Gonzalez and his family attended the Holiday Meals for Military® (HMFM) event in Delray, Florida, on April 5, where they enjoyed pony rides, crafts, and games. Each family received a $75 gift card and a box of household goods. David’s son, Xzavier, experienced his first horseback ride, and the event reminded Melanie, David’s wife, of her childhood in Nicaragua. David expressed gratitude towards Operation Homefront and the volunteers who made the day special, stating it was a memorable experience for his family.

David enlisted in the Army in 2012 and faced challenges post-service, including injuries from a rollover accident and struggles with PTSD. The family also dealt with Melanie's health issues during her pregnancy and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. After receiving 100 percent disability benefits, they began to find stability. David now works at the veterans center at Palm Beach State College while pursuing a bachelor’s degree. Melanie, feeling better, is also taking IT courses and is working towards getting her driver's license. The HMFM event was a joyful occasion, providing them with lasting memories and support. Since 2010, the HMFM program has served over 210,000 military families.
