The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida have initiated an investigation into United Parks & Resorts Inc., which owns SeaWorld Orlando, Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, and Aquatica Orlando. This investigation aims to determine potential violations of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) related to disability discrimination against guests. Complaints have been received from individuals with disabilities who assert that the parks prohibit the use of specific mobility aids, known as “rollator walkers.” These guests claim they cannot access the parks without their rollators, and the alternative mobility aids provided are unsuitable for their disabilities, often incurring additional costs. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon emphasized the importance of ADA protections against disability-based discrimination in public accommodations, while U.S. Attorney Gregory W. Kehoe reaffirmed the commitment to ensuring equal access for all individuals with disabilities. The case is being handled by Trial Attorney David K. Gardner and Assistant U.S. Attorney Alexandra N. Karahalios. Individuals who feel they have experienced discrimination are encouraged to file complaints with the Civil Rights Division.
