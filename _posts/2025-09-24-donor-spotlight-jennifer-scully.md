  <h2><strong>Donor Spotlight: Jennifer’s Story – Investing in Hope, Year After Year</strong></h2>
  <p>Fourteen years ago, Jennifer attended her first <span style="color: #ff6600;"><a style="color: #ff6600;" href="https://youtheastsideservices.org/investinyouth"><em>Invest in Youth Breakfast</em></a></span> at the invitation of her friend and YES board member, Jennifer Ivan. She had no idea then how much that one morning would shape her ongoing commitment to youth mental health in our community.</p>
  <blockquote><p>“I look forward to it every year,” Jennifer says. “I always leave with a full heart and learning more about the needs of youth in our community.”</p></blockquote>
  <p>What keeps her coming back isn’t just tradition, it’s transformation. The youth speakers, she says, are the heart of the event.</p>
  <blockquote><p>“Hearing how they have navigated through a challenge is so powerful and is such a message of hope.”</p></blockquote>
  <p>Some of Jennifer’s most cherished memories from the breakfast include moments of humor, connection, and awe, like when actor Sean Astin brought the room to life with lines from <em>The Hobbit</em> in his Samwise Gamgee voice. Or the year she brought her daughter to meet author Cheryl Strayed, who signed a book for them both. These moments of joy and reflection underscored the very real impact YES has on young lives.</p>
  <p>As a mother, Jennifer has seen firsthand how vital mental health support is.</p>
  <blockquote><p>“My kids were in high school and college during the pandemic, and I witnessed the struggles they and their friends faced,” she shares. “Kids today carry so much: social media pressures, academic expectations, and post-pandemic challenges. I just want to give them all a hug.”</p></blockquote>
  <p>It’s that deep empathy that fuels her steadfast support.</p>
  <blockquote><p>“You are literally investing in our community’s future,” she says to anyone considering a first-time gift. “Our kids deserve to feel supported and to have the tools to thrive into adulthood.”</p></blockquote>
  <p>Jennifer gives with confidence, knowing that her donations go directly toward programs that make a difference.</p>
  <blockquote><p>“I know that no dollar is ever wasted. Even small donations can keep key programs running. I get incredible value for my donations, and I know it pays our community back in dividends.”</p></blockquote>
  <p>Looking ahead, Jennifer hopes for a future where more youth and families feel empowered to seek help and know they are not alone.</p>
  <blockquote><p>“I hope they see how much their community truly cares about them.”</p></blockquote>
  <p>To Jennifer and donors like her: thank you. Your enduring generosity brings healing, resilience, and hope to the lives of so many young people. Because of you, they know they are not alone.</p>
