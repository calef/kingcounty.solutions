The City of Seattle has achieved 4th place in the 25th Annual Digital Cities Survey, conducted by the Center for Digital Government, marking its second consecutive year in the top four. This recognition highlights Seattle's innovative use of technology to address urban challenges such as public safety, budget issues, and homelessness. The award underscores the city's commitment to strategic priorities set by the Mayor and City Council, focusing on safety, housing, health, and economic opportunities.

Seattle's Chief Technology Officer, Rob Lloyd, emphasized the city's commitment to leveraging technology to enhance service delivery amidst resource constraints. The 2025–2027 IT Strategic Plan, developed with input from numerous stakeholders, aims to optimize city operations and strengthen partnerships. The Seattle Department of Transportation is noted for its advancements in utilizing transportation data for enhanced transparency and safety.

Earlier in the year, Seattle received two awards from the CDG for its accessible digital services and was also recognized with a Regional Emmy and a Digital Inclusion award. The Digital Cities Awards will be formally presented on November 19 in Salt Lake City, Utah, celebrating cities that creatively address social challenges through technology.
