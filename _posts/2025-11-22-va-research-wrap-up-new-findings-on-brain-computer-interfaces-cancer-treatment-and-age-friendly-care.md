  <p>Pittsburgh VA teamed with Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh researchers to develop a new brain-computer interface system that allows Veterans to more easily control robotic arms or computer cursors with their thoughts. </p>



  <p>The brain-computer interface is a cap of 64 electrodes that slides over the user’s head, which is connected to an electroencephalography (EEG) machine that records brain waves.

  <p>Ten volunteers, three with a recent history of stroke and seven with no stroke history, were all able to control both interface movement and clicking simultaneously to grab, move, and place objects using a robotic arm.

  <p>A San Antonio, Texas, VA researcher was part of a team that found suppressing the expression of a small protein can reduce cell growth in cancers such as non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

  <p>Using cultured human cells from biopsy and mouse models, the researchers identified a new compound that blocks the activity of RAB7 in a dose-dependent way.

  <p>The researchers compared a group of 2,400 older Veterans from six VA hospitals who received the 4Ms with a similar group of 4,700 who did not receive the assessment.

title: 'VA Research Wrap Up: New findings on brain-computer interfaces, cancer treatment
  and age-friendly care'
topics:
- Disabilities
- Health Care

VA researchers are advancing in three key areas: brain-computer interfaces, cancer diagnostics, and aging. The brain-computer interface projects aim to help veterans with severe disabilities regain control over their environments through direct brain communication with devices. This technology could significantly enhance the quality of life for individuals with paralysis or limb loss.

In cancer research, the VA is focusing on developing innovative diagnostic tools to identify cancer at earlier stages, which is crucial for improving treatment outcomes. These advancements in detection are expected to lead to more personalized and effective care for veterans.

Additionally, the VA is investigating the effects of aging on health. This research is essential for understanding the unique challenges faced by aging veterans and for creating targeted interventions that improve their overall well-being. By addressing these three areas, VA research is poised to make significant contributions to health care for veterans, enhancing their quality of life and addressing pressing medical needs.
