Welcome to CONNECTIONS, YouthCare’s monthly newsletter highlighting the organization's work and achievements. Interim CEO Marty Hartman leads a transition team focused on stabilizing YouthCare operationally and financially by engaging with youth, staff, and community stakeholders. The aim is to strengthen the financial foundation and enhance organizational stability while protecting vital programs for young people.

A recent highlight includes the graduation of a talented cohort from the On the Rise Commercial Real Estate program, which provided hands-on learning in various fields, aided by workforce partner Porter. The partnership between the Seattle Storm, Starbucks, and YouthCare raised $10,000 through the "Rebounds for Housing" initiative, celebrating the 1,361 rebounds made during the season.

YouthCare expresses gratitude for its volunteers, who are essential to its mission, particularly those from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints who assisted in site clean-up. An upcoming event on December 3 will feature guest speakers and provide an opportunity to connect with YouthCare’s leadership. There are various ways for individuals to get involved, from serving meals to organizing donations, encouraging community support for youth experiencing homelessness.
