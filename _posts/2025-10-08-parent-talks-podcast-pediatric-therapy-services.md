Encompass Pediatric Therapy Services, which provides over 2000 tailored therapy visits each month, was the focus of a recent episode of the Parent Talks podcast. The episode featured the insights of Occupational Therapy Supervisor Lisa Krejci, Speech-Language Supervisor Jim Engracia, and Child and Family Therapist Amber Eckert. They discussed the challenges children might face when seeking services, the structure of therapy sessions, the benefits of multidisciplinary collaboration, and the crucial role of family partnership. The aim of the services is to help children reach their developmental milestones in a supportive environment.
