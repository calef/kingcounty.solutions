  Breast Cancer Awareness Month is a time to reflect, learn, and take action. Every October, communities around the world come together to raise awareness of breast cancer, honor those who have been impacted, and emphasize the importance of early detection. At Snoqualmie Valley Health, we are proud to support this mission by offering advanced screening technology close to home.

  #### Why Screening Matters

  Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women, but early detection saves lives. When breast cancer is found early, treatment is often less invasive, outcomes are more successful, and survival rates are significantly higher. Regular mammograms are one of the most effective tools in finding cancers early, sometimes even before symptoms appear.

  Medical guidelines vary depending on individual risk factors, but for many women of average risk, yearly mammograms starting at age 40 are recommended. If you have a family history of breast cancer or other risk factors, your provider may suggest starting screening earlier. The most important step is to have an ongoing conversation with your healthcare provider about what’s right for you.

  #### Advancing Care with 3D Mammography

  This year, Snoqualmie Valley Health is excited to offer 3D mammography right here in the Valley. Also known as digital breast tomosynthesis, this advanced technology provides a more detailed view of breast tissue, helping detect cancer earlier and more accurately.

  We’ve also invested in powerful AI technology that works alongside our imaging to enhance detection and improve accuracy. And for patient comfort, our system includes the Hologic Soft Comfort Paddle, designed to reduce pressure and make the experience gentler.

  #### Benefits of 3D mammography include:

  - Improved detection of breast cancer, even in dense breast tissue
  - Fewer callbacks for additional imaging, saving time and reducing stress
  - Earlier identification of small cancers
  - A more comfortable exam experience

  By investing in state-of-the-art technology, we’re making it easier and more convenient for our community to prioritize their health.

  #### Take Action This Month

  October is the perfect reminder to schedule your mammogram. Whether it’s your first time or your annual screening, making time for this appointment can make all the difference for you or a loved one.

  At Snoqualmie Valley Health, our team is here to support you every step of the way, from scheduling to results. Together, we can empower our community to take charge of their health and live boldly.
