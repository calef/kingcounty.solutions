October is recognized as Breast Cancer Awareness Month, a time dedicated to raising awareness and emphasizing the importance of early detection of breast cancer. Snoqualmie Valley Health supports this mission and offers advanced screening technology. Regular mammograms, often recommended yearly starting at age 40, are effective in early detection. This year, Snoqualmie Valley Health introduced 3D mammography, also known as digital breast tomosynthesis, providing a detailed view of breast tissue and aiding in early and accurate detection. They also use AI technology to enhance detection and a special system for patient comfort. The community is encouraged to schedule their mammograms.
