  <p>For December, we want to highlight Lauren who like many other volunteers found out about HIP through a close family member.&nbsp;Despite spending almost a year with HIP, she would still describe her first day as the most memorable: &#8220;I just felt so welcomed and comfortable in the kitchen. There was no adjustment period :)&#8221;</p>



  <figure class="wp-block-image alignright is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="https://mcusercontent.com/cd003126e5f5907f30f829eff/images/34434fbb-9f78-a2c6-f15d-d4621ffa4908.jpg" alt="" width="320" height="427"/></figure>



  <p>With a familiar background as a chef, Lauren felt her work as a volunteer for Shelter Meals was meaningful and the results were tangible. She explains: &#8220;&#8230;knowing that at least 60 people will be eating a nutritious and carefully prepared meal just feels good!&#8221; Although she is now retired, her start to volunteering took time amidst her busy schedule: &#8220;I&#8217;ve always wanted to give back to the community but a demanding career and then owning a couple of businesses didn&#8217;t offer me much time or energy to volunteer. We held many fundraising events over the years and it really taught me that every little bit counts and can make a difference. But just giving money, although I know it helped, felt impersonal. I enjoy being of service and I know my skills as a chef are useful.&#8221;</p>



  <p>Her positive relationship with Shelter Meals Leads Alyssa and Rachel also played a part in her positive volunteering experience. She expressed: &#8220;The program is very organized and efficient and Rachel and Alyssa are supportive and kind and care about the&nbsp;volunteers. I want to make their day as easy as I can when I&#8217;m there because they work so hard!&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



  <p>We are boundlessly grateful for Lauren and the work she contributes to the Shelter Meals program, it would not be the same without her!</p>

For December, Lauren is featured as a volunteer spotlight. She discovered Hunger Intervention Program (HIP) through a family member and describes her first day as highly memorable, feeling welcomed and comfortable in the kitchen. With her background as a chef, she finds her role in the Shelter Meals program meaningful, knowing that her efforts help provide nutritious meals to at least 60 people. Although retired, Lauren's journey to volunteering was delayed by her previous demanding career and business ownership. She has always wanted to give back but found that direct involvement felt more impactful than monetary donations. She appreciates the support from Shelter Meals Leads Alyssa and Rachel, noting their kindness and the program's organization. Lauren aims to ease their workload during her volunteer shifts, acknowledging their hard work. Her contributions to the Shelter Meals program are invaluable, and the organization expresses deep gratitude for her efforts.
