The City of Bellevue and King County District Court are launching Bellevue Community Court, an alternative to traditional court aimed at enhancing community safety by holding clients accountable while assisting them in improving their lives. This initiative is set to open in mid-July and is featured in the summer edition of "It's Your City." Other highlights from the newsletter include the opening of a new Adventure Park at Eastgate Park, which replaces the old challenge course with aerial features and a climbing wall. Residents can also look forward to the Bellevue Family 4th celebration, featuring live music and family entertainment, with a reminder to leave fireworks to professionals. Additionally, applications for Bellevue’s fifth annual Tree Giveaway will open on July 25, with updates aimed at increasing tree canopy in underserved areas of the city. "It's Your City" is published three times a year, in February, June, and October.
