The credentials of King County mental health counselor Christopher Salim Duchene have been suspended due to charges of second-degree rape and indecent liberties stemming from allegations of sexual assault against two acquaintances. The suspension prevents him from practicing in Washington while legal proceedings are ongoing. Duchene has 20 days to request a hearing to contest the charges. The Department of Health emphasizes its commitment to public health and safety by regulating health care providers and encourages reporting of unprofessional conduct. Legal documents related to the case are available online or by request.
