Volunteering as a driver for Eastside Friends of Seniors (EFS) offers a meaningful way to connect with and support seniors. A recent experience involved giving a ride to Gilly, a woman in her 70s, highlighting the simplicity and impact of the service. After signing up through the EFS portal, the volunteer arranged the ride and connected with Gilly to finalize details. Upon arrival, the volunteer noticed Gilly's initial anxiety but provided reassurance as they drove to her appointment. Gilly, familiar with the route, expressed relief and gratitude for the assistance, which eases the burden on her distant family. During the return trip, Gilly opened up about her life, showcasing the strong bond formed through these interactions. The volunteer found joy in the sincere expressions of thanks received from those they help, reinforcing the significance of their contribution. Such experiences illustrate how small acts of kindness can profoundly affect the lives of others, promoting independence and emotional support for seniors in the community.
