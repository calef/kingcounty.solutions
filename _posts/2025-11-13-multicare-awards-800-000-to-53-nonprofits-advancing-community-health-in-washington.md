MultiCare Health System has awarded $800,000 in grants to 53 nonprofit organizations throughout Washington state via its Community Partnership Fund. This initiative aims to enhance the health and well-being of local communities, particularly in the Puget Sound, Inland Northwest, and Yakima Valley regions. The funding targets key health challenges identified in MultiCare’s Community Health Needs Assessment, with priorities including access to care, behavioral health, food insecurity, and other social determinants affecting overall health outcomes. MultiCare emphasizes the importance of fostering healthier communities, believing that every community deserves a partner in health and healing. Since its inception in 2014, the Community Partnership Fund has allocated over $6.8 million to numerous nonprofits committed to positively impacting the lives of Washington residents.
