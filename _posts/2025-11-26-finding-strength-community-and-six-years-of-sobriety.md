  <p>At 15, Nadine found herself struggling to adjust to a completely new world. Leaving the familiarity of a small private school and stepping into a large public high school felt overwhelming. Her confidence faded, and anxiety took hold. Was she talking too much? Not enough? Did she say the right thing? On a constant, unending loop, she worried about being judged or about saying the wrong things.</p>
  <blockquote><p>“I didn’t realize the anxiety behaviors I was having weren’t typical. I thought everyone felt nervous all the time.”</p></blockquote>
  <p>To fit in, she turned to substances, something to help quiet the anxiety enough to be able to make new friends. But what started as a way to cope quickly became something heavier and less manageable. Her parents began to notice Nadine wasn’t herself, so they made an appointment for an assessment at Youth Eastside Services.</p>
  <p>At YES, Nadine attended counseling and joined supportive recovery groups like YES’ <span style="color: #ff6600;"><a style="color: #ff6600;" href="https://www.youtheastsideservices.org/services/dialectical-behavioral-therapy/">Dialectical Behavioral Therapy Group</a></span> and <span style="color: #ff6600;"><a style="color: #ff6600;" href="https://www.youtheastsideservices.org/substance-use-treatment-groups/">Seven Challenges</a></span>. There, she met with other peers and learned the language for what she was feeling and that she wasn’t alone in feeling it. She discovered that anxiety doesn’t define someone’s worth and that recovery is a journey built on support.</p>
  <p>Her road wasn’t a straight line. There were moments when the weight felt like too much, and through a referral from YES, Nadine spent four months in an inpatient treatment program. When she returned home during the early days of the pandemic, YES was there to help her continue building her recovery through telehealth support.</p>
  <p>She kept showing up. One day at a time.</p>
  <p>Now 23, and recently graduating from YES services, Nadine celebrated six years sober. She continues therapy and advocates for the care that helps her thrive. She has grown into someone who knows her story matters.</p>
  <blockquote><p>“I feel a lot more confident advocating for myself and understanding what kind of care I need.”</p></blockquote>
  <p>Nadine&#8217;s transformation didn&#8217;t happen overnight. With the support of caring community members like you, YES could be there year after year, as she uncovered her own strength.</p>
  <p>Today, Nadine shares her resilience so that others can find their own:</p>
