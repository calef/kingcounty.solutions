FamilyWorks is embarking on an exciting new chapter with the construction of a new building in Seattle's Greenwood neighborhood, set to open in 2024. This initiative aims to enhance their ability to provide essential services to families in need, including food assistance, parenting support, and community resources. The new facility will feature a dedicated food bank, expanded space for family services, and areas for community gatherings. This project is driven by the goal of fostering a supportive environment for families facing challenges, ensuring they have access to vital resources. The construction is supported by community partners and donations, reflecting a collective commitment to strengthening family welfare in the area. FamilyWorks emphasizes the importance of collaboration and community involvement in achieving their mission, showcasing how collective efforts can lead to meaningful change. The organization looks forward to continuing its work and expanding its reach with the new building, which will serve as a hub for support and connection for families throughout the community.
