Beginning in August 2025, Bellingham's waterfront Cornwall Street features a vibrant mural on the southern wall of Francis Place, a community hub by Catholic Community Services (CCS). Created by artist Joey Rose in collaboration with the Whatcom Community Foundation and Paper Whale, this mural was selected as the grand prize location for the 2024 Noisy Waters Festival. Francis Place provides 42 units of permanent supportive housing for those experiencing homelessness.

The mural incorporates key symbols, including ravens and huckleberry branches. Ravens, significant in various cultural contexts, symbolize transformation, wisdom, and community, while the huckleberry branch represents resilience and belonging. The artwork illustrates pathways of hope, branching out from the huckleberries in the background.

Additionally, the mural honors Will Rice, a former CCS vice president, with his initials subtly included in the design. Rice was an advocate for creating opportunities for hope within CCS communities. The mural invites locals, visitors, and art enthusiasts to appreciate its message of hope, community, and legacy.
