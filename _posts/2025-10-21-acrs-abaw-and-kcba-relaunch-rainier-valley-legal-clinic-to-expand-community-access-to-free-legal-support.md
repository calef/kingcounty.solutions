  <p><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br />
  October 20, 2025</strong></p>
  <p><strong>SEATTLE —</strong> Asian Counseling and Referral Service (ACRS), in partnership with the Asian Bar Association of Washington (ABAW) and the King County Bar Association (KCBA), proudly announces the relaunch of the pro bono <strong>Rainier Valley Legal Clinic</strong>, a vital community resource providing free legal consultations to low-income, immigrant, and refugee community members across the Seattle region.</p>
  <p>The clinic officially reopens on <strong>Wednesday, October 22, 2025</strong>, and will operate on the third Wednesday of each month (October 22, November 19, and December 17) from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m. at ACRS’s main office, 3639 Martin Luther King Jr. Way South, Seattle, WA 98144. Community members must make an appointment in advance by calling <strong>206-695-7639</strong>. Interpretation is available in dozens of languages through ACRS’s on-demand AMN language service, ensuring accurate and culturally responsive legal support regardless of English fluency.</p>
  <p><strong>Reviving a Legacy of Legal Advocacy</strong></p>
  <p>The relaunch of the Rainier Valley Legal Clinic marks the revival of one of ACRS’s earliest community justice initiatives, one that traces back decades to the organization’s first pro bono attorney, John Chen Beckwith, who helped establish a foundation of accessible legal aid for Seattle’s Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (A&amp;NH/PI) communities.</p>
  <p>“This is a full-circle moment for us,” said G De Castro, ACRS Deputy Director. “Access to justice should never depend on income, immigration status, or language ability. This clinic brings that belief to life by connecting clients with volunteer attorneys who not only understand the law but also the lived experiences of the people we serve.”</p>
  <p><strong>Meeting Urgent Needs in Challenging Times</strong></p>
  <p>The clinic’s relaunch comes amid rising community need and shifting federal and state policies that have created uncertainty for immigrant and refugee families. In her recent remarks at the 2025 ACRS Gala, CEO Kendee Yamaguchi underscored the importance of standing firm during these times:</p>
  <p>“Too many of our families are living with fear—fear of deportation, fear of separation, fear of being targeted simply for who they are. When the winds of policy shift, ACRS and our partners will remain standing &#8211; strong, ready, and unwavering.”</p>
  <p>The <strong>Rainier Valley Legal Clinic</strong> operates as part of the <strong>King County Bar Association’s Neighborhood Legal Clinics (NLC)</strong> program, which provides free, limited legal advice and referrals to King County residents and individuals with legal issues in King County. Volunteer attorneys meet with clients by appointment for brief consultations—typically 30 to 60 minutes—to help identify legal issues, explain possible options, and connect clients with appropriate resources or referrals for ongoing support. While the clinic strives to make services accessible regardless of income, language, education, or disability, attorneys may not have expertise in all areas of the law but will make every effort to guide clients toward the help they need. <strong>Clients seeking immigration-related legal help will be referred to community resources and outside immigration attorneys.</strong></p>
  <p><strong>Partnership and Volunteer Opportunities</strong></p>
  <p>Volunteer attorneys from <strong>ABAW, KCBA</strong>, and the broader legal community will staff the clinic, with coordination led by ABAW. Two volunteer attorneys will be present at each session, and the partners are exploring opportunities to engage law students from regional universities in future operations. A formal memorandum of understanding (MOU<strong>)</strong> among partners is expected in October.</p>
  <p>“ABAW has always believed that legal access is a cornerstone of equity,” said Jordan Wada, President of Asian Bar Association of Washington. “By partnering with ACRS and KCBA, we’re creating a space where people can seek help in their own language and know that their rights and dignity are protected.”</p>
  <p>Devon Stark, Neighborhood Legal Clinics Program Manager, echoed the importance of sustained collaboration. “This partnership represents the best of what community lawyering can achieve – bringing together institutions, volunteers, and cultural navigators to ensure justice reaches those who need it most.”</p>

ACRS, in partnership with ABAW and KCBA, has announced the relaunch of the Rainier Valley Legal Clinic to provide free legal consultations to low-income, immigrant, and refugee individuals in the Seattle area. The clinic will reopen on October 22, 2025, and will operate on the third Wednesday of each month from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m. at ACRS’s main office. Appointments are required, and interpretation services will be available in multiple languages.

This initiative revives ACRS’s early community justice efforts, emphasizing that access to justice should not depend on income, immigration status, or language proficiency. The clinic aims to address the rising legal needs of immigrant and refugee families amid changing policies. Volunteer attorneys will provide brief consultations to help identify legal issues and connect clients with resources for ongoing support. 

The clinic also welcomes law students for future operations, reinforcing the importance of community collaboration in providing legal assistance. The partners envision a space where individuals can seek help in their own language and feel secure in their rights and dignity.
