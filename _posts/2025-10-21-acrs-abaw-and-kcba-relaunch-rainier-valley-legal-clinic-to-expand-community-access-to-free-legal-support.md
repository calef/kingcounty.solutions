ACRS, in partnership with ABAW and KCBA, has announced the relaunch of the Rainier Valley Legal Clinic to provide free legal consultations to low-income, immigrant, and refugee individuals in the Seattle area. The clinic will reopen on October 22, 2025, and will operate on the third Wednesday of each month from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m. at ACRS’s main office. Appointments are required, and interpretation services will be available in multiple languages.

This initiative revives ACRS’s early community justice efforts, emphasizing that access to justice should not depend on income, immigration status, or language proficiency. The clinic aims to address the rising legal needs of immigrant and refugee families amid changing policies. Volunteer attorneys will provide brief consultations to help identify legal issues and connect clients with resources for ongoing support. 

The clinic also welcomes law students for future operations, reinforcing the importance of community collaboration in providing legal assistance. The partners envision a space where individuals can seek help in their own language and feel secure in their rights and dignity.
