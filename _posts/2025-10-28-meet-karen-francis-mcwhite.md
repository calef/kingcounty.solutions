Karen Francis-McWhite has joined the Inatai Foundation as a Strategy & Impact Program Officer. With a diverse background, she transitioned from higher education to law and government in 2012, working on rural economic development and navigating COVID-19 recovery in Central Washington. Her career focuses on healing communities from past harms, aligning with Inatai's mission. Karen describes herself as curious, personable, and geeky, and is eager to learn from and support marginalized communities across Washington and the Pacific Northwest.

As a Black middle-aged mother in rural Washington, Karen is passionate about gardening, Nordic skiing, wine tasting, and hiking. She believes in the resilience and creativity of her community, which inspires her hope for the future. Her favorite Washingtonian is Mary Posey, a pioneer who overcame significant challenges in the late 1800s. Karen enjoys spending time with her daughter, exploring new restaurants, and gardening when she’s not at work. She also recommends the podcast series “What Roman Mars Can Learn About Con Law” for its engaging content.
