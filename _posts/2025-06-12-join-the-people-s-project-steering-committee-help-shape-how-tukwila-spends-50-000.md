The City of Tukwila, Washington, is inviting residents to join the People’s Project Steering Committee to guide the city's first Participatory Budgeting process. The committee will help shape an inclusive process that empowers community members to decide how the city invests in small, resident-driven projects. The city has allocated $50,000 for projects such as benches, water fountains, public art, or safety improvements. Committee members, who will receive a stipend for their contributions, will attend monthly meetings, design the idea collection and voting process, and ensure the process is accessible and community-centered. The deadline to apply is June 30.
