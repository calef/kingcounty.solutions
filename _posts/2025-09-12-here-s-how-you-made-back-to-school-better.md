Heading back to school can be challenging for children from struggling families, as it highlights the disparities in resources. However, this year, over 100 children and teenagers living in Solid Ground housing received support through community generosity. The "Pack it Forward" initiative resulted in more than 150 backpacks filled with school supplies, along with cash donations that bolster Solid Ground's programs. 

At Sand Point Housing, home to 180 individuals and families affected by homelessness, families explored school supply options before attending a financial education session provided by Chase Bank. They also enjoyed a hamburger lunch from Dick’s Drive-in. Similarly, families at the Broadview Shelter and Transitional Housing, which supports around 100 families escaping homelessness and domestic violence, also received supplies. These efforts created a joyful atmosphere, marking a successful transition into the school year.

The article expresses gratitude to community partners such as the Washington Athletic Club, University District Rotary, and others for their support. It encourages continued involvement, emphasizing that the need persists beyond the start of the school year, and invites contributions to help combat poverty in Seattle and King County.
