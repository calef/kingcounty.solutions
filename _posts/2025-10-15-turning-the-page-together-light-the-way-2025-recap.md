The annual Light the Way Luncheon celebrated community impact and the resilience of those experiencing homelessness. Attendees shared powerful stories, including Programs Coordinator Aania Simpkin's personal experience with homelessness and Glen's transition from living in his car to securing a home. These narratives underscored the potential for transformation through compassion and community support. The event highlighted the importance of collaboration among guests, donors, volunteers, and staff, all united by the belief that everyone deserves a chance for a better life. 

During the luncheon, the Steve Roberts Partnership Award was presented to St. Monica Friends of the Needy, acknowledging their longstanding commitment to providing nourishment and support to the community. For those unable to attend, the event's impact continues, with opportunities for donations and volunteer work available to support men experiencing homelessness in East King County. The initiative encourages ongoing involvement to help individuals achieve stability and dignity, emphasizing that collective efforts can indeed illuminate the path toward a brighter future for those in need.
