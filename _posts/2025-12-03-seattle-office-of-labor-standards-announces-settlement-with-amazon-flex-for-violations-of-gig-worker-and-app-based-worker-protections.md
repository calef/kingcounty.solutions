The Seattle Office of Labor Standards has announced a settlement with Amazon Flex regarding violations of protections for gig workers and app-based employees. The settlement follows an investigation that revealed Amazon Flex failed to provide required information about workers' rights, resulting in potential misclassification of workers. Additionally, the company did not comply with regulations related to minimum wage and paid sick leave. 

As part of the settlement, Amazon Flex will pay $1.3 million in restitution to affected workers, along with a $350,000 civil penalty. The settlement aims to enhance compliance with labor laws and ensure that gig workers receive the protections they are entitled to. Seattle's commitment to protecting workers' rights is emphasized through this action, reinforcing the importance of accountability for companies operating in the gig economy. The Office of Labor Standards remains vigilant in enforcing labor laws to safeguard workers in various sectors.
