Celebrating Mother’s Day at Atlantic Street Center emphasizes community building and self-value for families. In 2024, the Teens as Young Parents Program and Kinship Care Support Group experienced special "days of beauty," featuring aestheticians who provided eyelash applications, makeup, and facials. Local spa Holistic Coalition contributed by offering massages, including prenatal options. A participant expressed gratitude, noting it was her first experience with eyelash extensions, which made her feel positive and special. The relaxing facial and hand massage served as a reminder of the importance of self-care. Atlantic Street Center's support for youth and families is adaptable, addressing practical needs like job hunting, preschool access, and food availability, while also fostering a nurturing environment. These initiatives create a safe space for participants to honor themselves and take a moment to slow down amidst their busy lives.
