  Celebrating Mother’s Day is a big deal at Atlantic Street Center. Because we support so many families, it is important our team creates opportunities to build community. This includes reminding our participants that they have value and deserve to honor themselves.

  For Mother’s Day 2024, our Teens as Young Parents Program and Kinship Care Support Group were given days of beauty. We had aestheticians come in to apply eyelashes and make up, as well as administer facials. Holistic Coalition, a local spa, also gave out massages, including pre-natal.

  “Thank you kindly for all the beautiful work you put into making us Moms feel special,” said a Teens as Young Parents participant. “It was the first time I’ve ever had my lashes done in my lifetime. It gave me a totally different, positive look. I felt happy and cute for a day. The magical relaxing facial and hand massage was a reminder how I need to love and care for myself more!”

  The support that Atlantic Street Center provides to youth and families is fluid and flexible. Of course, we work with participants to help them with objectives like job hunting, finding open and equitable preschools, and even with food accessibility. There is still a need to create comfort and a sense of community. These programs are a safe haven for our participants to honor themselves and intentionally slow down.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Celebrating Mother’s Day at Atlantic Street Center emphasizes community building and self-value for families. In 2024, the Teens as Young Parents Program and Kinship Care Support Group experienced special "days of beauty," featuring aestheticians who provided eyelash applications, makeup, and facials. Local spa Holistic Coalition contributed by offering massages, including prenatal options. A participant expressed gratitude, noting it was her first experience with eyelash extensions, which made her feel positive and special. The relaxing facial and hand massage served as a reminder of the importance of self-care. Atlantic Street Center's support for youth and families is adaptable, addressing practical needs like job hunting, preschool access, and food availability, while also fostering a nurturing environment. These initiatives create a safe space for participants to honor themselves and take a moment to slow down amidst their busy lives.
