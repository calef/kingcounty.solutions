The Seattle City Council has adopted the 2026 budget, emphasizing support for a thriving and inclusive business ecosystem. The budget aims to attract new industries and assist local businesses in growth and innovation while addressing economic disparities. Key initiatives funded by the Office of Economic Development (OED) include efforts to improve the business environment for grocery stores, making it easier and more affordable for them to operate in Seattle, and enhancing access to healthy foods. The Back to Business program will receive an additional $2.5 million to assist small businesses affected by vandalism and crime, bringing total funding to $3.2 million. This funding will also support neighborhood-level improvements. Additionally, the budget includes a pilot program in Little Saigon to stabilize and invest in local neighborhoods by coordinating city services and addressing public safety concerns. Overall, the 2026 budget totals approximately $40.3 million, reflecting a commitment to economic development and community engagement.
