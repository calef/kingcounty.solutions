The standards will impact roadways, sidewalks, street layouts, bike paths, and landscaping. A public hearing will be held on October 14, 2025, where residents can attend in person or virtually to contribute comments. In other news, the city is also discussing the future of the City Hall, which was originally built in the 1950s and later converted to City Hall in the late 1980s.
