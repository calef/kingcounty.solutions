original_content: "By Steven Schauer, Deputy Executive Director\n\nAs the ghosts and goblins come out for Halloween, there’s another kind of fright creeping into King County – flood season! From October through April, rain-swollen rivers and rising groundwater can turn your neighborhood into something straight out of a horror movie. But unlike haunted houses or eerie fog, this is one “scare” you can prepare for.\n\nJust like you wouldn’t face a zombie apocalypse without a plan, you shouldn’t face flood season unprepared. So, grab your flashlight, put on your brave face, and get ready for a frightfully smart way to stay safe this Halloween.\n\n![](https://kingcountyfloodcontrol.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Snoqualmie-River-11-06-credit-KC.jpg)\n_Snoqualmie River Nov. 2006 flooding.

Flooding is King County’s most common natural disaster, and while it doesn’t come with jump scares or spooky music, it can cause serious damage to homes, roads, and businesses.\n\nThe good news? Unlike the villain in a horror film, you can stop flooding from catching you off guard with a little preparedness magic.\n\n![](https://kingcountyfloodcontrol.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Bear-Creek-and-Sammamish-River-2-20-credit-KC-1024x682.jpg)\n_Bear Creek entering the Sammamish River during Feb. 2020 flooding.

Don’t wait until it’s too late!\n- **Create an emergency kit.** Pack essentials like flashlights, first aid, food, and water in a waterproof bin. (Bonus points for glow sticks – they’re Halloween festive _and_ practical.)\n- **Plan your escape route.** Practice how you’d safely evacuate. No one wants to end up the star of _“Night of the Rising Waters.”_\n\n![](https://kingcountyfloodcontrol.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cedar-river-11-95-credit-KC.jpg)\n_Cedar River Nov. 1995 flooding.

Follow these lifesaving treats of advice:\n\n- **Turn around, don’t drown!** Just 12 inches of water can sweep you off your feet – or your car off the road.\n- **Listen for emergency alerts** and leave immediately if told to evacuate.\n- **Shut off utilities** only if it’s safe to do so and never wade through floodwater – you don’t want to find out what’s lurking below.\n\nIf you can’t evacuate safely, call 911 and move to higher ground with a flashlight and phone.\n\n![](https://kingcountyfloodcontrol.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/White-river-1-09-credit-KC.jpg)\n_White River Jan. 2009 flooding.

Floodwater can hide contamination, structural damage, and electrical hazards, all of which can be a real nightmare for homeowners!\n\n- **Wait for the all-clear** before reentering your home.\n- **Have professionals inspect** your utilities.\n- **Document everything.** Take photos, record high-water marks, and contact your insurance agent right away.\n- **Clean up safely.** Gloves, boots, and protective clothing aren’t just for costumes!\n\n![](https://kingcountyfloodcontrol.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/green-river-11-59-credit-KC-1024x791.jpg)\n_Green River Nov. 1959 flooding.

These resources provide practical tips on how to prepare before, during, and after a flood, and no crystal ball required!\n\nFloods are no treat, but being prepared is the ultimate trick. So, this Halloween, don’t let Mother Nature play the villain in your story.\n\nStay informed, stay safe, and remember: **It’s always better to be prepared than petrified.**\n\n> ![\U0001F47B](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f47b.png) **Happy Halloween from the King County Flood Control District — where we fight floods, not fright!**\n\nThe post [\U0001F383 Don’t Get Spooked by Flood Season: Be Flood Ready This Halloween](https://kingcountyfloodcontrol.org/%f0%9f%8e%83-dont-get-spooked-by-flood-season-be-flood-ready-this-halloween/) appeared first on [King County Flood Control District](https://kingcountyfloodcontrol.org)."

Residents are advised to know their flood risk, sign up for flood alerts, purchase flood insurance, create an emergency kit, and plan an escape route.
