Volunteer Nick has made significant contributions to the Senior Community Meal program for nearly eight years. He became involved after learning about Hunger Intervention Program (HIP) through founder Jerry Berger at his church. Volunteering has become a vital routine for Nick in his retirement, providing him with social interaction and a sense of purpose. As a front-facing volunteer, he engages with seniors, witnessing their developing relationships and interactions. Nick enjoys the camaraderie among HIP staff and fellow volunteers, and he appreciates the physical activity involved in setting up and taking down tables. He encourages others to consider volunteering, especially retirees looking to stay active and engaged in their communities. Nick’s dedicated presence is felt every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and his story serves as an inspiration for community involvement.
