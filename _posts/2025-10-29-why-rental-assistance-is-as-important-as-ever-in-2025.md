  <p>We have all been hit with an unplanned bill or put in an unexpected financial situation at what seems like the worst possible time.

  <p>The most common reasons for missing rent payments include:</p>

  <li>Job loss or cut hours</li>

  <h2>Community Roots’ Rental Assistance Programs</h2>
  <p>Rental assistance works. That is why Community Roots Housing operates two in-house rental assistance programs: the Housing Stabilization Program and the Emergency Assistance Fund. Each is uniquely designed so that Community Roots residents can get the help they need, when they need it. <strong>Over 100 Community Roots households were supported this year with rental assistance.</strong></p>
  <h3>The Housing Stabilization Program</h3>
  <p>The Housing Stabilization Program (HSP) works to address the “why” behind some of our residents&#8217; chronic economic insecurity that prevents them from staying on top of their rent payments. Modest or fixed incomes make it difficult to keep pace with Seattle’s rapidly rising costs of living. To prioritize essential needs such as food, childcare, or healthcare, residents can find themselves consistently falling behind on rent. While most traditional rental assistance programs focus on short-term relief, the HSP focuses on the root causes of housing instability.</p>
  <p>Through the HSP, residents receive rental assistance of up to $7,000 to relieve the immediate burden of accumulated arrears. Just as importantly, each household develops an individualized Housing Stability Plan with a Community Roots Resident Services Coordinator. These plans help identify and address the underlying challenges that lead to financial hardship, connecting residents with resources such as public benefits, childcare, or job opportunities. Residents also participate in group financial coaching sessions to strengthen budgeting and money management skills. <strong>Over $100,000 in Housing Stabilization funds were disbursed to Community Roots households in 2025.</strong></p>
  <h3>The Emergency Rental Assistance Program</h3>
  <p>Community Roots Housing households earn an average of $33,000 per year, making unplanned expenses — like an urgent car repair or unexpected medical bill — difficult to manage on top of existing bills. The <a href="https://communityrootshousing.org/current-residents/resident-services/emergency-rental-assistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Emergency Rental Assistance</a> (ERA) Program provides just-in-time support to households that are at risk of falling behind on rent due to an unforeseen financial setback. The program is designed as short-term and low barrier, preventing a one-time, emergency expense from snowballing into housing crisis. Residents can request up to one month’s rent in assistance funds. <strong>Community Roots has awarded over $50,000 and counting of Emergency Rental Assistance funds this year.</strong></p>

Community Roots Housing offers vital rental assistance through two programs: the Housing Stabilization Program (HSP) and the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) Program. These initiatives aim to support residents facing economic hardships that could lead to homelessness due to missed rent payments. Common causes for these financial struggles include job loss, medical expenses, and caregiving responsibilities.

The HSP addresses chronic economic insecurity by providing up to $7,000 in rental assistance and developing individualized Housing Stability Plans with service coordinators. These plans focus on underlying issues and connect residents to resources like public benefits and job opportunities, along with financial coaching to improve budgeting skills. In 2025, over $100,000 was allocated to assist more than 100 households.

The ERA Program offers timely support for those at risk of falling behind on rent due to unexpected expenses, allowing residents to request up to one month’s rent. This year, over $50,000 has been distributed through this program. Both initiatives rely on funding from private foundations, U.S. Bank, and individual donations, highlighting the importance of community support in maintaining housing stability for vulnerable residents.
