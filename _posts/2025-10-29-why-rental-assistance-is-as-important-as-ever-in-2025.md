Community Roots Housing offers vital rental assistance through two programs: the Housing Stabilization Program (HSP) and the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) Program. These initiatives aim to support residents facing economic hardships that could lead to homelessness due to missed rent payments. Common causes for these financial struggles include job loss, medical expenses, and caregiving responsibilities.

The HSP addresses chronic economic insecurity by providing up to $7,000 in rental assistance and developing individualized Housing Stability Plans with services coordinators. These plans focus on underlying issues and connect residents to resources like public benefits and job opportunities, along with financial coaching to improve budgeting skills. In 2025, over $100,000 was allocated to assist more than 100 households.

The ERA Program offers timely support for those at risk of falling behind on rent due to unexpected expenses, allowing residents to request up to one month’s rent. This year, over $50,000 has been distributed through this program. Both initiatives rely on funding from private foundations, U.S. Bank, and individual donations, highlighting the importance of community support in maintaining housing stability for vulnerable residents.
