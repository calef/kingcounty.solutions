Shaun Vallery, an Iraq War veteran, serves as the Program Manager on LCSNW's Clinic-based Mental Health Team in Yamhill County. His experience in the U.S. Air Force security forces has profoundly influenced his counseling approach, allowing him to build strong relationships with clients through skills developed in law enforcement. Inspired by the response to the Columbine High School shooting, Shaun pursued a career in law enforcement and served in a Quick Response Force during his tour in Iraq. After 13 years in the military, he transitioned to military law enforcement and trained young soldiers, often working with those suffering from PTSD. After returning to his hometown of Newberg, Oregon, he earned a master’s in counseling from George Fox University and initially worked for Columbia County Mental Health. In July 2024, he joined LCSNW, where he quickly advanced to Program Manager. His practice incorporates Trauma Informed Care principles, and he holds a certification as an alcohol and drug counselor. Shaun takes pride in mentoring new counselors and is recognized for his dedication to serving veterans, clients, and colleagues with compassion and professionalism as Veterans Day approaches.
