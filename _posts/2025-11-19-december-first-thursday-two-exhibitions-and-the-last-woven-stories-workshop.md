Join the festivities at ARTS at King Street Station on December 4 for Pioneer Square's First Thursday Artwalk, featuring the opening of two exhibitions: "Living & Loving Under the Carceral State" and "Welcome to Paradise: ¡Viva Puerto Rico Libre!". The evening will also include the final workshop in the Woven Stories series, where participants can create Huichol Ojos de Dios, guided by Alicia Mullikin.

"Living & Loving Under the Carceral State" explores the experiences of women supporting incarcerated loved ones, highlighting the emotional and cultural significance of their art as a means of healing and empowerment amidst the challenges posed by mass incarceration.

"Welcome to Paradise: ¡Viva Puerto Rico Libre!" critiques the romanticized image of Puerto Rico by revealing the impacts of colonization, U.S. governance, and disaster capitalism. The exhibition uses various artistic elements to engage viewers with deeper social truths, including installations that juxtapose spectacle with critical commentary.

The gallery is open from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesday through Saturday, extending to 8 p.m. on First Thursdays.
