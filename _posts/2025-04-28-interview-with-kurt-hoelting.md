Kurt Hoelting, author of *Apprentice to the Wild*, reflects on his life as a commercial fisherman and wilderness guide in Southeast Alaska. He emphasizes the relationship between risk and human experience, noting that while he has taken risks, they have been measured and rooted in a deep appreciation for nature. Hoelting argues that understanding risk is essential for survival, especially as modern society distances itself from the skills necessary for resilience. He believes that embracing vulnerability and mortality is crucial, advocating for kindness as a spiritual practice that transcends religious boundaries. The cultivation of compassion is central to his vocation, which includes roles as a writer and teacher within various spiritual communities. Hoelting stresses that in today's chaotic environment, it is vital to stay present and practice awareness and kindness. He suggests that managing our inner wildness involves regulating our thoughts and emotions in real time, transforming negativity into connection and healing. Ultimately, he views the practice of kindness and compassion as fundamental to living a meaningful life.
