  the opening passages of the book, I was struck by your relationship with risk-taking—not
  merely the acceptance of risk but, to some degree, your active pursuit of it. What
  would you say about that relationship and its importance?</strong></p>\n<p>Throughout
  my life, I have been fascinated by the relationship between risk and competence,
  risk and the scope of what we are capable of experiencing as human beings. While
  I took some foolish risks as an outdoorsman in my youth, as epitomized by the LeConte
  Bay story in my book, I do not see myself as having pursued gratuitous risks in
  my work as a fisherman and wilderness guide. I just loved living near the wild edge
  of nature, and I took pride in honing the skills required to navigate those edges
  well. It gave me a kind of membership in a much broader scope of human experience
  across time.</p>\n<p>To subsist on this earth through the majority of human time
  was to live constantly with a level of risk that is difficult for us to imagine
  today. The risks I took were modest in comparison to what hunter/gatherer cultures
  took for granted, and in some ways we have placed ourselves at risk by losing touch
  with the kinds of skills and knowledge of place that we will need for survival as
  global supply chains break down.</p>\n<p>On a more spiritual level, our capacity
  to embrace the truth of our human vulnerability and mortality requires us to accept
  risk as an intrinsic element in every human life. The transient nature of our lives
  entails risk: We cannot know in what moment, or by what means, our lives will end.
  To turn the other cheek is a risky choice. To offer love in the face of hate or
  intolerance is a risky choice. To stand up for justice when no one else is willing
  to do so is a hugely risky choice. Yet any life well lived requires just that.</p>\n<p><strong>Your
  personal evolution has led you into Christian ministry and then away from or beyond
  it. And yet your roles as writer, guide, and elder retain strong elements of ministry.
  How have you come to understand your vocation, the persistent aspects and the ones
  that have found new direction? </strong></p>\n<p>The Dalai Lama has famously said,
  “My religion is kindness.” I have gravitated in my spiritual orientation away from
  rigid dogmas and orthodoxies in any form, and toward a religion rooted in kindness,
  and the cultivation of kindness. All great religions have the practice of kindness
  at their core, so it is not a matter of one faith over against another, when kindness
  and compassion are the motivating factors. In that sense, I have never felt far
  from my calling as a minister.</p>\n<p>I have worked a lot with Christian and Jewish
  faith practitioners, as well as Buddhist practitioners, and have been a teacher
  in the more secular mindfulness community as well. For me, the path toward the cultivation
  of compassion and kindness intrinsic to Buddhist meditation practices has been especially
  helpful in moving from abstract beliefs in the value of kindness, to the hard work
  of actually manifesting kindness. And yet I have no need to call myself a Buddhist,
  or renounce my affiliation with the Christian path. For me it is less a matter of
  “faith&#8221; than of “practice&#8221;.</p>\n<p><strong>Do you think the encounter
  with the wild, within and without, has particular relevance to the time we are living? </strong></p>\n<p>Absolutely.
  Especially now. From the standpoint of evolutionary biology, the human species emerged
  out of the same wild forces as every other species, and we are still learning how
  to manage and control the inner wildness of our nature. When things seem to be going
  crazy, and the level of chaos in our lives is high, as it certainly is right now,
  it is all the more important to stay rooted in present-moment awareness, and to
  cultivate kind attention in relation to the actual moment we are in.</p>\n<p>For
  me, tending to the “wild within” is code language for skillfully inhabiting our
  direct experience of the moment at hand, and whatever difficulties and opportunities
  it presents. Often what that actually means, when the chips are down, is dealing
  with difficult or catastrophizing thoughts and emotions in real time, using the
  skills of our spiritual practice to self-regulate and re-engage the better angels
  of our nature—also in real time. That is easy to say but hard to do.</p>\n<p>The
  negativity bias of our brains is a dominant part of what makes us wild creatures,
  because it ties us back to earlier, more primitive and reactive parts of our inherited
  “wild” nature. But it is also a part of our nature to have ready access to compassion
  and empathy, and to turn our negativity bias back toward connection and healing.
  I often think that this is the highest and best use of any authentic spiritual practice,
  or of any authentic practicing community.</p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div></div></div></div></div></div>\n</div>"

Kurt Hoelting, author of *Apprentice to the Wild*, reflects on his life as a commercial fisherman and wilderness guide in Southeast Alaska. He emphasizes the relationship between risk and human experience, noting that while he has taken risks, they have been measured and rooted in a deep appreciation for nature. Hoelting argues that understanding risk is essential for survival, especially as modern society distances itself from the skills necessary for resilience. He believes that embracing vulnerability and mortality is crucial, advocating for kindness as a spiritual practice that transcends religious boundaries. The cultivation of compassion is central to his vocation, which includes roles as a writer and teacher within various spiritual communities. Hoelting stresses that in today's chaotic environment, it is vital to stay present and practice awareness and kindness. He suggests that managing our inner wildness involves regulating our thoughts and emotions in real time, transforming negativity into connection and healing. Ultimately, he views the practice of kindness and compassion as fundamental to living a meaningful life.
