  you’re struggling with an alcohol or drug addiction, simply admitting that you need
  help is an accomplishment. Once you’ve made that commitment to yourself, it’s important
  to find the type of treatment that’s right for you. The continuum of addiction care
  ranges from residential inpatient treatment to outpatient treatment. This means
  that no matter what stage of substance use disorder you may be experiencing, you’ll
  be able to find the type of program that fits your needs and goals. Two types of
  treatment programs are often confused: Intensive Outpatient Programs, known as IOPs,
  and outpatient treatment. In this blog, we’ll discuss how IOP programs and outpatient
  programs are alike, how they’re different, what purposes they serve, and how to
  choose the program that’s right for you.</p>\n<h2>Addiction Treatment Levels of
  Care</h2>\n<p>As you begin your research into treatment programs, you’ll learn that
  there are different addiction treatment levels of care. The American Society of
  Addiction Medicine recognizes <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK64088/\">five
  levels of addiction care</a>. In order of increasing intensity, the types of substance
  abuse programs are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Early intervention services</li>\n<li>Outpatient
  treatment</li>\n<li>Intensive Outpatient Programs and Partial Hospitalization Programs</li>\n<li>Inpatient
  treatment</li>\n<li>Medically managed inpatient treatment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These
  levels of care differ in requirements, types of services, time commitment, and facility
  settings. The point at which you enter the continuum of addiction care depends on
  your unique circumstances, including your stage of addiction, any co-occurring diagnoses,
  your overall health, your financial situation, and other factors.</p>\n<h2>What
  Is Outpatient Treatment?</h2>\n<p>Outpatient treatment is the lowest level of care
  for drug and alcohol addiction. In an outpatient program, you’ll spend less than
  nine hours per week in treatment. Usually this means you’ll go to one or two sessions
  per week. Sessions are offered during the day and at night so you can fit treatment
  around your other obligations.  Treatment usually consists of individual counselling
  sessions, group therapy, and educational classes. Outpatient treatment is a good
  option for people who have completed inpatient treatment or an Intensive Outpatient
  Program, as well as for those who need extra support after a relapse.</p>\n<h2>What
  Is an IOP Program?</h2>\n<p>IOP stands for Intensive Outpatient Program. You may
  also hear it called an IOP program. These programs are considered “intensive” because
  an IOP program typically offers high levels of medical and psychological support
  similar to those found in inpatient treatment, but without the requirement that
  you live at the treatment facility. “Intensive” also refers to the amount of time
  you spend in treatment. With an IOP program, you’ll participate in at least ten
  hours of treatment per week. Treatment sessions usually include individual therapy,
  group therapy, medication management, and psychoeducation. Because of the high level
  of support an IOP program provides, it’s where many people choose to begin their
  recovery journey.</p>\n<h2>IOP vs. Outpatient: How Long Do They Take?</h2>\n<p>Addiction
  treatment is highly individual. The length of time you spend in treatment will be
  determined by your unique needs, goals, and progress. Both IOP programs and outpatient
  treatment programs can last anywhere from several weeks to three months, depending
  on how you’re engaging in and responding to treatment. Outpatient treatment may
  last longer than 90 days with the intensity and time commitment decreasing as your
  coping skills get stronger and you successfully reintegrate into your daily life.</p>\n<h2>IOP
  vs. Outpatient: How Many Hours a Week Will I Go?</h2>\n<p>Program specifics will
  vary depending on the treatment facility you choose, but in general, outpatient
  treatment is the least restrictive level of addiction care. Outpatient substance
  abuse treatment programs require you to attend sessions for eight or fewer hours
  per week. These eight hours are spread out over three to five days depending on
  the types of treatment sessions you attend. Because it’s just a few hours per day
  for a few days per week, outpatient treatment gives you the freedom and flexibility
  to fit treatment around your everyday life.</p>\n<p>IOP programs typically require
  you to attend treatment a minimum of nine hours per week. These sessions are also
  spread out over several days each week. You may also be required to attend peer
  support group meetings in addition to your treatment sessions. IOP programs do allow
  you to live at home, go to school, and work, but they require more of your time
  so are somewhat more restrictive.</p>\n<h2>IOP vs. Outpatient: Types of Therapies</h2>\n<p>While
  there is some overlap of services between outpatient treatment programs and IOP
  programs, IOP programs typically require you to spend more time in treatment, increasing
  the intensity of treatment. Outpatient treatment services vary from facility to
  facility, but most programs offer services such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Individual therapy</li>\n<li>Group
  therapy</li>\n<li>Family therapy</li>\n<li>Education sessions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The
  services offered by IOP programs also differ depending on facility, but most IOP
  programs include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Individual therapy</li>\n<li>Group therapy</li>\n<li>Family
  therapy</li>\n<li>Behavioral therapy</li>\n<li>Medication management</li>\n<li>Monitoring
  and evaluation</li>\n<li>Alcohol/drug testing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some people may also
  receive job training and assistance with housing as part of an IOP program.</p>\n<h2>How
  Effective Is an IOP Program?</h2>\n<p>Research has shown that for most people, an
  IOP program can be as effective as inpatient treatment in addressing substance use
  disorder. In <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4152944/#:~:text=IOPs%20are%20an%20important%20part,as%20a%20covered%20health%20benefit.\">one
  study</a>, people who had gone through an inpatient program and people who had completed
  an IOP program all reported similar reductions in the severity of their addiction
  and increases in sobriety maintenance. We know that, overall, the longer you spend
  in treatment, the more successful you’ll be at maintaining your sobriety. Because
  IOP programs last longer than inpatient treatment, they can give you a better chance
  at long-term success.</p>\n<p>Outpatient treatment offers less support and structure,
  so it’s usually not a good fit for people who are entering treatment for the first
  time. Outpatient treatment is a good next step for those who have completed an IOP
  program or PHP program and have well-developed coping skills and an established
  support system.</p>\n<h2>Individualization</h2>\n<p>No matter what type of program
  you choose, finding one that is tailored to your personal needs and goals is critical
  to your long-term success. Look for a facility and program that utilizes proven,
  evidence-based therapies and treatments to address your specific addiction and circumstances,
  including any co-occurring disorders, your stage of addiction, the availability
  of your support system, and the environment in which you’re currently living.</p>\n<h2>IOP
  vs. Outpatient: What Will Insurance Cover?</h2>\n<p>Different plans and policies
  have different levels of coverage, making it difficult to provide a simple answer
  to this question. Most insurance policies will cover both outpatient treatment and
  IOP programs if you’re referred by a doctor or other medical professional. As part
  of your treatment facility selection process, find out what insurance carriers and
  plans they accept. Most treatment facilities will help you navigate insurance and
  payment options.</p>\n<h2>Virtual IOP Programs</h2>\n<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic,
  many facilities adapted their outpatient programs so that people could receive treatment
  online. This adaptation has made treatment available to people who couldn’t otherwise
  participate, so online IOP programs and online outpatient programs have become more
  commonplace. Many facilities offer outpatient treatment via video calls or telephone
  calls. If you’re considering virtual outpatient care, make sure that the facility
  you choose uses HIPAA-compliant technology so that your private information is safe
  and secure.</p>\n<h2>IOP vs. Outpatient: How Do I Choose?</h2>\n<p>If you’re entering
  treatment for the first time or looking for your next step after inpatient treatment,
  you likely need more support and structure than outpatient treatment can provide.
  An IOP program offers a wider range of services, more time in treatment, and more
  personal attention than outpatient treatment, making it a good choice for those
  who need extra support in the early days of sobriety.</p>\n<p>Outpatient treatment
  works best for people who have already completed inpatient treatment and/or an IOP
  program and are better equipped to handle the freedom that an outpatient treatment
  schedule provides.</p>\n<h2>IOP Program: A Bridge Between Inpatient Treatment and
  Outpatient Care</h2>\n<p>At Lakeside-Milam, our Intensive Outpatient Program is
  designed to provide a bridge between inpatient treatment and outpatient care. Long-term
  participation in treatment improves your chances for long-term sobriety, so whether
  you’re entering treatment for the first time, seeking extra support after a relapse,

---

Intensive outpatient programs (IOP) and outpatient treatment are two different approaches to addiction treatment. IOP is designed for individuals who require more support than traditional outpatient services but do not need 24/7 care. It typically involves multiple sessions each week, focusing on therapy, counseling, and skill-building. Patients may engage in group and individual sessions, allowing for a structured environment while still maintaining some independence.

Outpatient treatment, on the other hand, offers greater flexibility and is suitable for those with less severe addiction issues. Patients attend sessions less frequently, which can include therapy and support groups, but they do not have the same level of intensity as IOP. Outpatient treatment is often a step down from more intensive programs, allowing individuals to integrate their recovery into daily life.

Both options are effective depending on the patient’s needs, severity of addiction, and personal circumstances. Choosing between IOP and outpatient treatment requires careful consideration of the individual’s situation and may involve consultation with healthcare professionals to determine the best path for recovery.
