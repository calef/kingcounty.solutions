  On June 27, Wellspring’s Community Room transformed into a place of joy, pride, and tiny capes as 11 young learners marched across the stage in caps, gowns, and superhero masks. It was a momentous day for our 2025 graduates and their families, marking the culmination of their journey in Wellspring’s Early Learning Center (ELC), where early education meets stability and wraparound support for the whole family.

  This year’s graduation theme, _Superhero!_, was more than just fun. It was a celebration of the strength, imagination, and resilience that each child brought to the classroom every day. _“Every child who walks through our doors has superpowers—curiosity, creativity, and an ability to overcome_,” said Kelly Shepherd-Martin, Director of the Early Learning Center. “_Graduation isn’t just about what they’ve learned—it’s about what’s possible when children and families are surrounded by care, community, and opportunity.”_

  Wellspring’s ELC is more than a preschool. It’s a trauma-informed, whole-family program designed to serve children ages one to five who are navigating their experiences around housing instability. While children receive individualized early education, their parents and caregivers gain access to resources, assistance, and family support services. It’s this wraparound model that helps make long-term stability possible.

  From a no-expulsion policy that meets children’s emotional and behavioral needs to one-on-one support for caregivers, every element of the program is built to create security, consistency, and connection.

  “_We’re_ _honored to walk alongside families as they work toward their goals,“_ Kelly added. _“They are the heroes in their own story—we’re simply here to offer support, encouragement, and the resources they need along the way.”_

  As the graduates beamed with pride and posed for photos in their superhero attire, the moment reflected something deeper than celebration—it marked a turning point. Programs like Wellspring’s ELC don’t just prepare children for kindergarten; they help lay the groundwork for long-term stability, emotional resilience, and brighter futures. By supporting families alongside their children, the ELC empowers entire households to take meaningful steps toward achieving their goals.

  While the impact is clear, the path forward for many early learning programs in the community is at risk. These critical services are subject to changing federal and state budget priorities, which can affect the availability of support that families rely on. The _Early_ Early Childhood Education Assistance Program (Early ECEAP) for children aged one to three years old has already been eliminated across the state, and Wellspring’s ECEAP program has also seen a substantial reduction in funding for the remaining programs going into the next school year. But with strong community support and advocacy, programs like Wellspring’s ELC can continue to thrive, ensuring more children and families have access to the stability and support they need to succeed.

On June 27, Wellspring’s Community Room hosted a joyful graduation ceremony for 11 young learners from the Early Learning Center (ELC), themed "Superhero!" Graduates donned caps, gowns, and superhero masks, celebrating their journey in a program that provides early education alongside stability and support for families facing housing instability. Director Kelly Shepherd-Martin emphasized that each child possesses unique "superpowers" such as curiosity and creativity, and that graduation represents the potential realized through community care and opportunity.

Wellspring’s ELC operates as a trauma-informed, whole-family program for children ages one to five, offering individualized education and resources for parents. This wraparound approach fosters long-term stability, emotional resilience, and connection. While the graduates celebrated their achievements, the future of early learning programs like ELC faces challenges due to changing budget priorities that threaten essential services. The Early Childhood Education Assistance Program (Early ECEAP) has seen significant funding cuts, impacting support for families. However, strong community advocacy is crucial to ensuring that programs like Wellspring's continue to thrive, providing necessary resources for children and families to achieve their goals.
