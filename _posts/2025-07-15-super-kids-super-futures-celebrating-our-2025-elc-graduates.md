On June 27, Wellspring’s Community Room hosted a joyful graduation ceremony for 11 young learners from the Early Learning Center (ELC), themed "Superhero!" Graduates donned caps, gowns, and superhero masks, celebrating their journey in a program that provides early education alongside stability and support for families facing housing instability. Director Kelly Shepherd-Martin emphasized that each child possesses unique "superpowers" such as curiosity and creativity, and that graduation represents the potential realized through community care and opportunity.

Wellspring’s ELC operates as a trauma-informed, whole-family program for children ages one to five, offering individualized education and resources for parents. This wraparound approach fosters long-term stability, emotional resilience, and connection. While the graduates celebrated their achievements, the future of early learning programs like ELC faces challenges due to changing budget priorities that threaten essential services. The Early Childhood Education Assistance Program (Early ECEAP) has seen significant funding cuts, impacting support for families. However, strong community advocacy is crucial to ensuring that programs like Wellspring's continue to thrive, providing necessary resources for children and families to achieve their goals.
