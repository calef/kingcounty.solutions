  Dearest friends,

  Eid Mubarak! Thank you to each and every one of you who helped us surpass our Ramadan fundraising goal – with your generous support, we raised over $91,000 in 30 days. These funds will go directly back into the community.

  Ramadan is a time rooted in empathy and generosity. It’s a reminder that our blessings are not just meant to be cherished, but shared. This campaign is a reflection of this, and a reminder that even in difficult times, our community shows up for one another. By giving generously and locally to support Essentials First, you’ve helped uplift those most in need and reminded us what it truly means to care for one another.

  We look forward to another year of partnership in our mission to empower dignity daily, providing and advocating for essential hygiene access for all those who need it.

  In gratitude,

  Nicky Sheriff, CEO

  Essentials First
