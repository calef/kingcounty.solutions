The City of Bellevue has selected Bellwether Housing to develop affordable housing and community space on city-owned land in the Wilburton Transit-Oriented Development District. This decision follows a request for proposals that attracted ten submissions, with Bellwether chosen for its alignment with Bellevue's affordable housing and sustainability goals, including a target to create or preserve 5,700 affordable units over the next decade. The project will provide at least 127 affordable homes for families earning between 30% and 80% of the area median income and will incorporate sustainable, transit-oriented design features. Additionally, it will partner with a local youth services organization. The city is currently negotiating long-term leasing agreements and expects the project to be completed by 2030. The Wilburton area is envisioned as a vibrant mixed-use urban center, reflecting Bellevue’s commitment to sustainable growth and community engagement. Bellwether Housing, a nonprofit with 40 years of experience, serves approximately 5,000 residents in the Puget Sound region and focuses on developing affordable housing in transit-accessible neighborhoods.
