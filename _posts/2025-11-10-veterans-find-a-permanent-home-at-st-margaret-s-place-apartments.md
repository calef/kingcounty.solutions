This November marks the second anniversary of St. Margaret’s Place Apartments, a permanent affordable housing facility in Shoreline operated by Catholic Community Services (CCS). Among its 100 apartments, 20 units are designated for veterans. Residents Malcolm and Andrew, who moved in at the opening, share their journeys of overcoming homelessness. After facing significant life challenges, including relationship breakdowns and unstable housing situations, both found stability at St. Margaret’s. They have formed a close friendship, supporting each other through their transitions.

Despite progress in addressing veteran homelessness, many still struggle, with over 1,700 veterans in Washington experiencing homelessness nightly. CCS is dedicated to providing services and support to those who served, housing over 1,600 veterans in 2024 alone. St. Margaret’s offers a safe space that allows residents to regain independence and focus on personal growth. For Andrew, it has meant a renewed sense of autonomy, while Malcolm enjoys having the resources to pursue hobbies like art. Both express gratitude for their new homes, emphasizing how St. Margaret’s has transformed their lives by providing the stability and security they needed.
