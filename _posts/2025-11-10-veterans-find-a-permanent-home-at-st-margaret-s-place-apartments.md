  <p>This November, Catholic Community Services’ (CCS)&nbsp;St. Margaret’s&nbsp;Place&nbsp;Apartments celebrates two years since opening, and residents who&nbsp;moved in at opening are celebrating two years of permanent affordable housing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p>St. Margarets is a permanent affordable housing site&nbsp;in Shoreline&nbsp;operated&nbsp;by the CCS&nbsp;<a href="https://ccsww.org/our-services/coordinated-care-agency-king-county/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coordinated Care Agency</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;provides 100 apartments&nbsp;including a floor with 20 units&nbsp;designated&nbsp;for veterans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Malcom’s and Andrew’s Journeys to St. Margaret’s </strong> </h3>



  <p>Malcom first fell in love with the Pacific Northwest when he was stationed in Alaska and would often travel to Washington to support different missions. After his time in the military, Malcolm moved back to the Pacific Northwest with his family and, in 2012, became medically retired, relying on Social Security and Veterans benefits to support himself and his family. When Malcolm’s relationship ended, though, he had nowhere to go. He lived with a friend and then in his car before finding temporary housing for veterans, still searching for something more permanent.  </p>

  <p>Andrew shares a similar story. Originally from Western Washington,&nbsp;Andrew was stationed in&nbsp;Kansas and&nbsp;eventually found his way back home.&nbsp;He says his time after the military was characterized by “A lot&nbsp;of confusion and lot of ups and downs.”&nbsp;Andrew’s marriage ended and he navigated an uncertain housing situation&nbsp;until&nbsp;finding&nbsp;<a href="https://ccsww.org/services/michaels-place/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael’s Place</a>, a CCS program providing transitional housing for veterans.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Malcolm and Andrew were among the first residents to move into St. Margarets. Brought together by their similar experiences, the two have become close friends. “Andrew and I met here, and we clicked. I think&nbsp;we’re&nbsp;each other’s best friends here,” Malcolm says.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In November of 2023, St. Margaret’s opened in&nbsp;Shoreline after constriction was completed.&nbsp;The fifth floor of 20 units was&nbsp;designated&nbsp;for veterans, helping provide homes for veterans who would not otherwise be able to afford housing.&nbsp;The cohort of 20 veterans,&nbsp;including Malcolm and Andrew, moved in when St. Margaret’s&nbsp;first&nbsp;opened, achieving newfound stability and&nbsp;hope with a&nbsp;space to call their own.&nbsp;</p>



  <h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Starting a New Chapter with Veteran Housing</strong> </h3>



  <p>For Andrew, finding a home at St. Margarets has brought a renewed sense of independence.&nbsp;“I was tired of couch surfing and depending on other people. I have more independence here,” Andrew says.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Malcom shared that he no longer&nbsp;has to&nbsp;worry about where his next meal is coming from, where he would find a place to&nbsp;bathe, or where he would sleep at night.&nbsp;Instead,&nbsp;he gets to focus on his hobbies including spending time outdoors, fishing, and, with his new apartment, he&nbsp;now has&nbsp;space for&nbsp;3D printers&nbsp;that&nbsp;he&nbsp;enjoys creating art on. “It affords me the freedom to explore and do things that I want to do.”&nbsp;</p>

  <p>With the stability of permanent housing, Andrew and Malcolm expressed that&nbsp;they&nbsp;have&nbsp;more time and energy to devote&nbsp;to&nbsp;the things that matter most to them.&nbsp;“I’m grateful that I do have a roof over my head and that St. Margaret’s provided that roof,” Malcolm says.&nbsp;</p>

This November marks the second anniversary of St. Margaret’s Place Apartments, a permanent affordable housing facility in Shoreline operated by Catholic Community Services (CCS). Among its 100 apartments, 20 units are designated for veterans. Residents Malcolm and Andrew, who moved in at the opening, share their journeys of overcoming homelessness. After facing significant life challenges, including relationship breakdowns and unstable housing situations, both found stability at St. Margaret’s. They have formed a close friendship, supporting each other through their transitions.

Despite progress in addressing veteran homelessness, many still struggle, with over 1,700 veterans in Washington experiencing homelessness nightly. CCS is dedicated to providing services and support to those who served, housing over 1,600 veterans in 2024 alone. St. Margaret’s offers a safe space that allows residents to regain independence and focus on personal growth. For Andrew, it has meant a renewed sense of autonomy, while Malcolm enjoys having the resources to pursue hobbies like art. Both express gratitude for their new homes, emphasizing how St. Margaret’s has transformed their lives by providing the stability and security they needed.
