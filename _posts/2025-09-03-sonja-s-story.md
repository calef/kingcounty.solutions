Sonja Blomdahl, a glass artist from Seattle, faced an unexpected cancer diagnosis in June 2022 after years of routine mammograms. Diagnosed with lobular breast cancer, which often evades detection, she struggled with the emotional and physical challenges of treatment at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, located near her studio. Over a year of intensive treatment led her to make significant lifestyle changes, including quitting sugar, alcohol, and coffee.

After treatment, Sonja experienced lymphedema, requiring ongoing management. She found support through Cancer Lifeline, participating in nutrition and exercise classes, stress management workshops, and support groups. Her experience emphasized the importance of self-advocacy and vigilance in health screenings, as her cancer initially went undetected despite negative mammograms.

Currently, Sonja undergoes regular monitoring and reflects on her journey, recognizing that living with cancer involves ongoing challenges. While she no longer creates glass art, her work remains a symbol of resilience. Sonja advocates for listening to one’s body and seeking necessary care and connection, embodying courage and openness in her experience.
