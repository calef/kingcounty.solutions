Seattle police arrested a 31-year-old felon after he eluded officers in a stolen Ford F-150 on November 18, 2025. The vehicle was located using an Automatic License Plate Reader, prompting a pursuit aided by the King County Sheriff’s Guardian One helicopter. The driver recklessly fled through a residential area, and while the passenger escaped on foot, officers apprehended him shortly after. The helicopter continued to track the stolen truck until it stopped at a Goodwill parking lot in Ballard, where the driver changed clothes in an attempt to evade capture.

Officers arrived at the store and arrested the driver with the assistance of store security. During the arrest, they discovered 25.9 grams of fentanyl and drug paraphernalia, as well as burglary and auto theft tools inside the stolen vehicle. The suspect, a multi-convicted felon under active supervision for robbery, was booked into King County Jail on charges including possession of a stolen vehicle, eluding police, and possession with intent to distribute narcotics.
