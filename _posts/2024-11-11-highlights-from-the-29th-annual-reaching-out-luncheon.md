  Annual Reaching Out Luncheon was a heartfelt celebration of storytelling, centering
  on the value of everyone’s own unique story, as well as the healing and learning
  that comes from sharing our stories. The compelling narratives shared during the
  event emphasized the vital role of Hopelink’s mission to combat poverty in our region,
  highlighting how the support of our community sustains this work.&nbsp;\n\n“Hopelink’s
  Reaching Out Luncheon is one of my favorite days of the year,” said Meghan Altimore,
  Hopelink’s Interim CEO. “This year, the combination of powerful stories and education
  about the trauma of navigating life in poverty – and having the opportunity to connect
  with so many community members who are deeply connected to Hopelink’s mission –
  made for a perfect day!”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nStaff members of Hopelink’s [Transportation](https://www.hopelink.org/programs/transportation/)
  and [Food Assistance](https://www.hopelink.org/programs/food-program/) programs
  shared the profound impact the agency’s services have had on the lives of many,
  including their own.&nbsp;\n\nNEMT Contracts Manager Victor Londoño Quintero shared
  how [English for Work](https://www.hopelink.org/programs/adult-education/english-for-work/)
  helped him settle into his new community after migrating from Colombia, eventually
  accepting a role in Hopelink’s Transportation call center. Seven years later, Victor
  is now pursuing a graduate degree in nonprofit administration. He introduced a video
  of fellow Hopelink [Adult Education](https://www.hopelink.org/programs/adult-education/)
  graduate Maricela.&nbsp;\n\n“Maricela may have participated in another Adult Education
  program, but our journeys aren’t that different. Like so many Hopelink graduates,
  we share a resiliency and determination that propels us towards a life where we
  can set down roots and uplift our communities,” he said.&nbsp;\n\nA budding author,
  the [video](https://youtu.be/KxrigEujpIc) opened with Maricela flipping through
  the pages of her book’s manuscript before recounting how she achieved her high school
  diploma.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n“Everybody falls sometimes, and we all need a hand to help
  pick us back up, and Hopelink is a mighty hand,” she said.&nbsp;\n\n![Hopelink’s

  speaker Stephanie Land, author of _Maid: Hard Work, Low Pay, and a Mother’s Will
  to Survive_, took the stage to recount her experience navigating poverty in Washington
  State as a single mother.&nbsp;\n\n“Since _Maid_ was published, I have received
  thousands of messages from people who heard my story and felt a little less alone,”
  Stephanie said. “As human beings, we are all a part of a much bigger story. But
  we must see each other, pay attention, and listen to each other. By listening to
  and sharing other’s stories, we will evoke empathy and inspire compassion.”&nbsp;\n\nShe
  continued, “Our dignity as humans does not reside in our success, our dignity is
  being alive and caring for each other, recognizing that we are all equals who all
  deserve the same opportunities while realizing that many will not have the same
  chances towards success.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nLike Stephanie, Hopelink believes that
  by acknowledging the inherent value in every individual, we can continue to support
  one another in meaningful ways. We saw this demonstrated by the many attendees who
  showed up to support Hopelink at the Luncheon.&nbsp;\n\n![Immediately following

  a Reaching Out Luncheon Table Captain for many years, and everyone was very impressed
  with Stephanie Land’s speech,” said Sarah Stone, Hopelink Table Captain at this
  year’s Luncheon. “It was great discussing and reacting to what Stephanie Land said,
  and it provided us with a lot to reflect on, and how to turn those reflections into
  action.”&nbsp;\n\nIf you’re inspired to contribute or were unable to attend, please
