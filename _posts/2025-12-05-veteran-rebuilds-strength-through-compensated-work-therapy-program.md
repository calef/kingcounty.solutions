  ## Rebuilding strength through meaningful work

  If you visit the [George E. Wahlen VA Medical Center](https://news.va.gov/?s=George+E.+Wahlen+VA+Medical+Center) on any given morning, you might spot Navy Veteran Rick Silver crisscrossing campus, checking tire pressure on a government vehicle before heading into a building to ensure fire extinguishers are up to code.

  It’s a routine that keeps him moving and engaged, but his life didn’t always have this busy rhythm.

  An electrical engineer by trade, Silver had to step away from the career he loved after a heart attack changed everything.

  “My mother and my doctor both told me I shouldn’t work anymore because I had a lot of damage to my heart, and if I had another heart attack, I would certainly die,” Silver said.

  At first, his former employer allowed him to continue working part-time. But when the company asked him to return to a full-time schedule, he faced a hard decision.

  “The job I had was actually very stressful,” he recalled. “I was still afraid of working the way I used to, so I quit.”

  Over the next 12 years, Silver became sedentary, and even light activity left him winded. As his heart condition worsened to the point where he needed a transplant, he felt like every day was the same.

  “Being in the condo and not really having anything that I needed to do except for doctors’ appointments was depressing,” he said. “It was making it harder for me to get up every day.”

  That’s when his care team at VA Salt Lake City suggested he consider the [Compensated Work Therapy (CWT) program](https://www.va.gov/health/cwt/), an initiative that helps Veterans build endurance, skills and confidence to rejoin the workforce.

The Compensated Work Therapy (CWT) program offers veterans an opportunity to rebuild their strength and skills through meaningful work experiences. This program is part of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and is designed to help veterans who are facing challenges in their transition to civilian life. CWT provides support for those with mental health issues, disabilities, or other barriers to employment. Participants engage in various work settings, gaining valuable skills that enhance their employability and confidence.

Veterans involved in the program report improved mental health and a renewed sense of purpose. CWT is tailored to meet individual needs, allowing participants to work at their own pace while receiving guidance from trained professionals. The program also fosters social connections, reducing feelings of isolation among veterans.

Through CWT, veterans can explore various career paths, receive vocational training, and prepare for competitive employment. The program emphasizes the importance of work in recovery and rehabilitation, supporting veterans in achieving their personal and professional goals. By participating in CWT, veterans not only contribute to their communities but also gain the tools necessary for long-term success in the workforce.
