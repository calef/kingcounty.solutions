  ## Teens and AI Companionship: What the Research Shows

  A new study highlighted in the article reveals that more than half of surveyed teens report using AI companions. Many find comfort in these digital interactions, describing them as supportive or even as meaningful as conversations with friends. For some, AI companions provide a safe space to talk about feelings, practice social skills, or find relief from loneliness.

  However, mental health experts raise important cautions. While AI tools may offer short-term comfort, they can also blur boundaries, create emotional dependency, and potentially displace opportunities for real human connection. Unlike trusted friends, family members, or trained counselors, AI lacks the depth, accountability, and genuine empathy that young people need to thrive.

  ## YES’s Perspective

  In the article, Noble and Debbie provide a perspective rooted in their daily work with youth and families. They stress that while AI can be a tool, it should never replace authentic relationships or professional therapeutic support.

More than half of surveyed teens are using AI companions, finding them supportive and meaningful, akin to interactions with friends. These digital tools provide a safe space for discussing feelings and alleviating loneliness. However, mental health experts caution against reliance on AI, noting that it can blur emotional boundaries and foster dependency, detracting from real human relationships. AI lacks the depth and empathy necessary for healthy development, which trusted friends and trained counselors can provide. YES Co-Occurring Disorders Therapist Noble and Agency-Based Director Debbie emphasize that while AI can serve as a tool, it should not replace authentic relationships or professional support. They advocate for the importance of real connections in fostering resilience and healing among youth. As this trend continues to grow, YES is committed to promoting safe and supportive environments where young people can establish meaningful connections with peers and trusted adults who comprehend their challenges.
