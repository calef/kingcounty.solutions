Friends of Youth participated in Bothell Pride and the Pride Celebration at Kirkland Urban, reinforcing their commitment to the LGBTQ2IA+ community. Many young individuals they support identify as LGBTQ2IA+, and these events allow them to show visibility and create a sense of belonging within the community. This year's Pride celebration is particularly significant due to an increase in policies across the U.S. that adversely affect LGBTQ2IA+ youth, restricting their access to essential resources and support. Throughout the month, Friends of Youth is actively fundraising to support LGBTQ2IA+ youth facing homelessness. They emphasize that it is not too late to contribute, as Pride month continues. Every donation serves as a message to young people that they are seen, cared for, and supported.
