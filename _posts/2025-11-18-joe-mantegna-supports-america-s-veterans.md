Nick Koulchar, an Army veteran, has inspired many, including actor Joe Mantegna, through his remarkable journey of resilience after losing both legs to an IED explosion in Iraq in 2008. Koulchar, who joined the Army in 2006, has since completed over 20 marathons and various CrossFit competitions, proving that he can overcome physical challenges. As a benefits advocate for Disabled American Veterans, he assists fellow veterans in obtaining their earned benefits, highlighting the organization's vital support in providing stability and purpose to injured veterans.

Mantegna, known for his roles in "Criminal Minds" and "The Godfather Part III," has been an ardent supporter of DAV, emphasizing the sacrifices of servicemen and women and the ongoing struggles many face upon returning home. He encourages public support for DAV, stating that the organization plays a crucial role in assisting veterans in need. Mantegna invites Americans to contribute $19 a month to help ensure that no veteran is left behind, reinforcing the message of gratitude and support for those who have served the nation.
