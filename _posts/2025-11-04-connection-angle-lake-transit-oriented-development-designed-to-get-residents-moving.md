  Connection Angle Lake is a new multifamily property for families and individuals in SeaTac. The new property is creating more housing close to transit and for residents with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD).

  Developed by Mercy Housing Northwest, it has 130 units for tenants earning up to 30%, 50% and 60% of area median income. Of those, 26 units are reserved for residents who have IDD and families with dependent children. Connection Angle Lake opened with a celebration Sept. 10.

  Connection Angle Lake, like [several other projects supported by Commerce](https://deptofcommerce.app.box.com/s/pjnkkcyl8wgu0frlcp5e3gcj4kaqwq9u'), was funded as a transit-oriented development (TOD) to increase the density of affordable housing near transit hubs. It is blocks away from Sound Transit’s Angle Lake station, which has light rail and bus service. As a result, more low-income people and people with disabilities can access affordable housing and low-barrier transportation to employment, education, health care, and more.

  Mercy Housing Northwest President Joe Thompson said the property will have an important impact on the community.

  “Connection Angle Lake marks our sixth Transit Oriented Designed project with Sound Transit. Centering homes around walkable and reliable transportation is important, but for those in the IDD community it is vital. This community provides greater mobility. It means the entire region is at the doorstep of the residents who live here,” he said.

  Connection Angle Lake also serves as the new headquarters for [The Arc of King County](https://arcofkingcounty.org/)’s Arc Legacy Center. The Arc of King County provides referrals for the 26 IDD units onsite. This creates an intentionally inclusive community. Mercy Housing provides onsite property management to all residents, with dedicated services to tenants with IDD.

  Mercy Housing funded this project to serve people with disabilities in response to a lack of accessible housing in south King County. SeaTac has limited accessible housing, with 87% of its housing stock constructed before the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, [according to City of SeaTac Comprehensive Plan](https://www.seatacwa.gov/government/comprehensive-plan).

  Connection Angle Lake received funding from a variety of sources, including the Washington State Housing Trust Fund, King County, and [Amazon’s Housing Equity Fund](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/community/amazon-housing-equity-fund).
