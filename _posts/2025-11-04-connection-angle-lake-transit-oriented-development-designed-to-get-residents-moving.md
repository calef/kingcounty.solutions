Connection Angle Lake, a newly developed transit-oriented multifamily property in SeaTac, Washington, is designed to increase accessible housing near transit hubs. The project was developed by Mercy Housing Northwest and features 130 units for tenants earning up to 60% of the area median income. Of these, 26 units are reserved for residents with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) and families with dependent children. The property also serves as the headquarters for The Arc of King County's Arc Legacy Center, creating an intentionally inclusive community. The project received funding from sources including the Washington State Housing Trust Fund, King County, and Amazon’s Housing Equity Fund.
