The Washington State Department of Health has launched the Measles Exposure Location Tracker, an online tool providing real-time updates on measles exposure sites across the state. This initiative aims to inform the public of potential exposure, especially following a recent case at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. With 11 confirmed measles cases in 2025, the tool consolidates information from local health departments, promoting vaccination and preventive measures. The site is mobile-friendly, allowing easy access to exposure information and supporting outbreak response efforts. Dr. Tao Sheng Kwan-Gett emphasizes the importance of vaccination for community safety.
