  FEPP Levy'

The upcoming November ballot in Seattle includes Proposition 1, which seeks to renew the Family, Education, Preschool, and Promise (FEPP) Levy for seven years. This $1.3 billion investment aims to support early learning initiatives, including the Seattle Preschool Program (SPP) that benefits over 3,000 children from low-income families through subsidized education. The FEPP Levy funds various programs, such as child care subsidies and staff retention payments, with over half allocated to early learning. If approved, the SPP will continue to provide an accredited, evidence-based curriculum designed to prepare children for kindergarten, while also equipping child care providers with specialized coaching. Failure to renew the levy would result in the dissolution of the SPP, depriving thousands of children of access to quality early education. Community members, elected officials, and organizations like BrightSpark Early Learning Services urge residents to participate in discussions about the levy and vote. As election day approaches, voters are encouraged to check their registration status and ensure they are prepared to cast their ballots.
