The Federal Way Link Extension project is advancing, with significant milestones achieved recently. The Sound Transit Board has approved the final design and budget, allowing construction to commence. This extension will add approximately 7.8 miles of light rail from the Angle Lake Station in SeaTac to Federal Way. The project is designed to improve transit accessibility and connectivity in the region.

Key features of the extension include three new stations: South 272nd Street, Star Lake, and Federal Way Transit Center. The extension is expected to accommodate more than 10,000 daily riders once operational, offering a reliable alternative to car travel and helping to reduce traffic congestion. The estimated completion date is set for 2024, with the total cost projected to be around $300 million.

Sound Transit emphasizes the importance of community engagement throughout the planning and construction phases, ensuring that local residents are informed and involved. The project aligns with broader regional goals to enhance public transportation options and promote sustainable development. Overall, the Federal Way Link Extension marks a significant investment in the area's transit infrastructure, supporting the growing population and enhancing economic opportunities.
