  <p>In her new role, Mireli is excited to support Bellevue families in ways that genuinely make a difference and help them feel supported and cared for.</p>



  <p>“To me, community means lifting each other up,” shared Mireli. “It means looking out for one another and making sure no one is left behind.”</p>

  <p><strong>Why is Bellevue LifeSpring’s mission meaningful to you?</strong><br>Growing up, I faced some of the same challenges and barriers that many families in our area experience today. I was incredibly fortunate to have support and resources, like those offered by Bellevue LifeSpring. These resources helped me succeed in school and chase my dreams. That’s why this mission means so much to me—it’s personal and close to home.</p>



  <p><strong>What do you hope to achieve in your new role?</strong><br>I’m so excited to give back to the community that raised me and help support local families in meaningful ways that make a difference.</p>
