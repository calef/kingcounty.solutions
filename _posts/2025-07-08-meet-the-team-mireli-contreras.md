Join us in welcoming Mireli as the new Family Support Administrator for Bellevue LifeSpring. A native of Bellevue, Mireli is dedicated to ensuring that local children and families have access to essential support and resources. She holds a bachelor’s degree in social work from the University of Washington and is motivated by her own experiences growing up, where she faced challenges similar to those many families encounter today. Mireli emphasizes the importance of community, stating, “To me, community means lifting each other up.” Her personal connection to Bellevue LifeSpring’s mission drives her commitment to giving back to the community that nurtured her. In her role, she hopes to make a meaningful impact on local families. Outside of work, Mireli enjoys thrifting, exploring new foods, and staying active outdoors with her dog. We are thrilled to have Mireli on board and look forward to the positive changes she will bring to the Bellevue community.
