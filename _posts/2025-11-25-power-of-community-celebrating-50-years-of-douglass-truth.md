A celebration marking 50 years of the Douglass-Truth Branch library will take place on December 13, from noon to 5 p.m., inviting the Seattle community to honor its history. Originally opened in 1914 as the Henry L. Yesler Memorial Library, the branch was renamed in 1975 following a community vote to honor abolitionists Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth. This renaming reflected the branch’s commitment to serving the predominantly African American population of the Central District. The event will feature live jazz, history tours, and presentations about the library's African-American Collection, which has evolved into one of the West Coast's largest collections of African American literature and history. This collection began with a donation from the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.®, Delta Upsilon Omega Chapter in 1965. Speakers at the event will emphasize the library's role as a community hub and a testament to civic engagement. The celebration is organized in partnership with local community organizations and sponsored by donors of The Seattle Public Library Foundation. Attendees will also have opportunities to envision the next 50 years for the branch.
