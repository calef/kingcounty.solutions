  <h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What’s in a name? About the Douglass-Truth Branch</strong></h3>



  <p>When it opened on September 15, 1914, the Seattle Public Library branch at 23<sup>rd</sup> Avenue and E. Yesler Way was named the Henry L. Yesler Memorial Library to recognize Yesler’s early efforts to start a library in Seattle.</p>



  <p>Seattle’s Central Area experienced many demographic transitions <a href="https://www.spl.org/hours-and-locations/douglass-truth-branch/douglass-truth-branch-highlights">in its first decades</a>. By the 1960s, the majority of the branch’s users were African American, but the Library was slow to adapt to the changing community. Leaders of AKA-DUO – including Dr. Millie Russell, Roberta Byrd Barr, and Ruth Marie Brown &#8212; partnered with branch librarian James Welsh to increase the branch’s relevance to the community, including launching the African American Collection in 1965.</p>



  <p>Dr. Russell also worked with the Black Friends of the Yesler Library, AKA-DUO and other community groups to gather support for renaming the branch. In 1974, a <a href="https://cdm16118.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p16118coll42/id/293/rec/30">ballot</a> was distributed to neighborhood residents, listing 10 names of notable African Americans. Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth tied for first place.</p>

A celebration marking 50 years of the Douglass-Truth Branch library will take place on December 13, from noon to 5 p.m., inviting the Seattle community to honor its history. Originally opened in 1914 as the Henry L. Yesler Memorial Library, the branch was renamed in 1975 following a community vote to honor abolitionists Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth. This renaming reflected the branch’s commitment to serving the predominantly African American population of the Central District. The event will feature live jazz, history tours, and presentations about the library's African-American Collection, which has evolved into one of the West Coast's largest collections of African American literature and history. This collection began with a donation from the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.®, Delta Upsilon Omega Chapter in 1965. Speakers at the event will emphasize the library's role as a community hub and a testament to civic engagement. The celebration is organized in partnership with local community organizations and sponsored by donors of The Seattle Public Library Foundation. Attendees will also have opportunities to envision the next 50 years for the branch.
