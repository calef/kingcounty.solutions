Last week, a coalition of organizations urged the Seattle City Council to allocate $10 million for tenant-based rental assistance in the 2026 city budget. This funding aims to support low-income tenants living in non-profit housing financed by the Office of Housing (OH), assisting those struggling with rent arrears and helping to prevent evictions and homelessness. The rising cost of living has put significant financial strain on these tenants, forcing them to choose between paying rent and meeting basic needs like food and medical care. The proposed $10 million is specifically designated for residents in OH-funded housing, addressing the urgent need for financial support. Advocates have encouraged community members to express their support to the City Council via email, highlighting the importance of this funding in fostering a just and livable Seattle. A list of supporters from various organizations reinforces the coalition's commitment to this cause.
