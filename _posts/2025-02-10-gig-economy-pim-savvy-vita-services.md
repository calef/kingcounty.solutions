If you earn income from gig work, such as driving for deliveries or renting out property, you must file a tax return if your net earnings from self-employment exceed $400. PIM Savvy's Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program offers free tax preparation services for eligible individuals. Gig work includes tasks facilitated through digital platforms like Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, and Amazon. Workers in this sector may receive various tax forms, including 1099-NEC, 1099-K, or W-2.

To qualify for VITA's free tax services, you must meet specific criteria: you should be self-employed without employees, have more revenue than expenses, not claim home office deductions, maintain documentation of income and expenses, track business mileage if relevant, and plan to file your personal and business taxes together. Your income must also be under $79,000.

For the 2025 tax season, PIM Savvy VITA will provide both virtual and in-person tax prep appointments across several locations. Interested individuals can schedule appointments by calling or texting PIM Savvy. Additionally, eligible clients may receive assistance with the Working Families Tax Credit application.
