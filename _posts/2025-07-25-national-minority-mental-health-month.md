July is National Minority Mental Health Month, highlighting the unique mental health challenges faced by communities of color, particularly regarding serious illnesses like cancer. For many patients of color, the cancer experience is not solely a medical issue but also a mental health crisis influenced by systemic inequities and mistrust in the healthcare system. Supportive cancer care, which includes pain management, counseling, and decision-making assistance, is essential for addressing the emotional and practical challenges of cancer. However, patients of color often face barriers to accessing these critical services. Personal accounts reveal systemic issues, such as racial bias in care that can exacerbate psychological distress. To combat these inequities, it is vital to enhance access to supportive care, particularly in underserved communities, and to ensure that care teams reflect the diversity of the populations they serve. The integration of supportive services should begin early in the treatment process, making them a fundamental aspect of care. All stakeholders, including patients, healthcare providers, and policymakers, must advocate for equitable access to supportive care, ensuring that every individual receives comprehensive support throughout their cancer journey.
