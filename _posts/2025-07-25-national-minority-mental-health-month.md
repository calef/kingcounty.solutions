  acknowledge and address the unique mental health challenges faced by communities
  of color. While much of the conversation rightly focuses on access to therapy and
  overcoming stigmas related to seeking help, one critical area that is often overlooked
  is the emotional toll of serious illness — especially cancer. For many patients
  of color, the cancer journey is not just a medical crisis; it’s a mental health
  emergency shaped by longstanding inequities, medical mistrust, and unequal access
  to care.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Supportive cancer care can be a powerful tool for
  both psychological and physical healing. Supportive care helps patients and caregivers
  address the unique and multifaceted challenges that come with a life-altering diagnosis,
  from emotional distress to financial stressors. It includes services like pain and
  symptom management, counseling, and help with decision-making. Yet too often, patients
  of color are left out of these services or encounter barriers that delay or deny
  their access. As we reflect on mental health this month, we must also confront how
  cancer care systems can either deepen trauma or become a source of healing.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>As
  a Black woman who is supporting a national coalition on supportive care and a lifelong
  health advocate who founded a philanthropic foundation, each of us has seen how
  communities of color are expected to carry the weight of illness with quiet strength.
  Black patients are often praised for being resilient, but resilience shouldn’t mean
  suffering in silence or without support. The emotional toll of cancer doesn’t end
  at the diagnosis. It extends into the long waiting rooms, the overwhelming paperwork,
  and the sense that you’re navigating it all alone.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>For example,
  in a 2024 study, Black cancer survivors described how racism shaped their care in
  ways that left lasting psychological scars. One patient in the study recalled being
  ignored in a waiting room while white patients were seen first. Another recounted
  how an emergency room doctor “did not give credence to what I was telling her, she
  did not listen and take me seriously. [I…] had all the classic symptoms of colorectal
  cancer and she ignored them all.” These aren’t isolated incidents. They’re part
  of a broader pattern that erodes trust and discourages Black patients – and those
  from other racial communities – from seeking the very care that could ease their
  suffering.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Supportive cancer care, on the other hand, can
  be a lifeline, offering patients and their caregivers relief from pain, anxiety,
  and fear. As one patient in another study shared, “I had a meltdown [and] I finally
  emailed my oncologist and I said I don’t know what I need. But I need something
  and it’s not in my head … And she immediately referred me to somebody and I started
  talking to someone on the phone.” But as the word “finally” in this patient’s testimony
  shows, too often supportive care comes late in treatment or not at all for patients
  of color.<br /> </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>To begin addressing these inequities, we
  must expand access to supportive cancer care in every community — especially those
  historically underserved. We need to invest in culturally responsive and racially
  equitable care teams who understand and reflect the communities they serve. We must
  integrate supportive services early in the cancer journey, not as an afterthought,
  but as a standard part of treatment from day one. And we must ensure that every
  patient — regardless of their background or zip code — has access to the emotional,
  physical, and practical support they need to navigate cancer with dignity. Policymakers,
  health systems, and insurers all have a role to play in making this care the standard,
  not the exception.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>But change doesn’t only come from the top.
  If you or someone you love is facing cancer, ask your doctor about supportive care.
  It’s not just for end-of-life — it’s for anyone who wants to live better while facing
  a serious illness. And if you’re a provider, advocate, or policymaker, ask yourself:
  Are we doing enough to make this care available early, equitably, and compassionately
  — especially to communities that have long been excluded?</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>This
  National Minority Mental Health Month, let’s take action:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<ul
  class=\"wp-block-list\">\r\n<li>Patients and families: Ask about supportive care
  early. You don’t have to wait until things get worse to get help.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Health
  systems and clinicians: Make culturally responsive supportive care a standard, not
  a privilege.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Policymakers and insurers: Fund it, integrate
  it, and hold systems accountable for equitable access.</li>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>All
  of us: Speak up, share stories, and push for care that heals the whole person —
  not just the disease.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Healing the body means caring
  for the mind — and every patient and caregiver deserves both.<em>Sheri Biller is

July is National Minority Mental Health Month, highlighting the unique mental health challenges faced by communities of color, particularly regarding serious illnesses like cancer. For many patients of color, the cancer experience is not solely a medical issue but also a mental health crisis influenced by systemic inequities and mistrust in the healthcare system. Supportive cancer care, which includes pain management, counseling, and decision-making assistance, is essential for addressing the emotional and practical challenges of cancer. However, patients of color often face barriers to accessing these critical services. Personal accounts reveal systemic issues, such as racial bias in care that can exacerbate psychological distress. To combat these inequities, it is vital to enhance access to supportive care, particularly in underserved communities, and to ensure that care teams reflect the diversity of the populations they serve. The integration of supportive services should begin early in the treatment process, making them a fundamental aspect of care. All stakeholders, including patients, healthcare providers, and policymakers, must advocate for equitable access to supportive care, ensuring that every individual receives comprehensive support throughout their cancer journey.
