Mayor Bruce Harrell has officially ended the Limited Civil Emergency declared on October 30 due to uncertainties surrounding Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) funding amidst a federal government shutdown. The emergency measures included $3 million in emergency food assistance to support Seattle residents affected by delays in SNAP payments. Over three weeks, the city allocated $1 million weekly to community agencies, aiding more than 50,000 households relying on SNAP for food.

During the emergency, food banks and meal programs saw significant increases in demand, with some locations experiencing a 21% rise in customers. A partnership with Seattle Public Schools resulted in the distribution of 8,800 food boxes to families at 98 school sites. The boxes contained essential food items, demonstrating the strength of Seattle's food network.

Looking forward, Mayor Harrell's proposed 2026 budget includes nearly $12 million to enhance food access, expand local food banks, and support the Fresh Bucks program. On Thanksgiving, the city will provide free hot meals at City Hall, further supporting those in need. Local organizations praised the city's swift response to the crisis, highlighting the collaborative efforts to ensure food security for vulnerable families.
