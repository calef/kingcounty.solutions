The Seattle Office of Labor Standards (OLS) has reached a settlement with Handy Technologies, an online platform providing home services, over violations of the Domestic Workers Ordinance. The OLS alleged that Handy failed to comply with the city's labor laws, impacting domestic workers' rights. As part of the settlement, Handy has agreed to pay $250,000, which will be distributed to affected workers. Additionally, Handy will make operational changes to ensure compliance with the ordinance moving forward, including providing better protections for domestic workers. This settlement marks a significant step toward enforcing labor rights in the gig economy, emphasizing the importance of fair treatment for all workers.
