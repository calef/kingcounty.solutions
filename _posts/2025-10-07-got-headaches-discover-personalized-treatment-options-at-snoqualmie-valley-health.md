  While many headaches are short-lived, for some people they can become frequent, severe, and disruptive to daily life. In fact, headaches are the number one reason patients seek neurological care—highlighting just how common and impactful they are. The most frequent types are primary headache syndromes, such as migraine and tension-type headaches. Less common but equally important to recognize are the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, a group of rare but extremely painful disorders that include cluster headaches. By contrast, secondary headaches arise from another medical issue or injury and require careful evaluation to identify the underlying cause.

  ### **Diagnosing Headaches with Care and Precision**

  Diagnosing headaches involves much more than describing the pain. Neurologists take a detailed medical history, perform a thorough physical and neurological examination, and, when appropriate, order advanced neuroimaging such as CT or MRI scans to rule out more serious conditions. This thoughtful, step-by-step process ensures that patients receive both an accurate diagnosis and the most effective treatment plan for their specific type of headache.

  ### **Comprehensive and Personalized Treatment Options**

  Medication management plays a key role in headache treatment, but it must be approached carefully. While over-the-counter pain relievers can offer short-term relief, overuse can actually worsen headaches, leading to medication overuse (rebound) headache. For this reason, neurologists often focus on a combination of preventive treatments—to reduce how often headaches occur—and abortive treatments, which stop headaches quickly once they start.

  Treatment options may include prescription medications, natural supplements, and FDA-approved noninvasive devices that calm brain activity.

  For patients with chronic or particularly stubborn headaches, additional treatments can often be provided right in the clinic, without the need for outside referrals. These include Botox injections, occipital nerve blocks, and management of temporomandibular joint (TMJ)–related headaches. Such in-office procedures can offer meaningful relief for patients whose headaches do not respond well to traditional medication.
