Snoqualmie Valley Health offers personalized treatment options for patients suffering from headaches, which are the main reason patients seek neurological care. Most common are primary headache syndromes like migraines and tension-type headaches, while others stem from other medical issues or injuries. Diagnosis involves a detailed medical history, physical examination, and potentially advanced neuroimaging. Treatment involves a combination of preventive and abortive treatments, possibly including prescription medications, natural supplements, and FDA-approved noninvasive devices that calm brain activity. Additional treatments, such as Botox injections or management of TMJ-related headaches, can be provided in-house. Dr. Jimmy Young, MD, provides comprehensive evaluation and treatment.
