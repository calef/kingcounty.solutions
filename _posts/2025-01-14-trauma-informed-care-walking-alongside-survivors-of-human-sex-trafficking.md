For over 50 years, Olive Crest has been a leader in child abuse prevention and family restoration, emphasizing trauma-informed care for survivors of human sex trafficking. These survivors often face complex trauma, distrust in relationships, and mental health challenges such as PTSD, anxiety, and depression. Trauma-informed care is a compassionate, evidence-based approach that focuses on safety, healing, and empowerment through five core principles: safety, trustworthiness, peer support, collaboration, and cultural humility.

Olive Crest provides secure, trauma-sensitive housing options, such as the Hope Refuge program, along with individualized support services tailored to each survivor's unique needs. This includes therapeutic counseling and life skills training. The staff at Olive Crest is specially trained in trauma-informed practices to engage survivors respectfully.

Community connection is fostered through mentorship and peer support groups, helping survivors rebuild trust. Olive Crest also advocates for awareness of human trafficking, offering workshops to educate families and caregivers on recognizing warning signs. A success story includes "Emma," who escaped trafficking, received support from Olive Crest, and is now pursuing a degree in social work to help others. Olive Crest celebrates the resilience and potential of survivors, emphasizing their journey towards healing and independence.
