Asian Counseling and Referral Service (ACRS), established in 1973, focuses on providing culturally responsive mental health care for Asian and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (A&NH/PI) communities in the Pacific Northwest. United Way of King County was instrumental in this mission, providing ACRS with its first grant to support mental health services. ACRS is dedicated to addressing the needs of BIPOC, immigrant, and refugee communities, working against systemic oppression and promoting social justice.

Among its various programs, ACRS launched the Children, Youth, and Families (CYF) program in 1993, which offers a range of support services. Notably, the Queer Opportunities to Lead Organize and Reflect (QOLOR) program, established in 2023, serves Queer and Trans BIPOC youth at Aki Kurose Middle School. This program addresses significant mental health challenges faced by these youth, providing them with a safe space to build community and learn essential life skills.

Through partnerships with organizations like United Way, ACRS has successfully implemented programs that empower youth, including the newly initiated Lotus Circle for Asian girls, showcasing the importance of community support in addressing mental health needs.
