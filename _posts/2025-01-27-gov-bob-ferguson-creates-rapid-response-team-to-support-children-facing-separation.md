  Body\n\n_Executive Order brings agencies, schools together to support kids separated
  from parents or caregivers_\n\n**OLYMPIA** – Gov. Bob Ferguson created a rapid response
  team today aimed at reducing harms caused by President Donald Trump’s immigration
  enforcement policies which, if implemented, will destabilize families and harm children
  who are separated from their deported or detained parents or primary caregivers.\n\nMass
  deportation was a centerpiece of Trump’s campaign. His [campaign website](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/platform)
  lists “Carry out the largest deportation operation in American history” as second
  on his list of priorities. Several Day 1 executive orders involved immigration,
  including [“removing promptly all aliens who enter or remain in violation of federal
  law,”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/securing-our-borders/)
  and calling for [“the total and efficient enforcement” of “immigration laws against
  all inadmissible and removable aliens.”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/protecting-the-american-people-against-invasion/)
  Trump has directed the Department of Homeland Security to [expand its use of \"expedited
  removal,\"](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2025-01/25_0123_er-and-parole-guidance.pdf)
  which allows immigration officers to deport some people without a hearing.&nbsp;On
  Jan. 23, his [press secretary announced](https://x.com/PressSec/status/1882614534609027221)
  “The largest massive deportation operation in history is well underway.”\n\nAt an
  event hosted by OneAmerica at El Centro de la Raza, Ferguson signed [Executive Order
  25-04](https://governor.wa.gov/sites/default/files/exe_order/EO%2025-04.pdf) directing
  the immediate creation of a Family Separation Rapid Response Team in the Department
  of Children, Youth, and Families (DCYF). The team will recommended policies and
  actions for addressing family separation and the lasting effects on children.\n\nIf
  implemented, mass deportation policies will significantly harm kids with undocumented
  parents. These children are often American citizens.\n\nThe team will include professionals
  within DCYF, Washington State Patrol, the Office of Refugee and Immigrant Assistance,
  the Attorney General’s Office and representatives of the Governor’s Office. Members
  of the team will consult with regional and local experts on immigration and child
  welfare. Additionally, they will develop policies aimed at supporting children who
  experience family separation through the deportation or detention of their parents
  or caregivers.\n\n“My administration will do everything possible to address the
  harms caused by a mass deportation and detention program,” Ferguson said. “That
  includes making sure kids who are torn away from their parents have someone to care
  for them and uninterrupted access to their education.”\n\nFerguson ordered the rapid
  response team to hold its first meeting by Feb. 14. The team will:\n\n- Review agency
  policies and procedures to identify any changes that can assist in responding to
  the separation of families. This includes situations where a large number of children
  in the same geographic area may be separated from their parents or caregivers at
  the same time. \n\n- Identify policies or procedures that may help support children
  of deported or detained parents and lessen, to the extent possible, the lasting
  impacts resulting from such separation, in consultation with immigration and child
  welfare experts.\n\n- Meet with the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction
  (OSPI) and local school districts to develop strategies for mitigating disruption
  to the education and development of children whose parents are deported or detained.\n\n-
  Create proactive lines of communication between DCYF, OSPI and local school districts
  to permit quick and responsive action when prompt cooperation is needed to support
  the child, including if a child’s parents are taken for deportation or detention
  while the child is at school.  \n &nbsp;\n- Work with state universities, colleges,
  community colleges and Running Start to ensure and support robust pathways to higher
  education for children who experience the trauma of having their parents or primary
  caregivers deported or detained.\n\nThe Family Separation Rapid Response Team will
  be in regular contact with the Governor’s Office to share its findings and recommendations
  as work progresses."
