This week, we published one important post highlighting the urgent need for legal assistance in family law within King County. As many residents face challenges navigating family law issues, the Eastside Legal Assistance Program (ELAP) is actively seeking pro bono attorneys to help meet this critical demand.

### Legal Aid Demand in Family Law
The Eastside Legal Assistance Program (ELAP) has reported a significant increase in the demand for family law attorneys, particularly in its virtual family law clinics. In their recent post, [High need for family law attorneys](https://elap.org/high-need-for-family-law-attorneys/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=high-need-for-family-law-attorneys), ELAP outlines the pressing need for pro bono volunteers who can dedicate just 1-3 hours per month. This initiative aims to provide free legal aid to individuals in King County who cannot afford representation. ELAP offers comprehensive onboarding and ongoing support for volunteers, making it easier for attorneys to contribute meaningfully to their community.

By volunteering, attorneys can play a vital role in assisting those who are navigating complex family law matters, ensuring that everyone has access to the legal support they need. Interested attorneys are encouraged to sign up through the ELAP website to make a difference in the lives of their neighbors.
