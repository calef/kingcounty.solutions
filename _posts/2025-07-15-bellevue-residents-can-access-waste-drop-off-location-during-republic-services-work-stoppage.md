Bellevue residents impacted by the ongoing labor dispute with Republic Services can utilize a temporary waste drop-off location. Republic Services is offering free drop-off services on specific dates this week. The locations and times are as follows: Odle Middle School at 502 143rd Ave NE on Saturday, July 19 from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. and Thursday, July 17 from 8 a.m. to 2:30 p.m.; and Bannerwood Park parking lot at 1790 Richards Rd on Tuesday, July 15 from 9:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. and Wednesday, July 16 from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. The drop-off will accept bagged garbage, recycling, and compost materials, with Republic Services staff available to assist. If the labor dispute continues, the City of Bellevue will work with Republic Services to establish additional drop-off locations. Utilities Director Lucy Liu expressed appreciation for this temporary solution and emphasized the commitment to minimizing impacts on residents during this period. The City of Bellevue has a contract with Republic Services for waste management services, including garbage, recycling, composting, and yard waste.
