  <p>For Matt and Mary-Pat Beattie, supporting YES is deeply personal. Their connection to YES began years ago when their son Jack, 13 at the time, was referred by his school for early substance use counseling. What started as a one-time visit became a lasting relationship with the organization that offered Jack and his entire family a safe place through his <span style="color: #ff6600;"><a style="color: #ff6600;" href="https://www.youtheastsideservices.org/services/substance-use-treatment/">journey with substance use</a></span> and mental health challenges.</p>
  <blockquote><p>“YES was always the one place Jack actually liked going,” Matt recalls. “He trusted his counselor. He even made friends there. That’s a big deal.”</p></blockquote>
  <p>Jack’s story, like too many others, was not an easy one. After years of receiving services at YES, Jack was diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 19. He continued to work hard to stay on a path toward recovery, attending multiple treatment programs and continuing to meet with his YES counselor. But in 2016, at age 20, Jack tragically passed away from an accidental overdose. His death came at a time when fentanyl-related fatalities were on the rise, and support systems were not always able to keep up with the rapidly changing risks.</p>
  <p>Yet through their grief, the Beatties chose a path of purpose.</p>
  <p>Mary-Pat, who works at Microsoft, has been a passionate advocate for YES within the company’s <span style="color: #ff6600;"><a style="color: #ff6600;" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/philanthropies/employee-engagement">Give program</a></span>. She’s not only made YES a recurring recipient of her donations, matched 100% by Microsoft, but has also organized creative and heartfelt campaigns to raise awareness and support. One standout was a Halloween-themed horror movie vote-a-thon, where colleagues donated to push their favorite film to the top of the list. The winning film, The Lost Boys, brought together over 100 attendees and raised significant support for YES.</p>
  <p>Despite the emotional weight of their story, the Beatties continue to speak out, to fight stigma, advocate for more effective mental health systems and substance use counseling, and keep Jack’s spirit alive through their giving.</p>
  <blockquote><p>“We keep donating because YES made a hard time better,” says Mary-Pat. “For Jack, it was a positive place where he felt supported. That mattered.” Matt adds, “You have hope when you see people who care keep trying. And YES keeps trying.”</p></blockquote>
  <p>The Beatties continued generosity is a testament to love, to memory, and to the belief that every young person deserves the chance to heal and thrive. YES is honored to be part of Jack’s story and grateful to the Beatties for helping make recovery possible for others.</p>

Matt and Mary-Pat Beattie have a personal connection to Youth Eastside Services (YES), stemming from their son Jack's journey with substance use and mental health challenges. Initially referred for counseling at 13, Jack developed a trusting relationship with his counselor and found a supportive community at YES. After being diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 19, he continued to seek help but tragically passed away from an accidental overdose at 20, amid rising fentanyl-related fatalities.

In the wake of their loss, the Beatties chose to honor Jack's memory by advocating for YES and supporting mental health initiatives. Mary-Pat, an employee at Microsoft, has made YES a key beneficiary of her donations, which are matched by the company. She has organized fundraising events, such as a Halloween-themed movie vote-a-thon that successfully raised funds and awareness for YES.

Despite their grief, the Beatties remain committed to fighting stigma and improving mental health systems. Their ongoing generosity reflects their belief that every young person deserves a chance to heal, and they encourage others to support YES through donations, highlighting the impact these contributions make on youth and families in need.
