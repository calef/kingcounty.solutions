The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has released the FY2025 Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) for homelessness Continuums of Care (CoC). The King County Regional Homelessness Authority (KCRHA), which leads the Seattle-King County CoC, applies for these funds on behalf of the entire CoC in King County. Typically, the CoC receives $67 million to support programs such as Permanent Supportive Housing, Rapid Re-Housing, and Transitional Housing. However, new policies and priorities in the NOFO are expected to create a funding gap of up to $40 million compared to the current allocation. Additional provisions in the NOFO may further jeopardize funding. KCRHA intends to collaborate with partners to leverage this opportunity to strengthen programs and systems while ensuring stability in shelter and housing investments for the most vulnerable community members.
