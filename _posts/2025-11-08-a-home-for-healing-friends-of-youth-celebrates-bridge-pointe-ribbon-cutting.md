Friends of Youth has opened Bridge Pointe Housing, a supportive residence for young adults aged 18-24 transitioning from inpatient treatment. The Ribbon Cutting Ceremony took place on November 4, 2025, attended by notable speakers including Friends of Youth leadership, local government representatives, and advocates for youth services. Located in Kirkland, Bridge Pointe provides up to 90 days of stable housing along with comprehensive support services aimed at aiding recovery and fostering independence. Participants receive on-site mental health therapy, substance use recovery support, medication coordination, peer-led groups, and life skills coaching. Staff assist residents in accessing education, employment, and long-term housing resources. This initiative is part of a statewide effort funded by Senate Bill 1929, which aims to create transitional “bridge care” housing for youth exiting behavioral health facilities. Jim Theofelis, Founder of NorthStar Advocates, emphasized the importance of stable housing and support immediately following inpatient treatment to help young people reintegrate into their communities. For further inquiries, interested parties can contact Bridge Pointe directly for eligibility and bed availability.
