Isaiah McCoy, a 37-year-old man from Honolulu, Hawaii, was sentenced to life in prison for sex trafficking three adult women and one minor. A jury found him guilty of multiple charges, including sex trafficking, obstructing an investigation, and racketeering-related offenses. The court also ordered McCoy to pay over $1 million in restitution to the victims. 

During the trial, evidence revealed that McCoy exploited the vulnerabilities of his victims, using manipulation, physical violence, and psychological coercion to force them into commercial sex acts from 2019 to 2021. He falsely promised love and financial security, but his true intent was to profit from their suffering. McCoy enforced strict control over the victims, subjecting them to severe physical abuse if they did not meet his demands or broke his rules. His violent actions created an environment of fear, leaving victims feeling trapped and isolated.

Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and the Honolulu Police Department conducted the investigation, highlighting the commitment to combat human trafficking. The case underscores the Justice Department's dedication to holding offenders accountable and seeking justice for survivors of such crimes.
