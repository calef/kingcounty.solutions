The Bellevue City Council has given preliminary approval to a 20-year transportation plan, which includes projects from the Downtown Transportation Plan Update, Transit Master Plan, and Mobility Implementation Plan. This plan, part of the draft 2026-2045 Transportation Facilities Plan, will replace the current 2022-2033 plan. The council has instructed the Transportation Commission and staff to extend the plan's timeframe and conduct a State Environmental Policy Act review.

Additionally, the council launched neighborhood planning efforts in Eastgate and Factoria as part of the “Great Neighborhoods” initiative. This process aims to gather community input to shape local development and improvement projects. A kickoff event will be held on September 4 at the South Bellevue Community Center.

Charles Mcintyre has been appointed to the Arts Commission, serving a term that expires on May 31, 2027. The council also issued proclamations for Black Business Month to honor Black-owned businesses and for International Overdose Awareness Day to promote awareness and prevention efforts. The next council meeting is scheduled for September 9.
