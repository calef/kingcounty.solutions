Every May, Older Americans Month celebrates the contributions of older adults and addresses the challenges they face. This year's theme, “Flip the Script,” encourages a reevaluation of the stereotypes and outdated narratives surrounding aging. A significant aspect of ageism manifests in everyday language, where seemingly innocuous phrases can perpetuate negative perceptions. For example, the phrase “You look great… for your age!” implies that aging is a disadvantage. A more respectful alternative is simply to say, “You look great!” Similarly, expressions like “Having a senior moment” reinforce stereotypes about forgetfulness among older adults. Instead, one could say, “I’m having a forgetful moment,” emphasizing that forgetfulness is a universal human experience.

Other common phrases, such as “They’re too old to change,” suggest rigidity in older adults, while the reality is that people of all ages can learn and adapt. By changing how we refer to older individuals, such as recognizing their contributions and independence, we foster a more inclusive narrative. The article encourages intentional language use to uplift and empower older adults, urging readers to notice and rephrase ageist language and engage in conversations about age inclusion.
