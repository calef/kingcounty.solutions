  ## What to Know About SNAP Benefits & the Government Shutdown

  ![On October 17, Washington’s DSHS alerted Hopelink and social service organizations around the state that they will be unable to administer SNAP food benefits starting on November 1 if they do not receive federal funding, as the federal government remains shut down since October 1.  ](https://www.hopelink.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shutterstock_2390843059-1024x683.jpg "What to Know About SNAP Benefits & the Government Shutdown 1")

  ### What you should know

  In our busy world, we know how overwhelming it can be to keep up with the news.&nbsp;We&nbsp;wouldn’t&nbsp;blame you if you&nbsp;came across a headline&nbsp;recently&nbsp;about changes to SNAP&nbsp;benefits but&nbsp;still&nbsp;aren’t&nbsp;quite sure&nbsp;what these&nbsp;changes mean or even what SNAP stands for.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  To&nbsp;start, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program – formerly known as food stamps – is a federal program that provides&nbsp;food&nbsp;purchasing&nbsp;assistance&nbsp;to&nbsp;low-income families and individuals.&nbsp;An estimated&nbsp;41.7 million people&nbsp;nationwide&nbsp;depend on the program,&nbsp;using Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) cards&nbsp;that are replenished each month,&nbsp;with an average amount of $187 per participant,&nbsp;to&nbsp;purchase&nbsp;food and meet basic nutritional needs, according to the US Department of Agriculture.&nbsp;

  The program is&nbsp;directly linked&nbsp;to improving&nbsp;long-term&nbsp;health outcomes,&nbsp;reducing the overall prevalence of food insecurity by 30%.&nbsp;Low-income&nbsp;adults enrolled in the program incur an estimated 25%&nbsp;less&nbsp;in medical costs per year&nbsp;than those not enrolled,&nbsp;according to a 2022 report by the Center on Budget & Policy Priorities.&nbsp;

  The Washington Department of&nbsp;Social&nbsp;& Human Services&nbsp;(DSHS)&nbsp;oversees the state’s&nbsp;SNAP&nbsp;program, Basic Food,&nbsp;using federal funds appropriated by Congress&nbsp;each year&nbsp;to provide food&nbsp;purchasing&nbsp;assistance&nbsp;for&nbsp;Washington residents&nbsp;enrolled in the program.&nbsp;According to Washington’s DSHS,&nbsp;nearly 1&nbsp;million Washingtonians depend on SNAP benefits to feed themselves and their families.&nbsp;

  On October 17, Washington’s DSHS alerted Hopelink and social service organizations around the state that they&nbsp;will be unable to administer&nbsp;SNAP food benefits&nbsp;starting on November 1 if they do not receive federal funding, as the federal government&nbsp;remains&nbsp;shut&nbsp;down since October&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  ### What this could mean for SNAP recipients

  **For our community members who use EBT cards to pay for their groceries, those cards will not be replenished with their&nbsp;designated&nbsp;monthly amount&nbsp;come&nbsp;November 1,&nbsp;if&nbsp;the federal government&nbsp;remains&nbsp;closed.&nbsp;** The&nbsp;benefits&nbsp;won’t&nbsp;be&nbsp;allocated&nbsp;until the federal government reopens.&nbsp;

  Public Health – Seattle & King County&nbsp;estimated&nbsp;nearly 118,000&nbsp;King County&nbsp;residents&nbsp;received SNAP benefits in 2023.&nbsp;Hopelink predicts that&nbsp;as distribution of SNAP benefits is disrupted, we&nbsp;will&nbsp;see a&nbsp;significant&nbsp;increase in visitors to the five no-cost Hopelink Food Markets and Mobile Market&nbsp;as&nbsp;community members&nbsp;work to fill the gap created by the absence of SNAP benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  The fact is that thousands of households in our region are already struggling. Our&nbsp;[2025 Community Needs Assessment](https://www.hopelink.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Hopelink-2025-Community-Needs-Assessment-Report.pdf)&nbsp;shows us that&nbsp;over 135,000 people in North and East King County –&nbsp; **roughly&nbsp;one&nbsp;in every&nbsp;five&nbsp;people –&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;have enough money to meet their basic needs.** &nbsp;These households are already having to make&nbsp;incredibly&nbsp;difficult decisions&nbsp;every single day about what essential needs&nbsp;they should meet first with the finite resources they have available.&nbsp;The gap created by this disruption in SNAP funds&nbsp;will be&nbsp;devastating for these community members,&nbsp;making these decisions&nbsp;even&nbsp;harder.&nbsp;

  This can look like people&nbsp;using&nbsp;funds&nbsp;they&nbsp;currently&nbsp;use to pay for prescriptions, housing costs, utility bills, childcare, or other&nbsp;necessities to&nbsp;pay for food. In this situation, we&nbsp;sometimes&nbsp;see parents&nbsp;forgoing&nbsp;sufficient food themselves so their children can eat.&nbsp;Falling&nbsp;behind on&nbsp;these essentials can quickly add up and compromise someone’s&nbsp;health and financial&nbsp;stability,&nbsp;often&nbsp;leading to a cascading&nbsp;financial crisis.&nbsp;

  This is why Hopelink is preparing for increased&nbsp;needs&nbsp;across&nbsp;all of&nbsp;our program areas,&nbsp;including Food,&nbsp;Financial Assistance and Energy Assistance.&nbsp;

  As shown in our&nbsp;[2025 Impact & Annual Report](https://chrome-extension//efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.hopelink.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Hopelink_2025-Impact-Annual-Report.pdf),&nbsp;we’ve&nbsp;seen needs rise significantly over the past year. In fact, we recorded a 24% increase in visits to Hopelink Food Markets in the 2025 fiscal year and marked our highest ever-recorded number of people enrolled in the Food Assistance program. For every person we were able to issue flexible financial&nbsp;assistance, there&nbsp;were another 15 people who also called and needed our&nbsp;help.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  Due to these compounding hardships, Hopelink will be offering&nbsp;additional&nbsp;food to all shoppers during visits to our food markets.&nbsp;

Due to the ongoing government shutdown, the Washington Department of Social & Human Services (DSHS) has alerted social service organizations such as Hopelink that they will be unable to administer SNAP food benefits starting November 1, without federal funding. This may affect nearly 1 million Washingtonians and 41.7 million people nationwide who depend on SNAP. Hopelink anticipates increased visits to its food markets as a result. The organization is preparing to offer additional food to all shoppers and encourages community support through monetary contributions, food donations, and volunteering.
