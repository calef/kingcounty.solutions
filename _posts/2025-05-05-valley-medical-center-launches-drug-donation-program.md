To reduce medication waste and support patients in need, Valley Medical Center is launching a drug donation program on May 8, 2025. This initiative aims to repurpose unused prescription medications, as surveys indicate that two-thirds of such drugs in U.S. households remain unutilized. Patients can donate sealed, unexpired prescription medications, which will be reviewed for eligibility and redistributed at no cost to Valley patients requiring temporary supplies.

Donations will be accepted during regular business hours at two locations: Prescription Pad Pharmacy North and Prescription Pad Pharmacy South in Renton, Washington. Accepted items include sealed, unused medication bottles, individually packaged medications, creams, ointments, and inhalers, all with at least six months until expiration. However, the program does not accept injectable medications, medications in amber vials, controlled substances, eye drops, or over-the-counter medications.

Items that cannot be accepted can still be disposed of safely using medication take-back kiosks available at both pharmacy locations. Valley patients seeking donated medications should contact their healthcare provider directly for assistance.
