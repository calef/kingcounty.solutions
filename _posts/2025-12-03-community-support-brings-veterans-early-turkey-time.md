Veterans at the VA Medical Center in West Los Angeles received an early Thanksgiving celebration, thanks to community support. The event featured a traditional turkey meal served with all the trimmings and was organized by the local nonprofit organization Team Rubicon. Volunteers from Team Rubicon, many of whom are veterans themselves, worked to create a festive atmosphere complete with decorations and live music. The gathering provided veterans with an opportunity to connect with one another and enjoy a sense of camaraderie.

In addition to the meal, veterans were able to participate in various activities and receive information about available services. The event aimed to uplift spirits and foster a sense of community among those who have served in the military. Attendees expressed their gratitude for the support and the chance to engage with fellow veterans. Team Rubicon’s involvement highlights the importance of community in supporting veterans and ensuring they feel appreciated and connected during the holiday season. This early Thanksgiving celebration exemplifies the positive impact of collaborative efforts to honor and assist those who have served the nation.
