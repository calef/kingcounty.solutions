The Seattle Preschool Program (SPP) is celebrating its 10th anniversary, having prepared over 11,421 children for kindergarten since its inception in 2015. Initially launched with 15 classrooms and 280 seats under the 2014 Seattle Preschool Levy, SPP has expanded to 156 classrooms and over 2,500 children this school year, thanks to funding from the 2018 Families, Education, Preschool, and Promise (FEPP) Levy. Mayor Bruce Harrell highlighted the program's impact on the educational readiness of Seattle's children, with plans to further expand SPP by adding 600 seats by 2032, pending voter approval in the Fall 2025 ballot. A recent evaluation shows SPP participants outperforming peers in kindergarten readiness and later academic achievement. The program has received recognition for its quality, including gold medals from CityHealth and the National Institute for Early Education Research. The 2024 data indicates that 83% of SPP participants met developmental expectations, with 48% from low-income households. Families report high satisfaction with the program, and SPP continues to offer tuition assistance to advance educational equity. Enrollment for the 2025-26 school year is currently open, and the program aims to provide high-quality preschool education to all children, regardless of their background.
