Seattle has launched a partnership between the Department of Education and Early Learning (DEEL) and Talkspace to enhance mental health support for local teens and young adults. This initiative provides free online therapy to over 55,000 residents aged 13 to 24, addressing the urgent need for accessible mental health care. Participants can access confidential services through Talkspace’s secure platform, including unlimited messaging therapy and one live video session per month, alongside 24/7 access to Talkspace Go, a self-guided mental health program.

The partnership is part of a $14.55 million investment by Seattle Public Schools and the City of Seattle aimed at strengthening mental health resources for students. Mayor Bruce Harrell emphasized the importance of expanding telehealth options to improve mental health outcomes for youth, who are facing unprecedented challenges. DEEL Director Dr. Dwane Chappelle reiterated the goal of ensuring young people have access to the necessary support for their wellbeing. The partnership with Talkspace aims to remove barriers to therapy and provide culturally competent care. Additional telehealth providers will be announced soon, further expanding resources for Seattle's youth.
