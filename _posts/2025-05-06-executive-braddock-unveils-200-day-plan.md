  **Story**

  Today, after the final King County Council confirmation naming her executive, Executive Braddock [unveiled a 200-Day Plan](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/swdn5dbhfmx6joljeoav2/200-Day-Agenda.pdf?rlkey=uijl3fezlzvdjq7iogirejbjp&st=sw6mq0l1&dl=0) to guide her administration — a focused and forward-looking agenda that outlines a comprehensive approach to positioning the county for continued success while fostering lasting progress.

  **Regional Readiness, Responsible Budgeting, and Resisting Federal&nbsp;Attacks**

  As Executive Braddock begins her term, she is focused on developing a values-driven and balanced budget, taking action to defend against harmful federal rollbacks, and strengthening the county’s emergency readiness to safeguard residents during uncertain times.

  _Pass a Responsible, Values-Driven Budget_

  - Build a balanced budget that protects core services and ensures safe, vibrant, and healthy communities. This includes securing new revenue to protect key priorities, identifying efficiencies, and reinvesting in effective programs that serve those who need it&nbsp;most.

  _Defend King County from Unlawful Federal&nbsp;Actions_

  - Coordinate with local governments to assess and address impacts of federal rollbacks and continue legal challenges to resist unlawful federal&nbsp;actions.

  _Prepare for Emergencies and Disruptions_

  - Create contingency plans for disruptions to FEMA and federal aid while establishing an emergency preparedness fund and bolstering reserves. King County will also consider the backfill of select regional disaster funding to ensure mitigation planning, wildfire, and extreme heat readiness across the&nbsp;county.

  **Prioritize Children, Working Families, and Vulnerable Populations**

  This plan also prioritizes key initiatives that deliver direct impact to King County residents. From securing vital levies and behavioral health funding to expanding access to transportation and reimagining youth justice, Executive Braddock’s focus is on practical, community-centered solutions that build a stronger, more equitable county.

  _Champion Key&nbsp;Levies_

  - Ensure the successful implementation of two essential levies — the Parks Levy and Medic One/EMA Levy — which if approved by voters, will help support families, communities, and public&nbsp;safety.

  _Transmit a MIDD&nbsp;Renewal_

  - Transmit the next iteration of the behavioral health sales tax to ensure critical services for kids and adults throughout King&nbsp;County.

  _Expand Rural and Accessible Transit_

  - Partner with Metro to pilot van service for rural, elderly, disabled, and low-income residents needing in-person services.

  _Advance a Renewed Focus on Care for Youth&nbsp;Justice_

  - Expand community-informed alternatives to the youth justice system, focusing on healing, accountability, and long-term safety. This work will establish a care-first framework that centers families, aligns with public safety, and ensures strong oversight.

  **Embrace Best-Run Government Principles Focused on Who We&nbsp;Serve**

  As part of her commitment to long-term planning and equitable governance, Executive Braddock is launching key initiatives that lay the foundation for future success in public safety, essential services, and technology. These efforts will bring together regional partners, community voices, and county leadership to shape policies that reflect shared values and prepare King County for the challenges ahead.

  _Convene a Public Safety Roundtable_

  - Assemble members of the council and departmental leaders from law enforcement, public health, and our justice system to align on smart, equitable safety strategies to be recommended as part of the 2026–27&nbsp;budget.

  _Host a Regional Utilities Affordability Summit_

  - Convene a multi-jurisdictional summit in partnership with local municipal leaders to develop coordinated strategies that address affordability and ensure access to essential utilities — including water, sewer, and energy — for all King County residents.

  _Advance King County AI&nbsp;Policy_

  - Launch the development of a new artificial intelligence policy that supports privacy, prevents bias, protects workers, and promotes responsible innovation across county departments.

  **Transition to New Leadership and Set the Stage for the&nbsp;Future**

  As the November election approaches and King County prepares for a leadership transition, Executive Braddock is committed to ensuring a smooth and effective handover while reinforcing the county’s long-term vision for the future. This plan emphasizes the transfer of institutional knowledge, operational stability, and the continued integration of core values, all while upholding the public trust. The transition will prioritize continuity, accountability, and good governance, laying a strong foundation for the next chapter of King County’s&nbsp;success.

  _Facilitate Institutional Knowledge Transfer_

  - Spearhead a smooth transition by developing and organizing briefing materials, transition memos, and programs to support continuity for incoming leadership.

  _Bolster Operational Stability_

  - Champion strong internal management across departments, empower leadership teams, and create clear decision-making pathways to ensure King County navigates the transition period with efficiency and cohesion.

  _Cement Our Long-Term Vision_

  - Embed established long-term strategies that ensure we continue working toward our True North to make King County a welcoming community where every person can&nbsp;thrive.

  _Uphold the Public&nbsp;Trust_

  - Model good governance and collaboration, with a renewed focus on who we serve throughout the transition process, reinforcing public confidence in the county’s ability to serve regardless of political change.
