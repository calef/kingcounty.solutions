King County Executive Shannon Braddock has introduced an ambitious 200-Day Plan aimed at effectively guiding her administration. This plan focuses on delivering results for residents, preparing a responsible and balanced budget, and ensuring a smooth transition to the next administration. Key priorities include developing a values-driven budget that protects essential services and enhancing emergency preparedness. Braddock seeks to defend King County against harmful federal actions, while also prioritizing initiatives that directly benefit children, working families, and vulnerable populations.

The plan outlines strategies for implementing vital levies for community support and advancing behavioral health services. It emphasizes fostering regional collaboration, addressing utility affordability, and launching an artificial intelligence policy focused on privacy and responsible innovation. As the November election approaches, Braddock is committed to facilitating a smooth leadership handover, ensuring operational stability, and reinforcing the county's long-term vision for success. The overarching goal is to uphold public trust and create a welcoming community where all residents can thrive. This comprehensive approach positions King County for continued progress and resilience amid challenges.
