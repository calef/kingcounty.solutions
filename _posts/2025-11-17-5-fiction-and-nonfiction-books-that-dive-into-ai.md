---

Five notable books explore the implications of artificial intelligence, both in fiction and nonfiction. "Empire of AI" by Karen Hao provides an insider's look into the development of commercial AI, drawing from her experiences with OpenAI. It examines how AI influences lives globally and offers insights on consumer roles in shaping its future. Reid Hoffman’s "Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right With our AI Future?" encourages optimism, likening AI's emergence to transformative inventions like the automobile and the internet.

In fiction, Adrian Tchaikovsky's "Service Model" humorously critiques a future where a robot valet, Uncharles, navigates a chaotic bureaucracy in a sparsely populated world. Conversely, Annalee Newitz’s "Automatic Noodle" presents a heartwarming tale of robots in a post-flood California, exploring their newfound autonomy. Bruce Holsinger’s "Culpability" tackles the darker side of AI through a psychological thriller about a family affected by a self-driving car accident, raising ethical questions about technology's role in society. Collectively, these works highlight the urgent need to consider the ethical dimensions of AI as it becomes an integral part of everyday life.
