  June is a month to reflect and to celebrate. It’s Pride Month – a time to honor the resilience, joy, and rights of LGBTQIA+ communities. And on June 19th, we recognize Juneteenth, the day that marks the end of slavery in the United States. Both moments invite us to recommit to justice, equity, and inclusion.

  At The Sophia Way, our values of being welcoming, supportive, and compassionate are at the heart of everything we do. The women we serve are on a journey out of homelessness, often carrying the weight of generational injustice. More than 54% of our clients are women of color, and 38% identify as Black. Black women are far more likely to face housing instability – and with a social safety net that continues to fray (fewer affordable homes, fewer living-wage jobs, and less access to health care), the barriers only grow.

  We meet each woman with compassion, using a trauma-informed approach to understand her full story and her unique needs. One request we hear often in our shelters is for hair products specifically for Black hair. Last year, we asked the community for these much-needed items on Juneteenth. The response was heartwarming.

  This year, we’re expanding that effort with a Black hair care drive throughout the month of June, in partnership with five organizations. We know that for Black women, hair care isn’t just about beauty, it’s about identity, confidence, and cultural pride.

  Serving women with dignity means seeing them fully and responding with respect and resources.

  This month, and every day, we celebrate the strength and resilience of the women we walk alongside. We’re grateful for their trust and for your support in giving them shelter, safety, and stability.

The Sophia Way, an organization assisting women out of homelessness, is expanding its efforts to support Black women facing housing instability. With over half of their clients being women of color, they are now focusing on the unique needs of Black women. One request often heard in their shelters is for hair products specifically for Black hair. In response, The Sophia Way is hosting a Black Hair Care Drive throughout June, in partnership with five organizations. The aim is not only to meet practical needs but also to honor the identity, confidence, and cultural pride associated with Black women's hair care.
