The Justice Department has announced significant actions to combat illicit revenue generation by the North Korean government, resulting in five guilty pleas and civil forfeiture actions totaling over $15 million. U.S. nationals and a Ukrainian identity broker were involved in schemes helping North Korean actors secure remote IT jobs with U.S. companies using false identities, impacting 136 companies and generating more than $2.2 million for the DPRK. Additionally, a North Korean hacking group, APT38, executed multimillion-dollar virtual currency heists from foreign platforms in 2023, prompting the U.S. to seize over $15 million in stolen virtual currency for forfeiture. The initiative is part of the DPRK RevGen: Domestic Enabler Initiative aimed at disrupting North Korea's illegal financial activities and enforcing U.S. sanctions. The FBI continues to investigate these schemes, emphasizing the importance of private sector vigilance against such threats. The Department's commitment to national and economic security underscores the need to prevent hostile nations from financing illicit programs through fraudulent activities targeting U.S. businesses and citizens.
