Launch Learning is excited to announce the opening of a new afterschool program at Wing Luke Elementary School in early 2025. This program will operate from school dismissal until 6:00 p.m. and aims to provide students with nutritious snacks, academic support, outdoor play, and engaging enrichment activities. Additionally, full-day care will be available during school breaks and in-service days from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., potentially at a different location.

Families interested in the program can begin the registration process online, and existing Procare account holders have a separate link for registration. A required Tuition Agreement Form must also be signed. Once the registration and supplemental forms are completed, families will receive a confirmation or waitlist email for their child. Parents can download their child's immunization form from myIRmobile.com and email it to the program. For any questions or support, families can reach out via email to enrollment@launchlearning.org.
