  and they''ll look out for each other as well. It promotes that community work. They
  call each other and say ''hey, they have this today.''<strong>&nbsp;We provide a
  space for clients to create that community for themselves as well</strong>.</p><p
  class=""><strong>We do our part, and they do their part</strong> <strong>to support
  each other</strong>. You can see the dedication our guests have to get here early,
  to go out of their way for things. Sometimes it takes multiple buses to get here,
  to carry stuff with them. It takes a lot of dedication and work from them. It''s
  the same from the staff perspective. Having to move heavy things around multiple
  times. Getting here early. Having the conversation. Helping people park their cars
  when it''s difficult to find parking. We go above and beyond to do it.”</p></blockquote><p
  class="">Community care has always been deeply rooted in our organization’s history,
  first founded in a basement by a group of concerned neighbors who didn’t want to
  see members of their community go hungry; we exist and persist because of community
  care. While some folks may stop in seeking services like a bag of groceries, others
  come simply for the connection — the genuine desire to be a part of something. If
  you''ve stopped by the food bank, you know that feeling. It''s that thing that keeps
  you showing up, that leads you to buy&nbsp;<strong>a bottle of oil to donate, take
  a long lunch break to drive a home delivery route, or encourages you to make a gift&nbsp;because
  we all feel it — we''re stronger and better off in a&nbsp;community. </strong></p>'

Over the past year and a half, the Rainier Valley Food Bank has undergone significant transformation during its building renovation, driven by community care. The organization has adapted its services by creating a Food Village and collaborating with local partners to host Mobile Markets. A notable aspect is the home delivery program, which serves 750 families weekly, facilitated by dedicated drivers covering 40 routes and more than 10,000 miles annually. Volunteers play a crucial role, fostering relationships with clients to better understand their needs. Outreach Coordinator Viri highlights the mutual support among clients, who not only seek assistance but also help one another, creating a sense of community. The food bank's history is rooted in community care, initiated by neighbors committed to preventing hunger. While many visit for food, others seek connection, reinforcing the idea that community involvement enhances resilience. This collaborative spirit inspires actions like donating and volunteering, illustrating the belief that together, the community is stronger and more capable of overcoming challenges.
