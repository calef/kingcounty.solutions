On September 19, 2025, Mary’s Place and Mercy Housing Northwest broke ground on a transformative campus in Burien, designed to provide emergency family shelter alongside permanently affordable housing. This initiative aims to address family homelessness through a model that combines immediate shelter, long-term housing options, and supportive services, all informed by community input. The project will feature a shelter capable of housing up to 200 individuals each night, with private rooms and access to on-site services including health care, education, and community-building programs. Recreational facilities will include a mini soccer pitch and a basketball half-court, fostering a supportive community environment.

In addition to the shelter, the campus will include 90 affordable apartments for families earning at or below 60% of the area median income, with 30 units designated for very low-income families transitioning from homelessness. The groundbreaking event highlighted the urgent need for such facilities, as many families are currently unable to access shelter due to limited capacity in King County. Completion of this innovative campus is anticipated by mid-2027, offering a pathway from crisis to stability for families in need.
