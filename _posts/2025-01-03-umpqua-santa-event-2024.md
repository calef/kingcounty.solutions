Umpqua Bank’s South Lake Union Branch hosted the Umpqua Santa Event 2024, transforming the branch into a festive winter wonderland for Launch families. This year marked the third annual celebration, featuring activities such as crafts, games, gingerbread house decorating, and cookie decorating. Families enjoyed “snowballs” and had the opportunity to take photos with Santa, who also engaged children with delightful storytime in the snow. The evening fostered a sense of community and joy, with many families participating in the celebrations. A heartfelt thanks was extended to the staff at Umpqua – South Lake Union for their efforts in creating a memorable experience for everyone involved.
