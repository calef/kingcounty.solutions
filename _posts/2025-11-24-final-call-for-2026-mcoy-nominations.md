Just one week remains to submit nominations for the 2026 Military Child of the Year® Award, hosted by Operation Homefront. The deadline for nominations is 11:59 p.m. CST on Monday, December 2. This prestigious award honors seven military children who exemplify resilience and strength in the face of military life challenges. The recipients, representing each branch of the U.S. Armed Forces, will be recognized for their academic excellence, community involvement, and leadership.

Awardees will attend a gala in Washington, D.C. on April 23, 2026, where they will each receive $10,000, a laptop, and additional surprises from Operation Homefront’s partners. In the previous year, the awardees experienced a combined 34 duty station changes and contributed over 3,488 volunteer hours. Nominations can be made by anyone, including family members, friends, teachers, and coaches. Operation Homefront aims to support military families by improving their well-being, providing financial assistance, housing, and other support services.
