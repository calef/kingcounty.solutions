People often remain silent about abuse due to various reasons, not solely fear or shame, but sometimes out of love and the desire to protect their family. Alexandra Jayne recounts her experience of being sexually abused by her biological father from a young age, believing it was normal until education about abuse opened her eyes. Despite the pain, she chose not to tell her family, fearing it would devastate them and disrupt their lives. Years later, a friend's encouragement prompted her to share her story, leading to a pivotal moment when she finally revealed the truth to her brother. This journey highlights that survivors of abuse may not always exhibit visible signs of their trauma, and their resilience is shaped by their experiences. Alexandra reflects on the importance of choosing kindness, honesty, and integrity in the face of adversity and emphasizes that love and joy should not be hidden away but shared, as they multiply through giving. Her narrative is a testament to the complexities of survival and the transformative power of sharing one's truth, illustrating that healing is a personal and unique journey for every survivor.
