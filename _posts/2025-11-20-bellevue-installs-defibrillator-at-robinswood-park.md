A new automated external defibrillator (AED) will be installed at Robinswood Park in Bellevue, a popular outdoor sports venue. The official unveiling is set for November 22, with representatives from Project 100, Medic One, and city officials present. The installation aims to enhance the safety of park visitors, especially in emergencies where rapid defibrillation can significantly increase survival rates from sudden cardiac arrest. Medical professionals from Medic One Foundation will provide training on hands-only CPR and AED usage at the park from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Project 100, a coalition focused on placing AEDs at sports fields across Washington, emphasizes the importance of quick access to these devices, as survival rates decrease by 10% with each passing minute without intervention. The AED will be located near the restrooms by the 22nd Street playfields, and the city will ensure it is maintained and accessible 24/7. Bellevue plans to install two additional AEDs at Downtown Park in the upcoming summer, reinforcing their commitment to public safety in recreational areas.
