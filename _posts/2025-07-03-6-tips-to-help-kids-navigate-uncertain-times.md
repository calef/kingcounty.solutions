  As the school year comes to a close and summer vacation begins, many families experience a significant shift in their daily routines. While the prospect of summer freedom is exciting, it can also bring intense challenges that might impact young children’s emotional and physical well-being. The changes in structure, combined with heightened community stress, can trigger responses in our nervous systems that often lead to anxiety, irritability, or mood fluctuations.

  Community stressors, like ongoing social or political tensions and the abrupt shift from a structured school day to a less predictable summer schedule, can overwhelm kids’ nervous systems. When the brain senses uncertainty or disruption in routine, it can activate the fight or flight response, making it harder for anyone to regulate their emotions. Kids, and even adults, might act out, become withdrawn, or show signs of stress in unexpected ways.

  Instead of responding to these behaviors with punitive measures, it’s important for parents and caregivers to focus on soothing the nervous system. Connection-based strategies are a gentle way to support children through this transition, helping them feel safe and secure despite the changes around them. Here are six connection-focused tips for parents and caregivers to try when things are difficult:

  1. **Create Predictable Routines**

  Children thrive on consistency, and the sudden lack of school schedules can create uncertainty. Set simple, predictable routines for daily activities like mealtimes, playtime, and bedtime. Knowing what to expect can help children feel more secure and reduce stress on their nervous system. Even if every day is a little different, building small rituals like affirmations or a funny handshake into every morning can help kids experience something expected.

  1. **Engage in Calming Activities Together ![](https://encompassnw.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/coloring-image-300x200.jpg)**

  Physical touch, mindfulness exercises, or activities that engage the senses can help activate the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for relaxation. Try deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or gentle activities like coloring or playing outside in nature. Engage in these activities with your child to foster a sense of connection and safety. When kids see their favorite adult doing something, they are much more likely to give it a try.

  1. **Practice Active Listening**

  When people feel stressed, they need to feel heard. Instead of immediately offering solutions and moving quickly to problem-solving, try to listen attentively to your child’s concerns. Use empathetic phrases like, “It sounds like you’re feeling upset because things are different than last week,” and validate their emotions by saying things like, “I’d probably feel confused about that too!”. This not only helps them process their feelings but also reinforces the trust and connection between you and your child.&nbsp; When people feel heard and see that we aren’t dismissing their worries, they automatically begin to relax into the safety of the relationship.

  1. **Model Calmness and Emotional Regulation**

  Many kids are highly attuned to their caregivers’ emotional states. When you model calmness, even in stressful situations, children learn how to regulate their own emotions.&nbsp; The key here is authenticity.&nbsp; ‘Faking it till you make it’ won’t work well with coregulation.&nbsp; &nbsp;Practice taking deep breaths, pausing before reacting, and naming your emotions (“I feel frustrated right now, but I’m going to take a moment to calm down.”).&nbsp; Acknowledging your feelings and showing your child how you are working through them will help them recognize that feelings are temporary and not something to be afraid of.

  1. **Offer Simple Choices to Empower Kids**

  When routines change, people can feel a loss of control. Giving them small, manageable choices throughout the day, like what shirt to wear, which crunchy snack to eat, or what fun activity to do, will help them feel more at ease and less reactive. This can reduce feelings of stress and frustration, allowing their nervous system to feel more balanced.

  1. **Offer Redos Consistently**

  When routines are changing and kids are trying new things, they are going to mess up.&nbsp; They are going to be extra grumpy sometimes or more impulsive at other times.&nbsp; Try not to react and instead get curious about what might be going on underneath the behavior.&nbsp; We’ve all had moments when we say or do something we wish we hadn’t when we are feeling stressed.&nbsp; Give your child the gift of a second or even third chance to try that again without a harsh response.&nbsp; We all need that from time to time.

  By focusing on connection and offering soothing, supportive strategies, parents and caregivers can help their children navigate the emotional challenges of summer break with greater ease. A calm and predictable environment provides the stability children need to process their emotions and stay grounded, no matter how much their world may be shifting.&nbsp; If you or your child needs a little more support, please reach out to Encompass.&nbsp; We are here to help.
