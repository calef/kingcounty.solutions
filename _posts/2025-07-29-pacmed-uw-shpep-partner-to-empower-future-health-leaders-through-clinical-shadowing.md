  <p>This summer, Pacific Medical Centers (PacMed) proudly partnered with the <a href="https://equity.uwmedicine.org/shpep/">University of Washington’s Summer Health Professions Education Program (SHPEP)</a> to provide immersive clinical shadowing experiences for aspiring health professionals.</p>
  <p>The UW SHPEP is a free, six-week enrichment program designed to support college students from backgrounds underrepresented in the health professions. Hosted by the UW School of Medicine, Dentistry, and Public Health, the program offers academic enrichment in biology, chemistry, and population health, along with career development, wellness, and hands-on learning. Through a lens of social justice, SHPEP scholars explore the social determinants of health and health disparities while preparing for successful applications to health professions schools.</p>
  <p>This initiative is made possible through the leadership of the <a href="https://equity.uwmedicine.org/wihse/">Center for Workforce Inclusion and Healthcare System Equity (WIHSE)</a>, which coordinates the SHPEP program at UW and works to build a more diverse and equitable healthcare workforce.</p>

Pacific Medical Centers (PacMed) has partnered with the University of Washington’s Summer Health Professions Education Program (SHPEP) to provide clinical shadowing experiences for aspiring health professionals. This six-week enrichment program is designed for college students from backgrounds underrepresented in health professions, offering academic enrichment in subjects such as biology and chemistry, along with career development and hands-on learning. SHPEP scholars investigate social determinants of health and health disparities, preparing for health professions school applications. 

Dr. Sonja Maddox, an alumna of the UW School of Medicine and a key figure in this initiative, facilitated the opportunity for 15 SHPEP students to shadow various clinicians at PacMed. Participating clinicians included Drs. Alexander Cantrell, Soumya Choudhury, and Vik Dabhi, among others. By allowing these students to observe clinical practices, PacMed is helping to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical experience, contributing to a more diverse healthcare workforce. This initiative exemplifies the impact of mentorship and community investment in shaping the future of medicine.
