  of a new nationwide mental health crisis lifeline, Crisis Connections, has helped
  lead the launch of 988 in Washington State.\n\nSince the launch last July,our 988
  line has **answered more than 35,000 calls in King County** , quickly becoming an
  essential resource for people in crisis.&nbsp;\n\nCrisis Connections staff have
  done a remarkable job getting 988 off the ground and have consistently provided
  compassionate care to callers across our region. Looking ahead, we are eager to&nbsp;
  **expand into text and chat support** , **reach historically marginalized communities**
  ,&nbsp;and **increase our marketing, awareness, and social media efforts** so that
  more people are aware of the service and feel welcome to reach out for help.&nbsp;\n\n##
  \  \n**Peer-to-Peer Support**\n\nThe world can feel overwhelming even if one is
  not in an immediate crisis. No one has to face it alone. This is why **we are seeing
  more calls to our peer-to-peer support lines**. If you know an adult grappling with
  life’s complexities or a teen weathering life’s storms, our Warm Line and Teen Link
  offer understanding from peers who have been there. It’s not about professional
  advice or crisis support but a shared peer-to-peer connection. A listening ear can
  guide you during stress, doubt, or isolation. ![\U0001F31F](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f31f.png)

  voices of compassion and understanding. As the demand for Crisis Connections grows,
  **we urgently require volunteers** —spanning the **Crisis Line** , **Warm Line**
  , and **Teen Link**.\n\nWhether it is you or someone you know—Imagine being the
