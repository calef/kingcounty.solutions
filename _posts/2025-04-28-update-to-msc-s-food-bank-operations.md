MSC is updating its food bank operations to better serve the community amid declining funding and increasing demand due to inflation and rising food costs. Efforts to address the budget deficit have included launching a monthly giving program and reducing organizational expenses, including a 50% staffing reduction. Despite these efforts, funding remains insufficient to maintain previous operations.

Effective July 7, 2025, MSC's food bank will move to the new Redondo Heights Food Bank Market, discontinuing food distribution at the current Federal Way location. The new facility is designed to enhance client experience by providing more choice and dignity, as well as eliminating long wait times through weekly appointments. The Redondo Heights location is accessible by bus and offers ample parking.

While the organization anticipates a short closure of two weeks or less for the transition, MSC is committed to continuing food services, including home delivery and mobile services for senior communities. The leadership expresses confidence in navigating these challenges and emphasizes a commitment to building equitable and thriving communities through this transition.
