New traffic lights have been activated along State Route 7/Pacific Avenue South in Pierce County, enhancing pedestrian safety for walkers and cyclists. As of the week of November 10, crews from the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) have installed and activated lights at ten intersections in Parkland and Spanaway. These lights, mounted on a mast arm and pole, show green arrows when inactive and turn red when activated, stopping vehicle traffic to allow safe crossing. The intersection at SR 7 and 155th Street South is set to be activated at a later date; WSDOT will announce the schedule soon. Additional work includes daytime lane closures for the installation of permanent pavement markings. This $8.8 million project began in April and replaces earlier signs with rapid flashing lights, while also upgrading sidewalks to meet ADA standards and extending median islands. Funding comes from a grant through the Pedestrian & Bicycle Program and state funding related to Washington’s Climate Commitment Act, which aims to reduce climate pollution and improve public health.
