Montana, a 2013-2014 Beyond the Cure Ambassador Scholarship recipient, has shown remarkable resilience after being diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma at ages 2 and 14. Her experiences with cancer motivated her to pursue a nursing career, specifically to support childhood cancer patients at the same hospital where she received treatment. Enrolling at Georgia Regents University with the help of the NCCS scholarship, Montana also contributed to the childhood cancer community by serving as a judge for the scholarship program since 2017.

After earning her nursing degree, Montana worked on the inpatient hematology-oncology floor where she was once a patient. She later married another cancer survivor and continued her career at a pediatric outpatient surgical center, eventually returning to the hospital where she received radiation therapy. Today, she collaborates with the radiation oncologist who treated her. Montana expresses her passion for nursing, emphasizing the importance of inspiring others and fostering hope. She views children battling cancer as "tiny superheroes" and encourages aspiring nurses to pursue their dreams, highlighting the rewarding nature of the profession. Her ultimate mission is to inspire faith and hope in others.
