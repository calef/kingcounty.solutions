  One of the [USAGov](https://www.usa.gov/mission-history) program’s core focus areas is improving the benefits experience for our users. With customer experience in mind, we’re excited to share a significant change coming this fall. [Benefits.gov](https://www.benefits.gov), which has been hosted by the Department of Labor since 2002, will be sunsetting at the end of September, and we're creating a new benefits experience on [USA.gov](https://usa.gov/) and [USAGov en Español](https://www.usa.gov/es/).

A new benefits experience is set to launch on USAGov this fall, replacing Benefits.gov, which will sunset at the end of September 2024. This transition aims to centralize government benefits information and enhance user experience on both USA.gov and USAGov en Español. By employing a data-driven content strategy, the initiative will simplify access to resources related to health care, housing, food, unemployment, and more, making USAGov the primary source for government benefits information. Further updates will be provided as the transition date approaches.
