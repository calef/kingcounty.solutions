The Seattle Human Services Department has launched a Request for Proposals (RFP) to distribute nearly $15 million aimed at enhancing community safety. This funding initiative is designed to support a continuum of services focused on prevention, intervention, and restoration, specifically targeting gun violence reduction and neighborhood stabilization. The RFP was opened on September 23, 2025, and will close on November 12, 2025. Selected service providers will implement programs that include intervention strategies in neighborhoods, schools, and hospitals, along with school safety initiatives like conflict mediation and family resource funding. The investment will prioritize communities historically impacted by systemic underfunding and high gun violence rates, including areas such as the Central District and Southeast Seattle. This effort is a result of collaborative partnerships with community organizations, the Seattle Police Department, and local schools, aiming to improve service coordination and effectiveness. HSD Director Tanya Kim emphasized the importance of timely, trauma-informed support and the ongoing learning from community partners to enhance safety measures.
