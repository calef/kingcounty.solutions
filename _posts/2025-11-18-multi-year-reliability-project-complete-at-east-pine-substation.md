Installation of a new 150-ton transformer at the East Pine Substation marks the completion of a multi-year reliability project by Seattle City Light (SCL). This project involved significant upgrades to improve power reliability for customers in Seattle's Central District, First Hill, and Capitol Hill, including local hospitals. Substations play a critical role in the electrical system by transforming voltage levels and ensuring safe electricity distribution. The upgrades enhance power capacity, safety, and monitoring capabilities while meeting modern seismic standards.

The East Pine Substation, operational since the 1960s and designated a Seattle Landmark in 2019, houses four transformers. Each new transformer, weighing over 100 tons, was transported hundreds of miles by rail and truck to Seattle. The new equipment is expected to last 40 to 50 years. The project involved extensive collaboration among various teams, including civil and electrical engineers, construction crews, and apprentices, reflecting a collective effort to support regional growth and improve service reliability. SCL looks forward to sharing further updates on ongoing improvements to its services.
