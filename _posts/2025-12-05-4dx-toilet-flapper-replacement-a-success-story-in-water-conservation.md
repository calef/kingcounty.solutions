  <p>As part of our ambitious 4DX goals, Mercy Housing embarked on the 4DX Toilet Flapper Replacement project early this year. This initiative aimed to replace all toilet flappers across the entire portfolio. While toilet flappers may not seem significant, their performance has a surprisingly large impact on water consumption. Leaking or aging flappers are one of the most common causes of water waste in buildings, often going unnoticed until significant losses have already occurred.</p>
  <p>Through the 4DX initiative, we set out to systematically replace flappers across all Mercy Housing properties, targeting both water savings and cost reduction. The results speak for themselves:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><strong>73% Portfolio Coverage</strong>: Flappers were successfully replaced in nearly three-quarters of Mercy Housing properties.</li>
  <li><strong>5% Water Savings</strong>: Properties where replacements occurred saw an average reduction of 5% in total water use.</li>
  <li><strong>45 Million Gallons Saved Annually</strong>: This equates to enough water to fill nearly 70 Olympic-sized swimming pools every year.</li>
  <li><strong>$866,000 in Projected Annual Cost Savings</strong>: This combined financial impact directly strengthens property performance while reducing operating costs.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>By tackling an often-overlooked source of water waste, we’re conserving millions of gallons of water while driving meaningful cost savings for our properties. This success was made possible through the hard work and commitment of property staff throughout the portfolio, and the utility savings 4DX team.</p>
  <p>Thank you to everyone who dedicated their time to this project!</p>

Mercy Housing recently completed a successful initiative to replace toilet flappers in its properties, significantly contributing to water conservation efforts. The program focused on the 4DX toilet flapper, which has been shown to reduce water wastage. By replacing outdated and inefficient flappers, Mercy Housing aims to decrease the amount of water used per flush, which can lead to substantial savings on water bills and promote sustainable practices within its communities. 

The initiative involved assessing existing toilets and implementing the replacements in various housing units across its network. Residents have already reported improvements in toilet functionality and reduced water usage, highlighting the positive impact of the program. This project demonstrates Mercy Housing's commitment to environmental sustainability and the importance of efficient water management in affordable housing settings. The successful flapper replacement initiative serves as a model for other organizations looking to enhance water conservation efforts in their properties.
