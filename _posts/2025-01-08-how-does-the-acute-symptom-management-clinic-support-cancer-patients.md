The Acute Symptom Management Clinic (ASMC) at Valley’s Cancer Center is designed to provide critical support for cancer patients experiencing non-life-threatening symptoms. This clinic, part of the Oncology & Hematology Clinic, allows for prompt assessment and treatment through coordination with Oncology Nurse Navigators and Nurse Practitioners. By offering timely care, the ASMC helps patients avoid long waits at urgent care or emergency departments, reducing their risk of infections and lowering out-of-pocket costs.

For instance, a cancer patient reporting body aches and a mild fever was quickly triaged and treated at the ASMC, receiving antibiotics for an infection without needing to visit urgent care. Currently, the clinic operates with one Advanced Registered Nurse Practitioner (ARNP), Jaycee Wong, but is expanding to three providers, enhancing its capacity. With plans to extend services to the Infusion & Immunotherapy Center and to operate seven days a week, the ASMC aims to improve patient care and experiences significantly, ensuring timely treatment and continuity of care within a trusted clinical team.
