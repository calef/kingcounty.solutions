Inatai Foundation has welcomed two new team members, Alieu Samateh and Michelle Galvan, to enhance its operations across Washington. Alieu, based in Snohomish County, serves as the IT Service Desk Associate, providing technical support to remote team members and ensuring efficient technology operations. He is a member of the Gambian community in Seattle and has a strong commitment to racial justice, alongside his volunteer work and teaching web development courses. Michelle, from Yakima County, joins as an Accountant, where she is responsible for managing payments to grantees, vendors, and contractors. With over ten years of accounting experience, she values her roots in the Mexican American community and enjoys spending time with her family. The foundation expresses gratitude for the contributions of both individuals, who are dedicated to supporting community leaders and organizations throughout the state.
