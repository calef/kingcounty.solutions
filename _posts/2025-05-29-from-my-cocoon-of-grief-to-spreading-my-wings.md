original_content: "<p class=\"\"><strong><em>By Nikita</em></strong>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">If
  you told me a few years ago that I’d be living in a three-bedroom apartment with
  my three kids, thriving in my preschool teaching career, and excitedly planning
  our first vacation with just the four of us, I never would’ve believed you.&nbsp;</p><p
  class=\"\">It all started with what was supposed to be a one week visit with family
  in Washington. I came down from Alaska with my kids and their dad, Thomas, thinking
  we’d be back home in a few days. But during that visit, Thomas was hit by a car.
  He was in the hospital here, and it just wasn’t possible—or affordable—to fly him
  back to Alaska. And honestly, Alaska didn’t even have the kind of care he needed.
  So, we stayed.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">At first, the kids and I were living with
  my mom. But about nine months later, Thomas passed away from his injuries. The grief
  hit me hard. And as much as I wanted to lean on my mom, she was struggling with
  her own mental health and just couldn’t give me the kind of support I needed. One
  day, she just told me we had to go—right then and there. Within the hour I was homeless
  with three kids, grieving, and completely overwhelmed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">We
  slept in our car for a few days—until it broke down from running the heater constantly.
  I used what little money I had to get a hotel for about a week, and a few friends
  helped me stretch it out to ten days. After that, I didn’t know what else to do.
  We ended up staying at an acquaintance's place—he had a couch and offered us a place
  to sleep. It wasn’t long before that situation became uncomfortable, and I knew
  we had to leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">That’s when I started calling 2-1-1,
  and someone told me about Mary’s Place. I called every single day for six days straight,
  and finally, they had a spot for us. They even called me an Uber to get there that
  night. I had no idea what to expect, but what I found at Mary’s Place was something
  I’ll never forget.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">Being at Mary’s Place was such a blessing.
  I had my kids with me, including a baby who was still breastfeeding, and I didn’t
  have to worry about our family being split up. Usually, you think of a shelter as
  just a place to sleep, bunk beds in one big room or sleeping bags in a church, and
  maybe you’ll get a meal or two. But at Mary’s Place my kids and I had our own room,
  three meals a day, and the privacy and support to heal and start figuring out what
  came next.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">At first, it was a lot. You’re getting handed
  so many resources, and everyone’s trying to help. When you’re still grieving and
  trying to hold it together for your kids, it can feel overwhelming. But then I just
  sat down and started taking it step by step. I had my notepad, I’d take photos of
  flyers in lobby, write down apartment info, talk to my Mary’s Place housing specialist.
  We worked as a team. They’d help me find lists of places to call, and I did research
  on my own too. They’d help me apply, and they even helped with the deposit and first
  month’s rent when I finally found a place.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">When I first got
  to Mary’s Place, I hardly had anything. Most of our clothes were either in storage
  or lost when the car got towed. But the Marketplace at Mary’s Place—wow! It sounds
  silly, but it really felt like retail therapy and a sense of normalcy. I was able
  to pick out clothes for interviews, for my kids, for everyday life—and when you
  look better, you feel better and more motivated.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">I applied
  for a job at a daycare near the shelter, just aiming for an associate role—but they
  offered me the manager position! I was shocked. The Mary’s Place staff even watched
  my kids during the interview and were all cheering for me when I came back with
  the news. I’ll never forget that moment, I want to cry just thinking about it. I
  felt so seen. It was the first time in a long time that I didn’t feel alone.&nbsp;</p><p
  class=\"\">Over time, I got close with some of the other moms at the shelter. We’d
  get together in the mornings, swap resources, and just help each other out. Eventually,
  the group grew, and the Site Director started calling our meetings the “Butterfly
  Home” group, because we were all in our cocoons, but the sense of community helped
  us start to emerge, and together we were getting ready to fly into our own places.
  I still love that.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">After about eight months, I got approved
  for a three-bedroom apartment. It felt huge after sharing one room with all my kids.
  It’s affordable, spacious, and best of all, it’s <em>ours</em>.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">The
  building is close to the Allen Family Center, where Mary’s Place and other groups
  offer all kinds of classes and support. I recently finished a 10-week class on emotional
  connection with your kids and healing from trauma. It helped me so much as a mom.
  One day, I overheard the staff talking about wanting a logo for the building. I
  told them, “Hey, I love design—I’d be happy to help.” That’s always been a dream
  of mine: becoming a graphic designer or even a private chef someday. With where
  I’m at now in my life, seeing my work on the side of a building like the Allen Family
  Center feels like a tangible goal instead of a faraway daydream.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

A mother of three, Nikita, reflects on her journey from grief to healing after the tragic loss of her partner, Thomas, who died following a car accident during a family visit to Washington. Initially living with her mother, Nikita faced homelessness after being asked to leave. She and her children experienced days of sleeping in their car and staying with acquaintances before finding shelter at Mary’s Place, which provided them with a private room, meals, and essential resources for recovery.

At Mary’s Place, Nikita gradually rebuilt her life, gaining support from staff and other mothers. She secured a managerial position at a daycare, which allowed her to provide for her family while also caring for her children. With assistance from Mary’s Place, she found an affordable three-bedroom apartment, completed a class on emotional healing, and even began exploring her passion for graphic design.

Now, Nikita works as a preschool teacher at a Montessori school, and she is planning her first vacation with her children, embracing a renewed sense of hope and excitement for the future after overcoming significant challenges.
