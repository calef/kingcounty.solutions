Mary's Place Make-a-Home program provides essential furnishings to families transitioning from homelessness to permanent housing, helping over 25 families each month. Many families, despite securing housing, find themselves without basic necessities, often sleeping on bare floors. The program addresses this gap, as some families lack transportation for furniture and must prioritize rent and food. Happy Hauler, led by owner John, is a key partner in this initiative, quickly delivering complete home furnishing sets on moving day. John emphasizes the importance of providing these items promptly, recognizing the significant impact a furnished home has on families’ well-being. 

One notable story involves a couple with a medically fragile son who needed to recover from surgery in a furnished home. With John's swift action, their apartment was fully furnished on moving day, alleviating their worries during a challenging time. John often recalls families escaping domestic violence, who arrive with nothing but the clothes on their backs. The support and kindness they receive from the community are vital in helping them rebuild their lives. Through partnerships like Happy Hauler, Mary's Place not only provides shelter but also helps families create stable, nurturing homes.
