Photographer Florene Jimerson, a 26-year-old Seattle native, reflects on her journey from childhood instability to finding a permanent home. Growing up amidst cycles of displacement and homelessness, Florene faced numerous challenges as her family's financial struggles led them to constantly move. Despite vowing to avoid homelessness after securing her own apartment at 18, she found herself in a dire situation five years later due to black mold in her home. After months of couch surfing and living in her car, she discovered an affordable apartment in her old neighborhood but lacked the funds for move-in costs.

Seeking assistance, Florene connected with Solid Ground, where she received help covering her move-in expenses. She describes her new apartment as a healing space that allows her to thrive creatively and personally. With newfound stability, she is determined to prevent future homelessness, viewing her home as a sanctuary for growth, creativity, and safety. Florene embraces this opportunity not only to heal from her past traumas but also to flourish in her passion for photography.
