On October 25, the Department of Education and Early Learning (DEEL) hosted the “Thrive & Vibe: A Youth Health and Wellness Celebration” at El Centro de la Raza’s Centilia Cultural Center in Beacon Hill, focusing on youth access to free mental wellness resources. The event featured youth performances, a resource fair, wellness workshops, and a keynote from Ray Roberts, a former Seattle Seahawks linebacker and mental health advocate. Participants engaged in various activities including fitness sessions led by Shontia Whitehead, mindfulness and yoga with Tai Mattox, and guided painting with Stephanie Morales, promoting self-care and community building. The resource fair included organizations like Celebrating Roots, NAMI Seattle, and Talkspace, providing information on mental health support for youth aged 13 to 24. Roberts emphasized the importance of seeking help, sharing his personal journey to mental wellness and encouraging youth to reach out for support. Attendees received wellness swag giveaways, including items from the Seahawks, and enjoyed a positive environment aimed at fostering confidence and collective wellness among Seattle's youth.
