Seattle Public Schools is implementing a new grading policy aimed at addressing inequities in grading practices across the district. The policy will be introduced in the 2023-2024 school year and focuses on ensuring that grades reflect a student's understanding of the material, rather than factors like behavior or attendance. The approach emphasizes mastery of content, allowing for retakes and reassessments to give students multiple opportunities to demonstrate their knowledge.

Additionally, the new grading system includes a shift away from traditional letter grades, opting instead for a more descriptive grading scale. This initiative is part of a broader effort to create a more equitable learning environment and improve student outcomes. Educators will receive training on the new policies to help them implement the changes effectively.

The district is also engaging with families and the community to ensure transparency and gather feedback on the new grading approach. By aligning grading practices with the principles of equity and student-centered learning, Seattle Public Schools aims to support all students in achieving their academic potential.
