Seattle Public Utilities has implemented new solid waste metrics to enhance the city's approach to waste management, moving beyond traditional recycling rates to focus on waste prevention and reduction. The new performance framework includes five key metrics: daily pounds of municipal solid waste (MSW) generated and disposed of per person, annual tons of food waste disposed of, residential recycling capture rate, and construction and demolition debris diversion rate. These metrics aim for a 15% reduction in waste generation by 2030, aligning with Seattle's zero-waste vision and best practices from global leaders.

In the 2024 report, Seattle residents generated an average of 5.21 pounds of waste per person daily, marking the lowest figure since 2000. However, daily garbage disposal was at 2.68 pounds per person, not meeting targets. The construction debris diversion rate was recorded at 68.6%, falling short of the 80% goal, while the residential recycling capture rate was at 74%, exceeding the national average. The report highlights the importance of community participation in waste reduction efforts, encouraging residents to adopt practices that minimize waste and enhance recycling effectiveness.
