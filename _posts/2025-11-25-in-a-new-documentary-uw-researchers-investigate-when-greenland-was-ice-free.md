title: In a new documentary, UW researchers investigate when Greenland was ice-free

In a new documentary titled "The Memory of Darkness, Light and Ice," researchers from the University of Washington explore Greenland's climate history, particularly when parts of the region were ice-free approximately 400,000 years ago. The documentary highlights findings from sediment and ice samples collected during the 1960s at Camp Century, a U.S. military base in Greenland. These samples were rediscovered in 2019, leading to collaborative research aimed at understanding climate change over extended periods.

Director Kathy Kasic interviews scientists, including UW professor Eric Steig, who discuss their analysis of isotopes in water preserved in sediment, revealing temperature changes and ecological shifts throughout history. The research indicates there was a prolonged warm period, offering insights into the conditions when the Greenland ice sheet was less extensive. As the ice sheet continues to melt, this research is crucial for refining models predicting future sea-level rise. The documentary emphasizes a shift in focus from past ice ages to understanding warmer climates, which aligns with current climate trajectories.
