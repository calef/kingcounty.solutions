  <p>City leaders, housing advocates, and community members came together in SoMa to celebrate the opening of 600 Seventh, a landmark affordable housing development at 7th and Brannan Streets that redefines what inclusive urban living can look like.</p>
  <p>The eight-story building is designed to inspire connection and joy. Families enjoy two landscaped courtyards with play structures and seating areas, game rooms and study nooks on every floor, and a spacious community room for gatherings. Select apartments and shared spaces offer sweeping views of the Bay Bridge and city skyline. At street level, 4,000 sq<u>u</u>are feet of retail space will welcome community-serving businesses, adding energy and opportunity to the neighborhood.</p>
  <h2>Mixed-Use Community for Families</h2>
  <p>Developed by Mercy Housing California in partnership with the City of San Francisco, Episcopal Community Services (ECS), and key financial partners, this vibrant mixed-use community offers 220 modern apartment homes for families earning up to 78% of the Area Median Income with 120 of these homes providing permanent supportive housing for individuals and families who have experienced homelessness.</p>
  <p>“600 Seventh demonstrates that San Francisco can truly be a city for everyone,” said Tiffany Bohee, President of Mercy Housing California. “By combining affordability, quality design, and comprehensive services, we’re proving that real solutions to the housing crisis are possible. Together, we’re building stability, opportunity, and a sense of belonging in SoMa. We are deeply grateful to the City of San Francisco and ECS for their partnership in making this vision a reality.”</p>
  <p>The ribbon cutting, held in 600 Seventh’s family wing, brought together local leaders, residents, and partners to celebrate a transformative milestone for housing equity.</p>
  <p>Mayor Daniel Lurie praised the development as a model for addressing housing insecurity, “From my first day in office, I have stressed the importance of creating affordable housing so that the next generation of San Franciscans can afford to raise their kids in the city they love,” said Mayor Lurie. “Today, we are taking another step to do that—turning an empty lot into a place where people will live, work, and build community. Projects like this one are exactly what our Family Zoning plan will support—more homes for families and more opportunities for San Franciscans to stay in the city they call home”</p>
  <h2>Helping People Find Stability in Their Lives</h2>
  <p>Supervisor Matt Dorsey, who represents District 6, emphasized the urgency of building more affordable housing, “600 Seventh Street represents a practical step toward addressing San Francisco’s crucial housing needs,” said Dorsey, “This site adds affordable homes and will help people find stability in their lives.”</p>

600 Seventh Street has officially opened in San Francisco, providing 100 units of affordable housing for low-income families and individuals. This development includes a mix of one, two, and three-bedroom apartments, with a focus on serving those who have experienced homelessness. The project aims to address the critical need for affordable housing in the city, which has been exacerbated by rising rents and housing shortages.

The building features various amenities such as community spaces, a computer lab, and outdoor areas for residents. It also incorporates sustainable design elements, promoting energy efficiency and environmental responsibility. The development was made possible through a collaboration between Mercy Housing, the city of San Francisco, and various funding partners.

Mayor London Breed emphasized the importance of creating more affordable housing options to support vulnerable communities in San Francisco. With the opening of 600 Seventh Street, the city takes a step forward in its commitment to combat homelessness and provide stable housing solutions. This project represents a significant contribution to the ongoing efforts to enhance the quality of life for residents in the area.
