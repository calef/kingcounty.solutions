The Washington State Department of Health (DOH) is urging residents to receive updated vaccines for COVID-19, influenza, and RSV as the holiday season approaches. Vaccination rates have declined over the past three years, with significant decreases noted this season. To assist, DOH has introduced a new Respiratory Immunization Dashboard that tracks immunization data for these viruses by county and demographic. While RSV immunizations for infants are increasing, many remain unimmunized. DOH emphasizes the importance of vaccination to protect against serious illness and alleviate pressure on the healthcare system.
