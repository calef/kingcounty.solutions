  **Effective today, August 31 at 1200 (noon),&nbsp;**The King County Fire Chief’s Association in coordination with the King County Fire Marshals are terminating the Stage 2 Burn Ban. This will allow burning of small recreational fires to resume. Recent cooler weather, increased humidity, and anticipated precipitation have allowed wildland fuels to recover moisture, and the local wildland fire danger has reduced to a level where it is safe to resume small recreational fires. The Stage I Burn Ban (restrictions), issued in July which covers all other outdoor burning, will remain in effect until further notice.

The King County Fire Chief’s Association and the King County Fire Marshals have terminated the Stage 2 Burn Ban as of August 31st, 2023. This decision is due to recent cooler weather, increased humidity, and expected rainfall which have allowed wildland fuels to regain moisture. Consequently, the local wildland fire danger level has decreased, making it safe to resume small recreational fires. However, the Stage 1 Burn Ban, which was issued in July and prohibits all other outdoor burning, will continue to be in effect until further notice.
