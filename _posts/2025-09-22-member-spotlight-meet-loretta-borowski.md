Fifteen years ago, Loretta Borowski sought support after being diagnosed with a degenerative eye condition that forced her to stop driving. A neighbor introduced her to Eastside Friends of Seniors, and she has been an integral part of the community since. Loretta has served for the past 10 years on the board of Hutchinson House, the senior living apartment complex she has called home for 20 years, advocating for her neighbors. She appreciates the kindness and compassion of the volunteer drivers, stating they never make her feel like a burden. Loretta values her visits with her volunteer, Renee, who comes by twice a month for companionship. Recently, Loretta attended her first Eastside Friends of Seniors event and was inspired by the women she met. She expressed her love for people and emphasized the uniqueness of the organization. Loretta wants volunteers to know their value and how much they are appreciated. The community is grateful to have her and the volunteers who help create meaningful connections.
