  Flood season is here, and the King County Flood Control District (District) is reminding residents that sandbag materials are available **free of charge** to help protect homes, businesses, and property from potential flooding. This program is part of the District’s ongoing commitment to help residents prepare, respond, and recover from flood events as part of its **Be Flood Ready** campaign.

  Sandbag materials are available at multiple locations throughout King County, including in flood-prone areas along the Snoqualmie, Tolt, Green, Cedar, and Duwamish rivers. Residents can find a full list of locations and instructions for proper sandbag use at [kingcountyfloodcontrol.org/flood-resources/sandbag-distribution](https://kingcountyfloodcontrol.org/flood-resources/sandbag-distribution/).

  “Preparing for flooding before heavy rain arrives can make a huge difference in protecting people and property,” said **King County Flood Control District Chair Reagan Dunn**. “The Flood Control District invests in flood risk reduction projects across King County, but we also want residents to have the tools and information they need to protect their homes and neighborhoods. Programs like free sandbag distribution are an important part of keeping our communities safe.”

  The King County area typically experiences its highest flood risks between October and April, when heavy rainfall, saturated soils, and rising river levels can combine to cause flooding. Flooding can be particularly challenging in areas near the Duwamish River, where flood risks can increase when high tides combine with heavy rain events.

  “As we enter flood season, we encourage residents, especially those living or working near the Duwamish River, to prepare ahead of time,” said **King County Flood Control District Supervisor Teresa Mosqueda**. “When rain events coincide with King Tides, flood risk can rise quickly. Taking advantage of the free sandbag program now is a simple, effective way to protect your property.”

  King Tides are the highest predicted tides of the year. They are above the highest water level reached by an average daily high tide. The **2025–2026 King Tides** are expected to occur on the following dates:

  - **November 7–9, 2025**
  - **December 6–9, 2025**
  - **January 4–6, 2026**
