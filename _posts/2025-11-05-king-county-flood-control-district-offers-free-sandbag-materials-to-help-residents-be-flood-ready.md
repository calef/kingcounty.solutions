  “Be Flood Ready”

The King County Flood Control District is providing free sandbag materials to help residents protect their properties from potential flooding. This initiative is part of the District's 'Be Flood Ready' campaign. The materials are available at various locations across the county, particularly in flood-prone areas along the Snoqualmie, Tolt, Green, Cedar, and Duwamish rivers. The District also encourages residents to be prepared for flood risks, especially near the Duwamish River where high tides can amplify flood threats. Residents are urged to utilize the free sandbag program and make a preparedness plan. The District provides resources on flood alerts, insurance, evacuation routes, and floodplain maps on its website.
