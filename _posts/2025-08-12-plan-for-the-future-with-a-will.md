August is National Make-A-Will Month, a reminder for everyone to ensure they have an up-to-date will. A will protects your wishes, allows for the distribution of your assets as per your preferences, and offers relief to your family during a challenging time. Without a will, the state decides how your estate is handled, which might not align with your intentions. You can also include non-profits like the Eastside Legal Assistance Program (ELAP) in your will, providing future generations with access to free civil legal aid, and supporting vulnerable community members facing eviction, domestic violence, and life-altering crises.
