  August is National Make-A-Will Month, so it’s a good time to double-check that you have an up-to-date will.

  A will ensures that your wishes are known, your assets are distributed the way you want, and your family is spared unnecessary stress during an already difficult time. People at all income levels need to have a will. Without one, the state decides how your estate is handled—which may not reflect your intentions.

  And did you know that you can include a nonprofit like **Eastside Legal Assistance Program (ELAP)** in your will? It’s a meaningful way to leave a lasting legacy. Your gift can help ensure that future generations have access to free civil legal aid, protecting vulnerable community members from eviction, domestic violence, and other life-altering crises.

  Ways to support ELAP through your will include:

  - Leaving a **specific dollar amount** or asset
  - Designating a **percentage** of your estate
  - Naming ELAP as a **beneficiary** of a retirement account or life insurance policy

  Making a will is about more than planning—it’s about caring for the people and causes that matter most to you. This month, take the time to protect your legacy and strengthen our community.

August is National Make-A-Will Month, a reminder for everyone to ensure they have an up-to-date will. A will protects your wishes, allows for the distribution of your assets as per your preferences, and offers relief to your family during a challenging time. Without a will, the state decides how your estate is handled, which might not align with your intentions. You can also include non-profits like the Eastside Legal Assistance Program (ELAP) in your will, providing future generations with access to free civil legal aid, and supporting vulnerable community members facing eviction, domestic violence, and life-altering crises.
