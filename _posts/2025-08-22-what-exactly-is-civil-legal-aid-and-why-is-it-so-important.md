Civil legal aid provides free legal advice for individuals facing civil legal issues such as domestic violence, housing evictions, and medical bills. The Eastside Legal Assistance Program (ELAP) aims to assist those whom the legal system does not adequately support. The number of housing evictions has more than doubled in King and Kitsap Counties from 2023 to 2024, illustrating the demand for such services. ELAP's assistance can help prevent stress, financial instability, and injustice. Despite funding cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), ELAP continues to provide free legal help, enabling vulnerable individuals to understand and assert their legal rights.
