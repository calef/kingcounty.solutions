The Snoqualmie Tribe is inviting Indigenous artists to participate in a logo design project for its partnership programs with Reclaim and Trail Youth. This call for artists aims to promote cultural expression through visual art and encourage participation from the Indigenous community. Interested artists can find more information about the submission process and requirements. The announcement also highlights recent news, including the passing of beloved tribal elders Irene Daniels and Marguerite Bertha Walden, and upcoming events such as the Thanksgiving break, Christmas tree thinning gathering, and the tribal Christmas party.
