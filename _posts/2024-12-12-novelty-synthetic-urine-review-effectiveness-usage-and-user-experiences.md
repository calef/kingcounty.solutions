Total Stealth Brand Novelty Urine is a synthetic urine product sold for $29.99, intended exclusively for novelty uses. The manufacturers emphasize that it should not be used for illegal activities, such as cheating on drug tests. This synthetic urine is designed to closely mimic the appearance, texture, and chemical composition of real human urine, making it suitable for various applications, including theatrical performances and educational demonstrations. 

Key ingredients include urea, creatinine, uric acid, and sodium chloride, which replicate the properties of natural urine. Users are advised to ensure the product is at a temperature between 90°F and 100°F before use, as this affects its realism. The product is reusable if properly maintained, but it does not have the characteristic smell of real urine, which some users find detracting.

Customers appreciate the realistic appearance and reasonable price of Total Stealth Brand Novelty Urine. However, it is not suitable for drug testing, and some users have reported issues with temperature regulation. Overall, it serves well for its intended novelty applications but should be used responsibly in accordance with the manufacturer's guidelines.
