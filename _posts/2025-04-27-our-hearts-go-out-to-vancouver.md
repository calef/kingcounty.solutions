Our hearts ache with you following the senseless violence at the Lapu-Lapu Day Block Party in Vancouver, BC. What should have been a joyful celebration of Filipino heritage has been marred by tragedy. The Filipino Community of Seattle and performers of FCS Kalahi extend their deepest compassion and unwavering support to the families of those who were lost and to everyone injured. Solidarity is expressed with the Vancouver Filipino community during this incredibly difficult time. The message emphasizes finding strength in unity and cherishing the memories of those lost as a source of comfort and guidance. Thoughts and prayers are with the affected community.
