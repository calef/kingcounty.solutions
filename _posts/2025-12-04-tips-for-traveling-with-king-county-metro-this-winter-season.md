Traveling with King County Metro during the winter season requires some preparation to ensure a smooth experience. Riders are encouraged to check service alerts and updates regularly, especially with potential weather-related changes. It's important to plan ahead by allowing extra travel time, as winter conditions can impact schedules. 

Riders should dress warmly and be prepared for colder temperatures when waiting for buses. It is advisable to arrive at stops early and to have a backup plan in case of delays. Keeping a safe distance from the curb is recommended to avoid any hazards posed by icy sidewalks and roads. 

For those using ORCA cards, ensuring they are charged and ready for use can help avoid last-minute issues. Metro also suggests using the Transit app for real-time tracking of buses and service alerts. 

Additionally, travelers should be aware that some routes may be affected by snow or ice, leading to detours or adjusted service. Taking these precautions can help make winter travel with King County Metro safer and more efficient.
