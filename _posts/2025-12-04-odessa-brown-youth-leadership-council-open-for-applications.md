The Odessa Brown Youth Leadership Council is now accepting applications for new members. This initiative aims to empower young people from the community to engage in leadership and advocacy for health equity and social justice. The council is particularly focused on amplifying the voices of youth who have been historically marginalized. Members will have opportunities to develop leadership skills, participate in community service, and influence health policies that affect their peers. Interested youth aged 13 to 21 are encouraged to apply, with the application process open until January 31, 2026. Selected members will receive training, support, and mentorship to help them succeed in their roles. The council emphasizes the importance of youth perspectives in shaping community health initiatives and policies.
