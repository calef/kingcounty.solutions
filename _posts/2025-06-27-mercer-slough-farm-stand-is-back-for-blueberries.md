U-pick blueberries have returned to Mercer Slough after several years, resuming on June 28-29, with hours from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Beginning July 8, U-pick will be available Tuesday to Saturday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sundays from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. The farm stands at Mercer Slough and Larsen Lake, which sell fresh produce and flowers, will operate Wednesday to Saturday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sundays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The first 200 customers purchasing U-pick blueberries at Mercer Slough starting July 8 will receive complimentary ice cream sandwiches. A new farm stand was built in August 2024 to replace the previous one affected by Sound Transit construction. The Mercer Slough stand is conveniently located near the South Bellevue light rail stop and includes a small parking lot and restrooms. The stands reflect Bellevue’s agricultural heritage, dating back to the city’s acquisition of the Overlake Blueberry Farm in 1979, which has been part of the area since the 1930s. The Mercer Slough master plan emphasizes the preservation and diversification of Bellevue’s agricultural history.
