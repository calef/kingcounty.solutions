original_content: "**Begins**\n\nBy Steven Schauer, Deputy Executive Director\n\nAs
  the rainy season returns to the Pacific Northwest, so does the risk of flooding.
  In King County, flood season runs from October through April, bringing with it the
  potential for swollen rivers, rising groundwater, and storm-related impacts. Flooding
  remains one of the largest risks to people and property in our region, making preparation
  essential for every household and community.\n\n![](https://kingcountyfloodcontrol.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Flooding-on-the-Snoqualmie-River-1986-credit-KC.jpg)\n_1986

  Preparedness Outreach**\n\nIn July, the King County Flood Control District (KCFCD)
  Board of Supervisors took a significant step to strengthen our community’s flood
  resilience. The [Board unanimously approved a motion to expand flood preparedness
  outreach and education programs](https://kingcountyfloodcontrol.org/king-county-flood-control-district-unanimously-approves-motion-to-expand-flood-preparedness-outreach/),
  helping to ensure that more residents across the county have access to the information
  and tools they need to stay safe.\n\n![](https://kingcountyfloodcontrol.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Councilmember-Reagan-Dunn-Official-Portrait_600x900.jpg)\n\nThe
  approved motion directs the KCFCD to expand its Be Flood Ready public outreach and
  education efforts, provide additional resources on best management practices for
  flood risk reduction, and increase support for community engagement to better prepare
  residents and businesses for flood season.\n\nKing County Flood Control District
  Chair Reagan Dunn emphasized the importance of this action, noting that the Board
  acted swiftly in July following the devastating flooding in Texas. “The flooding
  we saw earlier this summer in Texas was a sobering reminder of how quickly lives
  can be upended when floodwaters rise,” Chair Dunn said. “Here in King County, we
  know floods are one of our most persistent natural hazards. By expanding our Be
  Flood Ready outreach and education programs, we’re giving our residents the tools
  they need to prepare, protect their families, and reduce risks before disaster strikes.”\n\nThis
  action reflects the District’s ongoing commitment to protect lives and property
  while empowering communities with knowledge to take proactive steps in reducing
  flood risks.\n\n## **Updated Be Flood Ready Resources**\n\nIn response to the Board’s
  direction, the KCFCD is enhancing its outreach tools this year in several new ways.\n\n###
  **Be Flood Ready Brochure – 2025 Update**\n\nEach year, the KCFCD publishes its
  Be Flood Ready brochure. King County, a service provider to the District, provides
  support for the creation of the brochure. The District’s Be Flood Ready brochure
  not only delivers important flood preparedness information to the public, but the
  publication also helps King County receive Community Rating System (CRS) credits
  from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). FEMA awards CRS credit to communities
  that implement more robust floodplain management activities beyond minimum National
  Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) requirements. These additional activities can include
  public outreach and community awareness messaging like the Be Flood Ready brochure.
  The FEMA CRS credit King County receives results in discounted premiums to policyholders
  of flood insurance throughout the county – the discount can range from 5% to 45%.\n\nThe
  Be Flood Ready brochure is mailed annually to residents across the county and is
  also available on the KCFCD’s [Be Flood Ready webpage](https://kingcountyfloodcontrol.org/flood-resources/be-flood-ready-brochure/).\n\n![](https://kingcountyfloodcontrol.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BFR-cover.jpg)\n\n-
  The countywide version is available in 23 languages, reflecting our commitment to
  reaching residents of all backgrounds.\n- Localized brochures are also created for
  Council Districts 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9. These are available in English and Spanish,
  with additional translation services available upon request.\n- This year, in response
  to the board’s direction to increase the Be Flood Ready outreach, the brochure was
  expanded from a 4-page brochure, as it has been for years, to an 8-page brochure.
  The brochure’s expansion provided an opportunity to add more visuals, redesign the
  content, and add new graphic information, like the panel helping to explain the
  types of flooding that King County residents may experience.\n\n![](https://kingcountyfloodcontrol.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/types-of-flooding-in-King-County.jpg)\n_Types
  of Flooding In King County_\n\n### **New Be Flood Ready Video**\n\nFor the first
  time, the KCFCD produced a Be Flood Ready video, which is now featured on the KCFCD’s
  [Flood Resources webpage](https://kingcountyfloodcontrol.org/flood-resources/).
  This video provides residents with clear, practical guidance on how to prepare for,
  respond to, and recover from flood events. It is also being turned into short clips
  which will be shared on social media throughout the flood season.\n\n[![](https://kingcountyfloodcontrol.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BFR-video.jpg)](https://vimeo.com/1126035319/6707d6d65f)\n_2025
  Be Flood Ready video_\n\n### **Additional outreach along the Duwamish River**\n\nAnother
  first for the KCFCD – this year, properties along the Duwamish River will also receive
  a postcard providing the dates for potential King Tides expected during the 2025-2026
  winter season. While not a scientific term, a King Tide is generally used to describe
  exceptionally high tides. Flood risks can increase along the Duwamish River during
  King Tides, particularly if these unusually high tides occur during a rain event.\n\n![](https://kingcountyfloodcontrol.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/king-tides-postcard-1024x688.jpg)\n_2025

  come**\n\nThe KCFCD is continuing to research ways to improve flood preparedness
  outreach. For example, on October 2<sup>nd</sup>, KCFCD staff participated in a
  national panel discussion webinar on Flood Warning Systems hosted by the National
  Association of Flood and Stormwater Management Agencies (NAFSMA). Staff shared information
  about the flood preparedness efforts funded by the KCFCD and implemented by its
  service provider, King County. The discussion included reference to the [King County
  Flood Warning System](https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/dnrp/nature-recreation/environment-ecology-conservation/flood-services/warning-system),
  [Flood Warning App](https://flood.kingcounty.gov/), [Flood Alert](https://green2.kingcounty.gov/floodalertsystem/)
  program, and the Flood Warning Center.\n\n![](https://kingcountyfloodcontrol.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Flooding-on-the-Cedar-River-2020-credit-KC-1024x685.jpg)\n_2020

  explore new ways to enhance and expand the Be Flood Ready public outreach and education
  program, while also developing additional resources on best practices for reducing
  flood risk. Efforts will include strengthening community engagement to help residents
  and businesses prepare more effectively for flood season. Staff will provide regular
  updates to the Board of Supervisors as we work toward further improvements in 2026
  and beyond.\n\n## **Staying Prepared Together**\n\n![](https://kingcountyfloodcontrol.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/cm-perry-headshot-2025-768x1024.jpg)\n\nThe
  KCFCD remains committed to investing in flood risk reduction projects and programs
  that help safeguard people, property, and essential infrastructure. At the same
  time, preparedness is something we all share. When households take time to understand
  local flood risks and create an emergency plan, together we strengthen King County’s
  flood preparation.\n\nKing County Flood Control District Vice Chair Sarah Perry
  reflected on the shared responsibility of flood readiness: “The King County Flood
  Control District’s work is fundamentally about helping to protect lives and property,
  but we cannot do it alone. Flood preparedness requires partnership between the District
  and the residents of King County. When individuals and families take steps to prepare,
  they strengthen the flood resilience of our entire community.”\n\nFlood season is
  here, and now is the time to get prepared! Together, we can help reduce flood risks,
  protect our communities, and keep one another safe.\n\n## ![\U0001F449](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/1f449.png)
