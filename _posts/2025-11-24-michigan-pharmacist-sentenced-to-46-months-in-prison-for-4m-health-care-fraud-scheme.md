A former Michigan pharmacist, Nabil Fakih, was sentenced to 46 months in prison for his involvement in a health care fraud scheme that resulted in a loss of approximately $4 million to Medicare. In addition to his prison sentence, Fakih was ordered to pay $4 million in restitution and forfeit four real estate properties and $726,364.96. From 2011 to 2017, he billed Medicare for prescription medications that were never dispensed at his pharmacy in Dearborn Heights. Fakih submitted fraudulent claims for high-reimbursing medications, such as blood thinners and inhalers, despite not having the inventory to fulfill these claims. He concealed his fraudulent activities by manipulating inventory purchases and diverting the proceeds for personal benefit. In August 2024, Fakih pleaded guilty to one count of health care fraud in federal court. The investigation was conducted by the FBI and the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, with prosecution led by Trial Attorney Andres Q. Almendarez from the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section, which combats health care fraud through the Health Care Fraud Strike Force Program.
