Snoqualmie Valley Hospital has welcomed Dr. Jimmy Young, a specialist in neurology and epilepsy. Seizures, often a sign of epilepsy, occur when brain's electrical signals misfire, resulting in unusual movements, brief confusion, or loss of awareness. Epilepsy is the fourth most common neurological disorder, affecting 1 in 26 people during their lifetime. Dr. Young will provide personalized treatment plans including anti-seizure medications and potentially epilepsy surgery for those whose seizures are not controlled with medication alone. The hospital's expert epilepsy and seizure care allows patients to receive treatment close to home.
