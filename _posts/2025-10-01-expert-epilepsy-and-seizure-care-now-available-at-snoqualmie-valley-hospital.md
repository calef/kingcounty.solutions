  Seizures occur when the brain’s electrical signals misfire, leading to sudden changes such as unusual movements, brief confusion, or loss of awareness. While one seizure does not always mean a person has epilepsy, repeated seizures may signal the condition.

  Epilepsy is more common than many people realize. As the fourth most common neurological disorder, it affects one in 26 people during their lifetime. Because seizures can happen without warning, they can sometimes lead to injuries, cognitive impairment, or other complications. That’s why early diagnosis and treatment are so important. With the right care, many patients are able to reduce or even stop seizures, improving both safety and quality of life.

  #### **Meet Dr. Jimmy Young, Neurologist and Epileptologist**

  Snoqualmie Valley Hospital is proud to welcome Dr. Jimmy Young, MD, neurologist and epileptologist. Dr. Young trained locally at the University of Washington’s Harborview Medical Center and brings both advanced expertise and a community-focused approach to patient care.

  He believes that every seizure tells a story worth understanding. Through detailed evaluation, Dr. Young often identifies causes that are treatable—or even curable. For patients whose seizures are not controlled with medication alone, advanced treatment options such as epilepsy surgery may also be considered.

  #### **Personalized Treatment Plans**

  One of the most important steps in managing epilepsy is finding the right anti-seizure medication, also called an anti-epileptic drug (AED). With many options available, choosing the right medication can make a significant difference in controlling seizures while minimizing side effects.

  Dr. Young works closely with patients and families to create treatment plans tailored to each individual’s needs, goals, and lifestyle.

  #### **Specialized Care Close to Home**

  At Snoqualmie Valley Hospital, patients can feel confident knowing they have access to expert epilepsy and seizure care without having to travel far. Early evaluation can help prevent injuries, improve long-term outcomes, and provide peace of mind for patients and families.
