The HBO documentary "Surviving Ohio State" highlights the often-overlooked experiences of male survivors, particularly college-aged male athletes, in the context of sexual assault. The film emphasizes the need for a shift in narrative, showcasing how these athletes, usually perceived as perpetrators or bystanders, can also be victims. It raises critical questions about why their experiences were dismissed and how societal norms around masculinity contribute to this.

The documentary also explores the concept of power dynamics, illustrating how physical strength doesn't guarantee safety in vulnerable situations, such as medical examinations. It discusses the grooming patterns used by offenders, such as Dr. Richard Strauss, who exploited young, naïve athletes for his own gain. The importance of sexual health education is underscored, as many athletes lacked awareness of consent and grooming.

Additionally, the film critiques the failure of adults—coaches and administrators—to protect these students, highlighting systemic issues of silence and indifference in addressing sexual misconduct. It calls for meaningful conversations about vulnerability and support for male survivors, advocating for a cultural change that allows men to express their experiences without stigma. The documentary serves as a powerful reminder of the need to listen and advocate for all survivors.
