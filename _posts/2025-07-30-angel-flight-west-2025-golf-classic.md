Angel Flight West will host its 2025 Golf Classic at Monarch Beach Golf Links in Dana Point, California, on September 19, 2025. This annual charity tournament aims to raise funds to provide free flights for individuals requiring critical medical care. Participants can join as individual golfers or in teams and will have the chance to engage in various contests, auctions, and a helicopter golf ball drop. Executive Director Mary Hunter expressed excitement about the event's potential to connect supporters and impact the lives of patients. Last year's tournament raised $182,000, significantly aiding Angel Flight West's mission of delivering over 4,000 free flights annually to those in need. The organization has helped patients like Jonathan, who relies on these flights to access specialized care for brain cancer. This year's title sponsors are Gantry and Freshends, with additional support from various companies. Opportunities to participate include registering to play, donating auction items, volunteering, or attending the Cocktail Par-Tee. Angel Flight West has been providing free transportation for medical appointments for four decades, overcoming transportation barriers to healthcare in the Western United States.
