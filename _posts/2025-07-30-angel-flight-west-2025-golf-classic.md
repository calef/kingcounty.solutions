  <p><strong>Don’t Just Play Around. Play a Round That Matters.</strong> <br><em>Angel Flight West Announces 2025 Golf Classic at Monarch Beach Golf Links</em> </p>



  <p><strong>Dana Point, Calif. – September 19, 2025</strong> <br>The Angel Flight West Golf Classic is one of Southern California’s most exciting annual charity tournaments, offering multiple ways to participate and support a meaningful cause. Proceeds from the event help Angel Flight West arrange free flights for individuals in need of critical medical care, aligning with AFW’s mission of removing barriers to access for those most in need. </p>



  <p>Held at the breathtaking Monarch Beach Golf Links, the tournament is open to both individual golfers and foursomes. Attendees will enjoy a full day on the course complete with on-course contests like closest to the pin and longest drive, along with live and silent auctions, the fan-favorite helicopter golf ball drop, and a lively cocktail par-tee to close out the day.</p>



  <p>“We’re thrilled to bring our supporters together for a beautiful day of golf and connection at Monarch Beach Golf Links,” says Executive Director Mary Hunter. “The funds raised through this event truly impact the lives of the patients we serve. Every golfer, auction donor, sponsor, and volunteer play an essential role in advancing our mission.”&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Through a network of volunteer pilots and commercial airline partners, Angel Flight West provides more than 4,000 free flights each year to help patients access medical care and other essential services. Last year, the Golf Classic raised $182,000 to help make these life-changing missions possible.</p>



  <p>At the 2024 event, Jonathan — a patient who relies on Angel Flight West to reach vital care for brain cancer — shared, <em>“I wouldn’t have had access to any specialized care without Angel Flight West.” </em>Since 2021, Angel Flight West has gifted 88 flights to help Jonathan reach critical treatment at UCLA and UCSF.</p>



  <p>This year’s title sponsors are Gantry and Freshends. Other early sponsors include Ali Faddis, Starr Insurance Companies, Cerity Partners, One Three Right Studios, Lockton Companies, Califino, Cornerstone Escrow, and Capata CPA.</p>



  <p>There are many ways to get involved and make an impact. Register to play as an individual or foursome, donate an item to the silent auction, volunteer your time, or simply join us for the Cocktail Par-Tee to celebrate and support the cause. However you choose to participate, you’ll be helping Angel Flight West deliver hope and healing — one flight at a time.</p>

Angel Flight West will host its 2025 Golf Classic at Monarch Beach Golf Links in Dana Point, California, on September 19, 2025. This annual charity tournament aims to raise funds to provide free flights for individuals requiring critical medical care. Participants can join as individual golfers or in teams and will have the chance to engage in various contests, auctions, and a helicopter golf ball drop. Executive Director Mary Hunter expressed excitement about the event's potential to connect supporters and impact the lives of patients. Last year's tournament raised $182,000, significantly aiding Angel Flight West's mission of delivering over 4,000 free flights annually to those in need. The organization has helped patients like Jonathan, who relies on these flights to access specialized care for brain cancer. This year's title sponsors are Gantry and Freshends, with additional support from various companies. Opportunities to participate include registering to play, donating auction items, volunteering, or attending the Cocktail Par-Tee. Angel Flight West has been providing free transportation for medical appointments for four decades, overcoming transportation barriers to healthcare in the Western United States.
