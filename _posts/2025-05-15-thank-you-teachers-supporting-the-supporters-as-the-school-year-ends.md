As the school year concludes, gratitude is extended to teachers, counselors, and school staff for their significant contributions beyond academics. Their roles as mentors and supporters have a profound impact on students' lives, especially during challenging times. Many educators are feeling exhausted after navigating the demands of the school year, including testing and emotional support for students. Recognizing the importance of mental health, Ryther highlights the vital role teachers play in identifying and addressing student mental health needs.

A resource is offered for educators seeking to bolster their mental health awareness and support: MentalHealthInstruction.org. Developed by the SMART Center at the University of Washington, this free platform provides online training modules, classroom strategies for promoting emotional wellness, and guidance on connecting students with professional help. This resource is aimed at K-12 educators and is intended to enhance understanding of student needs while also supporting educators’ own mental wellness.

As summer approaches, Ryther encourages educators to take time to rest and recover, acknowledging their dedication to students and the critical role they play in fostering a supportive network for children's well-being.
