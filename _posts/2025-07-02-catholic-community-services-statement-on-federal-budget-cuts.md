  <p>We urge Congress to not abandon their constituents who will be impacted by the proposed cuts to Medicaid and other safety net programs, such as SNAP. The proposed cuts threaten health care and well-being for millions of Americans, especially for our neighbors who are seniors, disabled, sick, or children. Cutting SNAP would cause a crisis in food security for millions in America. The richest nation in the world should not have people starving. </p>



  <p><strong>This is not a partisan issue, but a call to duty to protect the people you serve. </strong></p>



  <p>It is wrong to extend tax cuts to corporations and the wealthiest Americans, only to make them richer while others suffer from the lack of healthcare, food security, housing, and live in poverty. Alarmingly, it also adds over&nbsp;$3.8 trillion to the national debt,&nbsp;further eroding the Nation’s ability to address future safety net support for millions of Americans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Congress, do not turn your back on the people you serve and who are counting on you!&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Jilma Meneses, the president and CEO of Catholic Community Services, the Archdiocesan Housing Authority, and the Catholic Charities Foundation sent a letter to our U.S. senators and U.S. representatives sharing this statement.</p>

Catholic Community Services has issued a statement urging Congress to reject proposed federal budget cuts to Medicaid and safety net programs like SNAP. These cuts threaten the health and well-being of millions, particularly vulnerable groups such as seniors, children, and individuals with disabilities. The organization highlights the potential crisis in food security that would arise from cutting SNAP, emphasizing that as a wealthy nation, the U.S. should not allow its citizens to experience hunger. The statement criticizes the extension of tax cuts to wealthy corporations while neglecting those in need of healthcare, food, and housing, warning that this approach could add over $3.8 trillion to the national debt. Jilma Meneses, president and CEO of Catholic Community Services, expressed the urgency of this issue in a letter to U.S. senators and representatives, urging them to fulfill their duty to protect their constituents. The organization advocates for prioritizing the needs of the most vulnerable populations rather than catering to the interests of the wealthy.
