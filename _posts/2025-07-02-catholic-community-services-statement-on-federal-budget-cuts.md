Catholic Community Services has issued a statement urging Congress to reject proposed federal budget cuts to Medicaid and safety net programs like SNAP. These cuts threaten the health and well-being of millions, particularly vulnerable groups such as seniors, children, and individuals with disabilities. The organization highlights the potential crisis in food security that would arise from cutting SNAP, emphasizing that as a wealthy nation, the U.S. should not allow its citizens to experience hunger. The statement criticizes the extension of tax cuts to wealthy corporations while neglecting those in need of healthcare, food, and housing, warning that this approach could add over $3.8 trillion to the national debt. Jilma Meneses, president and CEO of Catholic Community Services, expressed the urgency of this issue in a letter to U.S. senators and representatives, urging them to fulfill their duty to protect their constituents. The organization advocates for prioritizing the needs of the most vulnerable populations rather than catering to the interests of the wealthy.
