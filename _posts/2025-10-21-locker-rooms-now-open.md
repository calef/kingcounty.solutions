The Federal Way Community Center's newly renovated locker rooms officially reopened on October 22, following months of upgrades that began in February 2024. The renovations aim to enhance the member experience and modernize the facility. Key features of the updated locker rooms include durable epoxy flooring designed for heavy use, fresh tilework that creates a spa-like atmosphere, and upgraded fixtures such as sinks, mirrors, and lockers to improve functionality. The sauna and steam room have been completely rebuilt with new wood paneling and improved ventilation. Accessibility has been enhanced with the addition of a second shower near the leisure pool deck. New HVAC systems and ductwork have been installed for better airflow and humidity control, while waterproofing measures like cement board and sloped drains have been applied to ensure durability and ease of maintenance.
