The City of Bellevue has chosen four technology innovators to participate in its Civic Innovation Challenge, aimed at developing AI solutions for municipal challenges. The selected partners are Certivo, Legislaide, Juganu, and FindIt, each piloting projects that will be tested in real-world environments at the city or Bellevue College. Certivo offers an AI platform for real-time vendor compliance monitoring. Legislaide employs AI to simplify legislative research by analyzing municipal codes and state statutes. Juganu's smart lighting system aims to enhance transportation and safety by monitoring curbside activity. FindIt, created by a local student, is an AI solution for efficiently locating lost items on campus.

These participants will receive design partnerships, coaching from seasoned entrepreneurs, assistance from city staff, and a stipend of up to $15,000. They will showcase their solutions at the Innovation Exchange event on October 16. Additionally, Bellevue has adopted an updated AI policy to ensure the ethical and responsible use of AI in city operations, focusing on transparency, privacy, and community trust.
