topics: []
---

Bellevue’s Parks & Community Services Department has achieved a perfect reaccreditation score of 154 out of 154 from the national Commission for Accreditation of Park and Recreation Agencies (CAPRA). Michael Shiosaki, the department director, emphasized that this recognition reflects their commitment to delivering high-quality parks, services, and programs, noting the importance of understanding community needs. CAPRA reviewers assessed the department's dedication to equity, public engagement, program evaluation, and maintenance of parks and trails during a site visit last spring. Accreditation involves a rigorous process that includes application, self-assessment, and a final assessment by CAPRA. Bellevue has been accredited since 2005 and is the only department in Washington to achieve reaccreditation four times, ranking among just 222 accredited agencies nationwide. The department oversees an extensive network of 2,700 acres of parks and open spaces, including notable sites like Bellevue Downtown Park and the Bellevue Botanical Garden, with trails connecting from Lake Washington to Lake Sammamish.
