The Board of Commissioners for Public Hospital District No. 1 of King County, operating as Valley Medical Center, has adopted resolution No. 1066 regarding its regular property tax levy. If approved in November, Hospital Prop 1 would authorize a maximum property levy rate of $0.75 per $1,000 of assessed value for 2026, an increase of $0.46 from the current rate. This funding aims to enhance hospital and healthcare services, ensuring the availability of crucial services like labor and delivery, trauma, and emergency care 24/7. It also promotes local healthcare access, reducing stress and commute times for residents. Additionally, the proposition supports career development in South King County by providing competitive wages and opportunities for staff. Currently, only 2% of Valley Medical Center's revenue comes from property taxes, and the proposed increase in tax revenue is intended to stabilize the local healthcare system, allowing for continued high-quality care and job security in the community.
