  <p>The Board of Commissioners for Public Hospital District No. 1 of King County, dba Valley Medical Center, adopted resolution No. 1066 concerning the district’s regular property tax levy. If approved, this proposition would provide additional operating and capital funds for hospital and healthcare services. It authorizes a maximum regular property levy rate for collection in 2026 of $.75 per $1,000 of assessed value. This is a $.46 increase per $1,000 above the current amount. The 2026 levy amount will be used to compute the limitations for levies in subsequent years.</p>



  <p><strong>If passed in November, Hospital Prop 1 will:</strong></p>



  <ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li><strong>Secure the future of local care.</strong> Valley provides crucial hospital services 24 hours a day, including labor and delivery, trauma and emergency care, and intensive hospital care.</li>



  <li><strong>Keep care close to home. </strong>Get the care you need without leaving your neighborhood. Having excellent care just minutes away means less stress, shorter commute, and more time with the ones you love.</li>



  <li><strong>Build careers in South King County. </strong>The people at Valley are committed to the mission of caring for our community like family. It&#8217;s vital to provide stability and support them with competitive wages and opportunities to keep learning and growing with our community.</li>
  </ul>



  <p><strong>Did You Know?</strong></p>



  <p>Only 2% of Valley Medical Center revenue comes from property taxes, and we have worked very hard to keep the tax burden as low as possible. If passed, the increase in tax revenue would help stabilize our local healthcare system, allowing us to continue to provide great care for our community and great jobs for those who live and work in South King County.</p>

The Board of Commissioners for Public Hospital District No. 1 of King County, operating as Valley Medical Center, has adopted resolution No. 1066 regarding its regular property tax levy. If approved in November, Hospital Prop 1 would authorize a maximum property levy rate of $0.75 per $1,000 of assessed value for 2026, an increase of $0.46 from the current rate. This funding aims to enhance hospital and healthcare services, ensuring the availability of crucial services like labor and delivery, trauma, and emergency care 24/7. It also promotes local healthcare access, reducing stress and commute times for residents. Additionally, the proposition supports career development in South King County by providing competitive wages and opportunities for staff. Currently, only 2% of Valley Medical Center's revenue comes from property taxes, and the proposed increase in tax revenue is intended to stabilize the local healthcare system, allowing for continued high-quality care and job security in the community.
