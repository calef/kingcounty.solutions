Brian, a veteran who experienced homelessness for two years, found stability after moving into MSC’s Burien Veterans House. He faced numerous challenges, including significant debt and mental health issues, which made rebuilding his life seem impossible. Upon arriving at MSC, Brian needed more than just housing; he required advocacy and support. MSC staff successfully connected him with the HUD-VASH program, which provided him with permanent supportive housing, case management, and mental health services essential for his recovery. Now, Brian lives in a safe, stable home in a neighborhood that offers vital community resources. He expressed gratitude, stating, “With your help, I actually feel human again.” Brian’s journey highlights the importance of proper support in overcoming barriers to stability. MSC has also launched the Veterans Systems Navigation Program, which offers resources and assistance to homeless veterans, funded through the Veterans, Seniors, and Human Services Levy. This program complements existing initiatives like the William J. Wood Veterans House and Burien Veterans House, ensuring veterans have the necessary support to achieve their goals and find lasting stability.
