Weekend service adjustments for King County Metro include reroutes for several bus routes due to construction and events. Route 8 will be rerouted off E Denny Way from 1 a.m. to 11 a.m. on Saturday, October 25. Routes 255, 271, ST 542, and ST 545 will be affected by reroutes off the SR 520 floating bridge from Friday night until Saturday morning, and again from Saturday evening through early Monday. Additionally, routes 50, 128, and RapidRide C Line will be rerouted on Sunday due to The Harvest Fest, while multiple routes will be rerouted in the Montlake area during the Husky football game on Saturday afternoon. 

Transit options are available for those attending local sporting events, including the UW Huskies game at 12:30 p.m. and the Seattle Kraken game at 7 p.m. on Saturday. The Water Taxi is now operating on its winter schedule, and the Seattle Center Monorail will run on adjusted hours throughout the weekend. Riders are encouraged to use the Text for Departures service for real-time updates and sign up for alerts tailored to their preferred routes.
