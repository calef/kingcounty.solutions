  The community of Colville celebrated the opening of Dominican Sisters Haven (formerly known as Colville Family Haven) in September. This new Steven County housing community in rural in the northeast corner of the state, will offer 70 affordable units specifically designed for families with children, as well as two common area units and a clubhouse. &nbsp;

  Thirty-five of the units are reserved for households experiencing homelessness at the time of entry. The housing complex will feature a mix of bedroom sizes, including 24 one-bedroom units, 34 two-bedroom units, and 12 three-bedroom units.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  Potential residents need to make no more than 60% of the area median income (AMI), which allows this property to serve community members most in need.&nbsp;

  Dominican Sisters Haven was made possible thanks to a partnership between Catholic Charities of Eastern Washington (CCEW), Rural Resources Community Action and Spokane Housing Authority. It was funded by the State Housing Trust Fund and Washington State Housing Finance Commission.&nbsp;

  This property was built in response to documented scarcity of affordable housing in Colville, as verified by one of the region’s most involved affordable housing providers. [According to the Spokesman-Review](https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas-gov.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.spokesman.com.mcas-gov.ms%2Fstories%2F2025%2Fjul%2F05%2Fstevens-county-housing-project-opens-early-shelter%2F%3FMcasTsid%3D15600&McasCSRF=6662ea2cb013fb4ba8ca227a6715f19ad7c1e071e1b1a87c3029db646613a05a), CCEW commissioned a market study in 2020, which reported affordable housing vacancy levels in Colville to be at or below 1%, signifying the need for new development.&nbsp;
