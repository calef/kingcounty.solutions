PIM Savvy VITA has launched Certifying Acceptance Agent (CAA) services in Washington State, partnering with the IRS to assist alien individuals and foreign persons in obtaining Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers (ITIN). Recognizing the unique challenges faced by resilient populations, PIM Savvy aims to alleviate these burdens by offering free ITIN application and renewal services, along with complimentary tax preparation for qualifying individuals. The CAAs will ensure that the necessary documentation meets IRS criteria without requiring clients to mail proof of identity or foreign status to the IRS. PIM Savvy VITA prioritizes helping those in need and is committed to addressing the challenges faced by these communities. ITIN services are available at no cost in King County and Snohomish County through various VITA events, with appointments required for all CAA and ITIN services. Interested individuals can begin the appointment process through the PIM Savvy website, where they can also find a list of VITA events.
