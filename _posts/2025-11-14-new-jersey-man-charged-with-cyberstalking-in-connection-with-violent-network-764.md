Marek Cherkaoui, a 21-year-old from Egg Harbor Township, New Jersey, was arrested on charges of cyberstalking linked to a Nihilistic Violent Extremist (NVE) network known as 764. He was ordered detained following his initial appearance in the District of New Jersey. Court documents reveal that between December 2024 and May 2025, Cherkaoui allegedly threatened a minor female online, instructing her to self-harm, which she did on two occasions. He has a history of making violent threats and supporting mass shooters while soliciting child sexual abuse materials from minors. Law enforcement discovered explosives-related materials and tactical gear in a prior search of his home. During a recent search, FBI agents found writings indicating plans for murder and terrorism, including a strategy to join ISIS and return to the U.S. to commit attacks. The cyberstalking charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000, and supervised release. The investigation is being conducted by the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force, with support from the New Jersey State Police. The U.S. Attorney’s Office is prosecuting the case, emphasizing the dangers posed by NVE networks targeting vulnerable individuals.
