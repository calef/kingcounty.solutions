The City of Bellevue is celebrating National Drinking Water Week by highlighting the importance of safe, clean water and the infrastructure supporting it. To commemorate this occasion, a water-smart table will be set up at City Hall on May 7, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., where staff will provide information about Bellevue's drinking water sourced from the Cedar and South Fork Tolt rivers, alongside giveaways. Bellevue Utilities Director Lucy Liu emphasized the necessity of clean drinking water for health and quality of life, urging residents to appreciate the journey of water to their taps and to consider ways to protect this vital resource. Community members are encouraged to learn about the water supply system and explore local conservation tips to reduce water usage and safeguard resources.
