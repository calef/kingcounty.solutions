Next week, BrightSpark will celebrate Gratitude Week, a time to reflect on the successes made possible by their community of supporters. As the holiday season approaches, BrightSpark invites families, providers, partners, and advocates to join in this celebration. The organization emphasizes the importance of community support in helping families access quality early learning and providing essential resources to early learning providers. Throughout Gratitude Week, BrightSpark will share inspiring stories of impact and community on their social channels.

As the year draws to a close, BrightSpark encourages donations to maintain momentum in their mission. Contributions, whether one-time or recurring monthly donations, are essential for ensuring that families can access high-quality early learning and that providers are well-supported. The message expresses gratitude for the community's role in fostering joy and opportunity for children and families across King and Pierce Counties. The BrightSpark team, led by Hawa, an early learning provider, thanks supporters and invites them to consider joining the community of monthly donors, noting that even small contributions can have a significant impact.
