Asher, born prematurely at 25 weeks and weighing only 1 lb. 14 oz., has faced numerous health challenges, spending 164 days in the neonatal intensive care unit. Throughout his life, he has undergone multiple medical procedures, including a tracheotomy, a feeding device placement, and heart surgery. Now 11 years old, he has spent over 640 days in hospitals due to complications such as vocal cord paralysis, airway damage, and chronic lung disease. 

Asher's family has relied on Angel Flight West's volunteer pilots for transportation to critical care appointments at Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital Stanford, located more than 250 miles away. His mother, Charlene, expresses immense gratitude for the support, noting that the pilots have made a difficult journey significantly lighter. Asher, recognized as an unsung hero by his local county for his positive attitude, enjoys playing soccer and has developed a love for flying, thanks to the kindness of the pilots. Charlene acknowledges the compassion of the Angel Flight West pilots, highlighting their impact on families facing complex medical situations. She recently shared a heartfelt letter of thanks to the organization.
