  <p>Weighing only 1 lb. 14 oz, Asher was born prematurely at 25 weeks. He spent 164 days in the neonatal intensive care unit and had to have a tracheotomy at just three months old. At four months, Asher had a button—a feeding device—placed in his stomach. And at 22 months, he underwent heart surgery.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Now 11 years old, Asher has spent more than 640 days in the hospital. “Over 11 years and four different states, it’s been a long, difficult journey that we navigate daily—and will continue to navigate for many more years—a journey made immeasurably lighter by the unwavering support of Angel Flight West,” says Asher’s mom, Charlene.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Multiple intubations during Asher’s time in the NICU resulted in vocal cord paralysis and airway damage. And a severe case of pneumonia caused his lungs to not fully develop, leading to chronic lung disease. As his case became more complex, Asher was referred to Lucile Packard Children&#8217;s Hospital Stanford, more than 250 miles from home, where he’s had five surgeries since October 2024 to try to rebuild his airways.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Angel Flight West’s volunteer pilots have been flying the family to Asher’s critical care appointments since their first visit to Stanford, landing at Palo Alto Airport. “This organization is truly lifesaving for families going through complex medical situations,” Charlene says. “It’s beautiful, the relief the pilots bring.”  </p>



  <p>As for Asher? Charlene says he’s a happy boy with a great attitude, recently honored by their local county as an unsung hero for his positive behavior. He loves playing soccer, spending time with his older brother Landon—and now, flying.</p>

  <p>Charlene is quick to name the volunteer pilots who have made their journey to Asher’s care easier—Nello Franco, David Burke, Jim Gruneisen, and their first volunteer pilot Stefan Schaeuble, who let Asher sit up front to “help fly the plane.”&nbsp;</p>



  <p>“It’s heartwarming to see people who actually care,” says Charlene. “That’s what has touched me the most. AFW pilots are the kindest people in the world.”&nbsp;</p>
