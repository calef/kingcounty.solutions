The City of Bellevue is hosting an open house on November 20 from 6 to 8 p.m. at City Hall to present the preliminary Diversity Advantage Plan 2035. This event, organized with the Centering Communities of Color Coordination Team, will cover the plan update process, community feedback integration, and implementation strategies. Dinner and activities for children will be available, and preregistration is required. The original Diversity Advantage Plan was adopted in 2014, featuring 60 recommendations aimed at enhancing diversity, inclusivity, and equity within the community. Between 2023 and 2024, city staff engaged with residents to gather input for the plan update, ensuring it addresses the evolving needs of the community. The updated plan envisions collaboration between the city and community members to foster diversity, equity, inclusion, and a sense of belonging, ultimately enhancing the quality of life for all residents. For those requiring alternate formats or accommodations, the city offers assistance with prior notice.
