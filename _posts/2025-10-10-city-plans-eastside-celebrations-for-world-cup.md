The City of Bellevue is preparing for significant celebrations along the 2 Line corridor during the World Cup in Seattle next summer. To facilitate this, a meeting is scheduled for October 22, where businesses, cultural organizations, and local artists can learn about grants available for World Cup-themed events. These activations will occur on six match days in June and July 2026, coinciding with Seattle's games. The Bellevue Downtown Association and Visit Bellevue Washington will provide financial support for these initiatives. The city encourages creative, inclusive, and globally inspired ideas that enhance the experience of both community members and visitors, whether they are heading to the games or not. The October 22 meeting will include discussions with city staff and community partners about the activation timeline and funding opportunities, followed by a soccer-themed mixer for attendees to share ideas for World Cup celebrations.
