Caregiving can lead to significant burnout, as highlighted by Betsy Fitzgerald, a care partner for a lung transplant survivor. She likens her journey to Kintsugi, the Japanese art of repairing broken pottery, emphasizing the importance of self-care amidst caregiving challenges. Caregivers often face overwhelming responsibilities, including managing appointments and providing emotional support, which can result in physical symptoms such as fatigue, headaches, and high blood pressure. Recognizing and addressing caregiver stress is crucial, as unchecked burnout can have serious health implications. 

To combat stress, caregivers are encouraged to seek help, utilize relaxation techniques, and incorporate physical activity into their routines. Finding time for personal interests and staying connected with loved ones is essential for re-energizing. Additionally, caregivers should remain educated about the evolving needs of those they care for, especially in cases like dementia. Overall, prioritizing self-care and seeking support can help caregivers mend their own lives while effectively caring for others.
