The Board of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery has suspended the license of Spokane County physician Mark Hart due to his inability to practice medicine safely. This action follows allegations that Hart did not complete a required substance use disorder treatment program after a 2023 DUI conviction. The suspension is intended to protect patient safety and public health. Hart has 20 days to request a hearing to contest the charges. The Department of Health encourages reporting any unprofessional conduct by healthcare providers.
