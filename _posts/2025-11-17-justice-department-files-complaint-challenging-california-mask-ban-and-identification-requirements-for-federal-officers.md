The Department of Justice has filed a lawsuit against California and its officials, including Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Robert Bonta, challenging the constitutionality of the "No Secret Police Act" and "No Vigilantes Act." The lawsuit argues that these laws are discriminatory actions against federal law enforcement and pose significant safety threats to federal officers, who have experienced increased harassment, doxxing, and violence. According to Attorney General Pamela Bondi, these laws unjustly penalize officers for protecting their identities and families, undermining federal law enforcement operations. Assistant Attorney General Brett A. Shumate emphasized the Department's commitment to safeguarding law enforcement privacy and safety against unconstitutional state laws. The lawsuit follows a rise in assaults against federal agents, which officials attribute to politically charged rhetoric that undermines their legitimacy. The Department of Justice aims to identify and challenge state and local laws that obstruct federal operations, with this lawsuit being part of broader efforts that include actions against similar policies in states like New York and New Jersey.
