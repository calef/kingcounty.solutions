The Housing Washington 2025 Conference, held on September 29-30 in Bellevue, WA, gathered housing advocates, developers, policymakers, and service providers to discuss affordable housing's future. The event featured keynote speakers Brian Goldstone and Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, who addressed the systemic issues contributing to housing insecurity. Attendees engaged in breakout sessions covering various topics, including advocacy, homeownership, and strategies to combat homelessness. Workshops and "Learning Labs" provided practical tools for implementing fair housing policies and strengthening community development efforts.

A key takeaway from the conference was the urgent need for collaboration across sectors and equitable policy solutions to ensure affordable housing access for all Washington residents. The next conference is scheduled for Spokane on October 20-22, 2026, with plans for more team involvement. The experience left attendees like Rose M., a housing advocate, feeling inspired and motivated to continue the legacy of housing activism.
