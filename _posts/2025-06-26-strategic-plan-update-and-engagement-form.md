Friends of Youth has gathered significant insights from its recent Community Feedback Survey, which aimed to understand the needs of youth, young adults, and families. The survey highlighted urgent needs including expanded mental and behavioral health services, affordable housing, quality education, community involvement, job training opportunities, basic needs support, and mentorship from caring adults. Respondents identified essential resources for making a positive impact, such as sustainable funding, well-trained staff, active volunteer support, engaging cultural programs, comprehensive services, and a network of dedicated mentors. This input is crucial as Friends of Youth moves forward with its strategic planning process, helping define priorities and set meaningful goals for the next three years. The organization emphasizes that this collaborative effort will enhance its responsiveness and connection to the community it serves. As Friends of Youth continues this journey, they express gratitude for the partnership and support from the community.
