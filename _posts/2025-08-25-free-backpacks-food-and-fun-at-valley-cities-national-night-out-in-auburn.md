Valley Cities Behavioral Health Care is hosting a National Night Out event on August 5 in Auburn, Washington, from 3 to 6 p.m. at 915 26th St NE. This community gathering aims to promote connection and support, featuring free backpacks and school supplies for children, along with family-friendly activities, music, and light refreshments. The event is a collaborative effort among Valley Cities’ clinics in Auburn, Kent, and Federal Way. Local organizations will provide resources related to mental health, housing, youth programs, and primary care. Payton Standfill, Marketing Specialist at Valley Cities, emphasizes the importance of supporting families during the back-to-school season and creating a welcoming environment. National Night Out traditionally strengthens community ties and enhances safety. The event not only offers fun but also connects attendees with valuable services, alleviating some of the pressures families face at this time of year.
