DAV supports the ASSIST Act of 2025, aimed at modernizing the Department of Veterans Affairs' Automobile Adaptive Equipment (AAE) program for service-disabled veterans. Established in 1946, the AAE program currently has a limited list of adaptive equipment that does not reflect modern technology, restricting veterans' access to necessary vehicle modifications. The ASSIST Act seeks to expand the definition of “medical services,” allowing the VA to cover a wider range of medically required modifications, such as ramp systems, mobility lifts, and modified seating. Senator Tommy Tuberville, who sponsors the bill, emphasizes the importance of safe and independent travel for veterans, highlighting that many struggle to operate vehicles without appropriate modifications. The bill has already passed the House and is under consideration by the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs. DAV National Commander Coleman Nee asserts that all service-disabled veterans deserve reliable transportation to maintain their independence and remain active in their communities. The legislation aims to ensure that the AAE program evolves with technological advancements to meet the diverse needs of disabled veterans effectively.
