Dr. Megan Beers has been appointed as the new Chief Program Officer of Boyer Children’s Clinic following a comprehensive national search. Joining the team in late May, Megan brings over 17 years of leadership experience in early childhood systems of care. As a licensed clinical psychologist, she has a strong background in organizational transformation and the development of trauma-informed, equity-centered frameworks that benefit young children and families. Her previous executive roles include positions at Childhaven and Wellspring Family Services, and she most recently served as a Senior Consultant at Health Management Associates.

Megan expresses her admiration for Boyer’s mission and looks forward to collaborating with the dedicated staff and partners to expand the clinic's impact. Her strategic and compassionate leadership style aligns with the organization’s values, and her experience is already proving to be a valuable asset as Boyer continues to grow its programs and partnerships.
