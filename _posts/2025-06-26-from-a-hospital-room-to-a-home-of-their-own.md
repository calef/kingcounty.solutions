Jane and her family, who immigrated to the United States over ten years ago, faced a life-altering challenge when her daughter required a bone marrow transplant, necessitating a move to Seattle for treatment. This transition, initially intended to be temporary, turned into a months-long struggle, leading to Jane's eviction from their home in the Tri-Cities due to missed rent payments. In Seattle, Jane found herself without a home, income, or support, while caring for her ailing child. Fortunately, Seattle Children’s Hospital provided temporary accommodation at the Ronald McDonald House, where Jane connected with the Mary’s Place outreach team. They assisted her in exploring employment options, income planning, and shelter needs. Jane ultimately qualified for affordable housing, but her rental debt from the Tri-Cities posed a barrier. Thanks to generous donations, Mary’s Place paid off this debt, enabling the family to secure a new home. Today, Jane and her daughter are safe and stable, finally building a new life together after overcoming significant hardships.
