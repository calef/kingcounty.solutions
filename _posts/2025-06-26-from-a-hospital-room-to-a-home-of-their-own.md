Life was good. Jane’s family was thriving, building community, and living their version of the American Dream.&nbsp;

  Then everything changed.&nbsp;

  Jane’s daughter started experiencing serious health issues, and doctors said she needed a bone marrow transplant. The best care was in Seattle. So, without hesitation, Jane packed up her young children and moved across the state so her daughter could get the life-saving treatment she needed at Seattle Children’s Hospital.&nbsp;

  Thankfully, Seattle Children’s helped the family with a temporary stay at the Ronald McDonald House. That’s when they were introduced to the Mary’s Place outreach team.&nbsp;

  Knowing her daughter’s treatment was almost complete and their temporary stay at the Ronald McDonald House would soon end, our outreach team hit the ground running. Mary’s Place Outreach Coordinator, Keianna, checked in with Jane several times a week to talk through her employment options, income plans, and potential shelter needs.

However, thanks to the support of our donors, Mary’s Place was able to pay off that debt and open the door to a brand-new home for the family.

  Today, Jane and her daughter are safe, stable, and settling into their new life. They’ve come so far—and they’re finally home.&nbsp;

Jane and her family, who immigrated to the United States over ten years ago, faced a life-altering challenge when her daughter required a bone marrow transplant, necessitating a move to Seattle for treatment. This transition, initially intended to be temporary, turned into a months-long struggle, leading to Jane's eviction from their home in the Tri-Cities due to missed rent payments. In Seattle, Jane found herself without a home, income, or support, while caring for her ailing child. Fortunately, Seattle Children’s Hospital provided temporary accommodation at the Ronald McDonald House, where Jane connected with the Mary’s Place outreach team. They assisted her in exploring employment options, income planning, and shelter needs. Jane ultimately qualified for affordable housing, but her rental debt from the Tri-Cities posed a barrier. Thanks to generous donations, Mary’s Place paid off this debt, enabling the family to secure a new home. Today, Jane and her daughter are safe and stable, finally building a new life together after overcoming significant hardships.
