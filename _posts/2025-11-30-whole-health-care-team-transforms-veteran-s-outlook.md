  <p>Every so often, we all need some encouragement—a pat on the back, a warm smile; a trusted, healthy source of comfort or inspiration—we can turn to during life’s trying moments. For Air Force Veteran Andre Long, he found that and more in VA health care and Whole Health.</p>

  ## Veteran finds that and more in VA health care

  Every so often, we all need some encouragement—a pat on the back, a warm smile; a trusted, healthy source of comfort or inspiration—we can turn to during life’s trying moments. For Air Force Veteran Andre Long, he found that and more in VA health care and Whole Health.

  Grappling with a recent cancer diagnosis and everyday life stresses, Long was struggling to juggle the massive life-changing news and all the emotions that it brought.&nbsp;

  Realizing he needed help to take on this new battle, Long was paired with three Salisbury VA Health Care System&nbsp;care teams that assisted in changing his outlook and helped him re-inspire hope and positivity.&nbsp;

  “I just knew I had to do something because I felt like the old me, that black cloud was returning,” said Long. “I didn’t like that feeling. So, I reached out for help.”

  ## A union of skills & services

  This past spring, Long was paired with Heather Todd, a social worker and therapist with Primary Care Mental Health Integration (PCMHI); Martin Harper, a peer support specialist with Mental Health & Behavioral Sciences; and Dr. Meghan Cody, a psychologist with [Whole Health](https://news.va.gov/?s=Whole+Health+) at the Kernersville Health Care Center (HCC).&nbsp;

  Peer specialists are trained and certified mental health care professionals and Veterans. They have personal experience with recovery from a mental health condition. They are part of interdisciplinary treatment teams, like Long’s own care team.&nbsp;

  “We want Veterans to realize that real change comes with a lifestyle change,” said Harper, an Air Force Veteran who has served as a peer specialist in PCMHI for over four years in Kernersville. “It comes with retooling your thinking; self-care and self-directed care are really big.”

  PCMHI is a bridge service that connects Veterans who are interested in same-day mental health appointments and crisis visits with specialists.

  After a consultation, the service helps Veterans receive assistance through primary care mental health, the mental health clinic or care in the community.

  “We’re trying to give Veterans practical tools to put in the toolbox, which is part of why I think it works so well for them; it gives people a chance to connect with other individuals who are going through similar situations,” said Dr. Cody, whose sessions (individual and group) are tailored to the Veteran’s Whole Health.

The Whole Health team at the VA has successfully transformed the outlook of veterans by focusing on holistic care. This approach emphasizes the importance of mental, physical, and emotional well-being, moving beyond traditional medical treatments. Veterans participate in a range of personalized programs that include mindfulness, yoga, and nutrition, which foster a sense of empowerment and self-management in their health journeys.

One veteran who had struggled with chronic pain and depression found renewed hope and purpose through the Whole Health program. By engaging in activities that promote well-being, he has experienced significant improvements in his quality of life. The program encourages veterans to set their own health goals, providing them with tools and support to achieve these objectives.

The Whole Health model has been shown to enhance resilience and increase the overall satisfaction of veterans with their healthcare experiences. As the initiative continues to grow, it aims to reach more veterans, offering them a comprehensive path to health that integrates various aspects of their lives. This shift toward a more inclusive approach to care exemplifies the VA's commitment to improving the health and well-being of those who have served the nation.
