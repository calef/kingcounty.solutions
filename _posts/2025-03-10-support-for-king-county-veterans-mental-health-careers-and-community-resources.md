  &nbsp;

  Every veteran’s journey is unique, but for many, the transition from military to civilian life comes with unexpected challenges.

  Of the estimated 127,000 veterans who call King County home, approximately 20,000 have experienced post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI) or military sexual trauma (MST).

  Despite the need for support, national trends suggest that another 12,000 veterans in the region hesitate to seek help on their own.

  While the weight of these struggles leads to homelessness, poverty and/or unemployment, one King County organization is working to change that.

  [Valley Cities Behavioral Health&nbsp;](https://valleycities.org/service/military-veterans-services/)[Care](https://valleycities.org/service/military-veterans-services/), particularly the&nbsp;[Steven A. Cohen Military Family Clinic at Valley&nbsp;](https://cohen.valleycities.org/)[Cities](https://cohen.valleycities.org/), provides essential services to help veterans rebuild their lives and rediscover their sense of purpose.

  **A lifeline for veterans and their families**

  At the Cohen Clinic, veterans and their families find a safe, supportive space where they can access tailored mental health services:

  - **Therapy services –** &nbsp;Individual, couples and family therapy using evidence-based practices to address behavioral health challenges.
  - **Group therapy –** &nbsp;Various therapy and non-therapy groups for children and adults, offered as openings become available.
  - **Medication management –** &nbsp;Short-term medication support for mental health and substance use disorders, including depression, anxiety and PTSD.
  - **Case management –** &nbsp;Collaborative assistance to help veterans address diverse needs beyond therapy, ensuring holistic support.

  “Our veterans sacrificed so much to protect others, and the least we can do is ensure they receive proper care and support when they need it most,” says Jacqueline Scott Howard, a recruiter at Valley Cities.

  **More than just support**

  For many veterans, healing goes beyond mental health care – it includes finding stability and a renewed sense of purpose through employment. Valley Cities actively prepares veterans for careers, not just in the broader workforce but within the organization itself.

  “Not only do we assist veterans in finding employment with other organizations and businesses in their communities, we also provide opportunities within our own organization,” Scott Howard says. “By first ensuring they receive the support, training and high-quality, trauma-informed care they need, we can then employ many of the veterans we help, allowing them to assist us in supporting future veterans in need.”

  **Connecting Veterans to new opportunities**

  For those ready to take the next step in their careers, Valley Cities is participating in the coming&nbsp;[RecruitMilitary Job Fair](https://my.recruitmilitary.com/events/job-fair-at-joint-base-lewis-mcchord-march-27-2025?fbclid=IwY2xjawI7FZRleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHapRNFZaKzD3hWGsghD_TUFgtdkv1fFhWVHSz9CRGIoNUX5PKOs_y8JJow_aem_z6y7EjdfBKhw3cSugGoZcw)&nbsp;at the American Lake Conference Center at Fort Lewis.

Support for veterans in King County focuses on mental health, career opportunities, and community resources. An estimated 127,000 veterans reside in the area, with around 20,000 having faced PTSD, TBI, or MST. Many veterans hesitate to seek help, resulting in increased risks of homelessness and unemployment. Valley Cities Behavioral Health Care, particularly through the Steven A. Cohen Military Family Clinic, offers vital mental health services, including individual and group therapy, medication management, and case management aimed at holistic support.

Valley Cities also emphasizes career readiness, providing veterans with opportunities for employment within their organization and in the broader community. A key event for veterans is the RecruitMilitary Job Fair on March 27, 2025, at Fort Lewis, which connects them with various employers. The organization’s Veteran Outreach Pathfinders, who are veterans themselves, build trust and provide support to those in crisis, ensuring they feel understood and supported. Valley Cities is committed to helping veterans and their families find paths to recovery and success, encouraging those in need to reach out for assistance. Contributions to Valley Cities are welcomed to help sustain their essential services.
