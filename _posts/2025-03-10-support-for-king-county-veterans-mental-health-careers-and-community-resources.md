Support for veterans in King County focuses on mental health, career opportunities, and community resources. An estimated 127,000 veterans reside in the area, with around 20,000 having faced PTSD, TBI, or MST. Many veterans hesitate to seek help, resulting in increased risks of homelessness and unemployment. Valley Cities Behavioral Health Care, particularly through the Steven A. Cohen Military Family Clinic, offers vital mental health services, including individual and group therapy, medication management, and case management aimed at holistic support.

Valley Cities also emphasizes career readiness, providing veterans with opportunities for employment within their organization and in the broader community. A key event for veterans is the RecruitMilitary Job Fair on March 27, 2025, at Fort Lewis, which connects them with various employers. The organization’s Veteran Outreach Pathfinders, who are veterans themselves, build trust and provide support to those in crisis, ensuring they feel understood and supported. Valley Cities is committed to helping veterans and their families find paths to recovery and success, encouraging those in need to reach out for assistance. Contributions to Valley Cities are welcomed to help sustain their essential services.
