  <h2><strong>Turning Points That Change Lives</strong></h2>
  <p>Karen Lee is the kind of person who lights up a room and often fills it, too. Whether she’s entertaining close friends or planning the next great party, her warmth and generosity extend far beyond her social circle. A proud grandmother, frequent traveler, and devoted dog mom to her miniature long-haired dachshund Theodora, Karen lives a vibrant life rooted in connection.</p>
  <p>But behind her joyful presence is a deep commitment to making a difference for youth and families facing hard times.</p>
  <p><strong>From a Breakfast Table to a Deep Commitment</strong></p>
  <p>Karen’s relationship with Youth Eastside Services (YES) began more than a decade ago, when a former colleague at Costco introduced her. She attended her first <span style="color: #ff6600;"><a style="color: #ff6600;" href="https://youtu.be/MA97TqF0BIc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Invest in Youth Breakfast</a></span> in 2012 and was forever changed by what she heard.</p>
  <blockquote><p>“I remember being brought to tears,” she said. “The kids’ stories are just so courageous. Every year, someone’s story touches me deeply. And the staff, the counselors, therapists, and cheerleaders, what they do is incredible.”</p></blockquote>
  <p>Karen quickly stepped up as a Table Host the following year, a role she cherished.</p>
  <p><strong>A Personal Connection to Mental Health</strong></p>
  <p>Karen&#8217;s commitment to YES is rooted not just in empathy, but in personal experience. Reflecting on a family member’s struggles with mental health, abuse, and homelessness was highly impactful to Karen.</p>
  <blockquote><p>“Watching her go through that was heartbreaking. But it also made me realize how critical it is to support organizations like YES that are there when families are out of options.”</p></blockquote>
  <p><strong>Looking Ahead, Giving Back</strong></p>
  <p>For Karen, the importance of giving to youth mental health comes down to one thing: hope for a better future.</p>
  <blockquote><p>“These are our future leaders,” she said. “In society, in politics, in families. If their families aren’t equipped to help, then we need to step in.”</p></blockquote>
  <p>Her generosity stems from her belief that each young person, when given the proper support and resources, holds incredible potential. She fondly remembers the life-changing opportunity she had as a teenager to study abroad in Germany. There, she learned her capacity for growth and resilience, even when things were hard.</p>
  <blockquote><p>“I went through quite a rough patch myself as a teen,” she shared. “But spending a year in Germany when I was 16 completely changed my perspective. It showed me that growth is possible, that life can look different on the other side of struggle.”</p></blockquote>
  <p>That experience left a lasting impression, and today, Karen gives so that others can find their own turning points too.</p>
  <p><strong>A Lasting Legacy of Compassion</strong></p>
  <p>Karen’s ongoing support of YES is grounded in her belief that no one gets through life alone and that with care, community, and courage, every young person has the potential to thrive.</p>
  <blockquote><p>“I give because I believe in what YES does. I believe in the youth they serve,” she said. “And I believe in a future where all kids get the chance to heal and be seen.”</p></blockquote>

Karen Lee, a vibrant individual known for her warmth and generosity, has been deeply committed to supporting youth and families through Youth Eastside Services (YES) for over a decade. Her journey began after attending the Invest in Youth Breakfast in 2012, where she was profoundly moved by the courageous stories of young people. This experience inspired her to become a Table Host, allowing her to engage more actively with the organization.

Karen's dedication is personal; she reflects on a family member's struggles with mental health and homelessness, which highlighted the importance of organizations like YES. She believes in the potential of every young person and emphasizes the need to support them when their families cannot. Her own transformative experience studying abroad in Germany as a teenager taught her about resilience and growth, shaping her perspective on life's challenges.

Karen's ongoing support of YES is rooted in her belief that no one navigates life alone. She advocates for a future where all children have the opportunity to heal and thrive, encouraging others to contribute to this mission, whether through small or significant donations, including monthly support for consistent impact.
