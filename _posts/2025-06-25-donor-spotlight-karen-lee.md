Karen Lee, a vibrant individual known for her warmth and generosity, has been deeply committed to supporting youth and families through Youth Eastside Services (YES) for over a decade. Her journey began after attending the Invest in Youth Breakfast in 2012, where she was profoundly moved by the courageous stories of young people. This experience inspired her to become a Table Host, allowing her to engage more actively with the organization.

Karen's dedication is personal; she reflects on a family member's struggles with mental health and homelessness, which highlighted the importance of organizations like YES. She believes in the potential of every young person and emphasizes the need to support them when their families cannot. Her own transformative experience studying abroad in Germany as a teenager taught her about resilience and growth, shaping her perspective on life's challenges.

Karen's ongoing support of YES is rooted in her belief that no one navigates life alone. She advocates for a future where all children have the opportunity to heal and thrive, encouraging others to contribute to this mission, whether through small or significant donations, including monthly support for consistent impact.
