Grace Tissell has joined the Inatai Foundation as Human Resources Operations Manager, bringing with her a strong commitment to racial justice and equity. With a background in sociology, she has previously worked to support first-generation college students and foster inclusion in tech, making her transition to Human Resources a natural fit. Grace is inspired by Inatai's mission, which aligns with her values of advocating for justice and promoting community voices. She emphasizes the importance of unity and intentional connection in transforming communities, expressing hope for a future built on healing and peace. Grace identifies as empathetic, intentional, and grounded, and belongs to communities that prioritize mental health and lifelong learning. She enjoys Washington's natural beauty, particularly the Evergreen state's mountains and green trees, with Kirby Billingsley Hydro Park being her favorite local spot. In her free time, Grace cherishes creating spaces for connection, whether with her husband, their dogs, or through cozy gatherings with friends. She recommends "The Five Dysfunctions of a Team" by Patrick Lencioni for its insights into building trust and accountability in teams.
