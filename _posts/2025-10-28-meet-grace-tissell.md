  Tissell<br /><strong>Pronouns:</strong>  she/her<br /><strong>Role: </strong> Human

  What are three words that describe you?</strong></p>\n<p>Empathetic, intentional,
  and grounded.</p>\n<p><strong>2. What is the “long story short” of how you landed
  at Inatai?</strong></p>\n<p>I’ve always been drawn to understanding systems and
  advocating for those most impacted by injustice. With a background in sociology
  and a heart for racial justice and equity, I’ve worked in spaces centered on belonging—from
  supporting first-generation college students to facilitating inclusion in tech.
  Human Resources felt like a natural extension. When I found Inatai, it felt like
  everything I care about—racial justice, people-centered work, and learning—aligned.
  I remember thinking, “This is the kind of place I didn’t know I was allowed to hope
  for.” Now I’m here—eager, inspired, and ready to begin.</p>\n<p><strong>3. What
  excites you most about being part of Team Inatai?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m most excited
  to be part of a team that doesn’t just talk about racial justice, but tries to live
  it. Being at Inatai means contributing to a mission that aligns with my core values
  and working alongside people who are committed to transformative change. I’m eager
  to help build systems that center equity, uplift community voices, and create space
  for people to thrive.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Tell us about the community or communities
  you belong to.</strong></p>\n<p>I belong to communities rooted in intentional living
  and growth. As a DINKWAD—dual income, no kids, with dogs—I prioritize mental health,
  career focus, and animals as family. I’m also a lifelong learner, pursuing education
  while working full time. These communities reflect my values of peace, presence,
  and creating space for people to thrive.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Inatai’s strategies
  are underlined by a 50-Year Vision informed by communities. What is it about your
  community that keeps you hopeful for the future?</strong></p>\n<p>There’s power
  in unity. In a time when isolation is easy, I find hope in people coming together
  around shared purpose. Intentional connection and community spark transformation—and
  I believe we can shape a future rooted in healing, peace, and change when we show
  up for each other.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Finish this sentence: The Inatai value the
  most resonates with me is&#8230;</strong></p>\n<p>Joy</p>\n<p><strong>7. What is
  your favorite fact about Washington?</strong></p>\n<p>I love that Washington is
  the Evergreen state. After having lived in other states, it’s amazing to come back
  to Washington and be surrounded by mountains and green trees – there&#8217;s no
  better feeling than being able to call this beautiful state my home.</p>\n<p><strong>8.
  Where is your favorite place in Washington?</strong></p>\n<p>Kirby Billingsley Hydro
  Park in East Wenatchee is my favorite spot in Washington. I love walking my dogs
  along the Columbia River trail, letting them splash in the water, dipping my toes
  in on hot days, and playing pickleball at the public courts.</p>\n<p><strong>9.
  What is the last thing you read, watched, or listened to that you would recommend?
  Why?</strong></p>\n<p>I’d recommend &#8220;The Five Dysfunctions of a Team&#8221;
  by Patrick Lencioni. It’s a practical, accessible read that offers valuable insights
  into building trust and accountability. As someone in HR who centers equity, I found
  it especially helpful for fostering inclusive, high-functioning teams.</p>\n<p><strong>10.
  What do you like to do when you’re not at work?</strong></p>\n<p>I find joy in creating
  spaces of comfort and connection—whether that’s quiet time with my husband, and
  our two rough collies, Penny and Ruby, or sharing cozy moments with loved ones over
  puzzles or games, warm drinks, and good conversation. Those simple, grounding moments
  mean the most to me.</p></div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>"
