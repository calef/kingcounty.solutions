The Bellevue City Council unanimously approved a $600,000 allocation from its contingency fund to assist organizations providing legal aid for immigrants and refugees, along with urgent food and financial support. This decision follows community requests during a public hearing concerning the 2025-2026 budget adjustments. The funding will be distributed equally among the three areas of assistance, complementing an earlier $235,000 approved for immediate food aid. 

Additionally, the council reviewed updates to the Critical Areas Ordinance, aimed at enhancing environmental protections in line with state law. These changes include modernizing rules and providing flexibility for land restoration while balancing growth. 

A proposed amendment to the city’s land use code was also discussed, which would permit co-living housing in designated areas per state law. This type of housing features private living spaces with shared kitchen facilities. A public hearing for this amendment is scheduled for December 2. 

Lastly, the council issued a proclamation for Transgender Awareness Week and Transgender Day of Remembrance, highlighting its commitment to inclusivity and support for the transgender community.
