  Plus, discussion about critical areas ordinance, co-living housing and transgender awareness proclamation

  In response to increasing community need, the City Council voted unanimously Wednesday to invest $600,000 from its contingency for organizations providing immigrant and refugee legal assistance and urgent food and financial support.

  The resources, to be divided equally among the three kinds of assistance (food, financial and legal), will be directed to multiple agencies who have current contracts through the city’s human services funding. This adds to the $235,000 the city manager [recently approved](https://bellevuewa.gov/city-news/city-takes-action-address-immediate-nutrition-needs-community "City takes action to address immediate nutrition needs in community") from the city’s operating budget for immediate food assistance in the community.

  The decision to draw from the contingency came following a public hearing concerning adjustments for the second year of the city’s 2025-2026 biennial budget and capital improvement program. Several community members spoke and sent letters asking the council to address the mounting needs in the community. The council had previously drawn $1 million from the $2 million contingency for urgent community needs during this biennium. &nbsp;

  While staff will immediately begin directing the $600,000 to human service agencies, the final mid-biennial budget legislation is being prepared for action at the Nov.18 meeting. Details on the proposed adjustments and potential implications of the current economic outlook were discussed at the [Oct. 28 meeting](https://bellevue.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7713740&GUID=A5801AE8-885E-47D5-80C4-CB7D2BF74E45).&nbsp;

  Updates to critical areas ordinance reviewed

  In other business, the council reviewed the Planning Commission’s recommendation to update the city’s Critical Areas Ordinance. Critical areas are natural features protected under Washington’s Growth Management Act, including streams, wetlands, frequently flooded areas, steep slopes and groundwater resources. As part of the update required under state law, the recommendation includes proposed changes to how the city’s most sensitive environmental areas are protected.&nbsp;

  These updates are designed to reflect current science, meet state standards and balance the city’s growth with environmental protection. The update also modernizes outdated rules and offers more flexibility for restoring disturbed land and degraded areas, making it easier for property owners to protect the environment while supporting responsible growth.&nbsp;

The proposed ordinance and supporting materials are available in the [meeting materials](https://bellevue.legistar.com/gateway.aspx?m=l&id=/matter.aspx?key=11315).&nbsp;

  State requirements for co-living housing

  The council also reviewed a proposed change to the city’s land use code that would allow co-living housing in areas where six or more residential units per lot are already permitted. This update is required under state law following the passage of House Bill 1998 in 2024 to expand housing options across Washington.&nbsp;

  Co-living housing consists of individual, lockable rooms with private living and sleeping areas where kitchen facilities are shared with others in the building.

  Transgender Awareness Proclamation

  The council also issued a proclamation for&nbsp;[Transgender Awareness Week and Transgender Day of Remembrance](https://bellevue.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&ID=14918884&GUID=E71F2188-FE90-486A-B6DD-3EA03AEE42E2). &nbsp;

The Bellevue City Council unanimously approved a $600,000 allocation from its contingency fund to assist organizations providing legal aid for immigrants and refugees, along with urgent food and financial support. This decision follows community requests during a public hearing concerning the 2025-2026 budget adjustments. The funding will be distributed equally among the three areas of assistance, complementing an earlier $235,000 approved for immediate food aid. 

Additionally, the council reviewed updates to the Critical Areas Ordinance, aimed at enhancing environmental protections in line with state law. These changes include modernizing rules and providing flexibility for land restoration while balancing growth. 

A proposed amendment to the city’s land use code was also discussed, which would permit co-living housing in designated areas per state law. This type of housing features private living spaces with shared kitchen facilities. A public hearing for this amendment is scheduled for December 2. 

Lastly, the council issued a proclamation for Transgender Awareness Week and Transgender Day of Remembrance, highlighting its commitment to inclusivity and support for the transgender community.
