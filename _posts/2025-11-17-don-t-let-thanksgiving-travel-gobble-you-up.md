The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) advises travelers to prepare for heavy traffic, delays, and potential winter weather this Thanksgiving weekend. Millions are expected to use highways, ferries, and trains, with significant congestion anticipated on routes like Interstate 90, US 2, and I-5. Travelers are encouraged to consult WSDOT's holiday travel charts to identify the best travel times and avoid peak hours. Most construction will pause to ease congestion, though crashes and road repairs may still cause delays. 

Travelers should also be aware of seasonal road closures, including State Routes 410 and 123, due to avalanche risks. While some mountain passes are closed, the SR 20/North Cascades Highway remains open. Tolls will be in effect on the SR 520 bridge and SR 99 tunnel, while express lanes on SR 167 and I-405 will be free on Thanksgiving. Long waits are expected for ferries, particularly on peak travel days. Amtrak Cascades passengers and travelers using local transit are advised to plan ahead to avoid delays. WSDOT provides resources like real-time traffic updates and safety tips for a smoother travel experience.
