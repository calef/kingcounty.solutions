Our Bellevue Family Hub has relocated from Stevenson Elementary School to Sherwood Forest Elementary School, just in time for the Bellevue School District's new school year. Sherwood Forest is one of the district's highest-need schools, providing a vital connection point for families. This move enhances our capacity to offer in-person support and increases access to families in need. The Hubs, launched in 2022 and 2023, have already provided essential services such as nutritional support, emergency rent assistance, and life-skills workshops to thousands of families, fostering stability and hope.

Accessibility is central to the Hub's mission, allowing families to walk in without appointments to receive assistance from bilingual Family Support Administrators. Personal stories highlight the transformative impact of the Hub, including a mother who found stable housing with guidance from staff. Despite the change in location, our commitment to meeting families with dignity and warmth remains steadfast. The Hub aims to grow its services and strengthen community partnerships, ensuring families know where to seek help. We invite the community to celebrate this new chapter at Sherwood Forest Elementary, working together to ensure every child has the necessary resources to thrive in school and life.
