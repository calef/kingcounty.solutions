  <p><strong>Our Bellevue Family Hub has a new home! </strong>This month, we relocated our Hub from Stevenson Elementary School to Sherwood Forest Elementary School—opening just in time to welcome Bellevue School District students back to class.</p>



  <p>Sherwood Forest is one of the district&#8217;s highest-need schools and is located down the street from Interlake High School, making it an ideal connection point for families we haven’t reached yet. This new location strengthens our ability to provide the in-person support families count on and expands access for those who need it most.</p>



  <p><strong>The launch of the Hubs</strong></p>



  <p>We launched our first Bellevue Family Hub in partnership with the Bellevue School District at Highland Middle School in 2022. The Hub at Highland opened with the shared mission to provide a welcoming place where students and families can easily access multiple compassionate support services in one space.</p>



  <p>Our second Hub opened at Stevenson Elementary School in 2023, providing a second trusted space for families to access nutritional support, emergency rent assistance, clothing resources, life-skills workshops, and more.</p>



  <p>Since 2022, the Hubs have supported thousands of families in their pathway to building more stable lives for their children.</p>



  <p>“Our Hubs have become trusted and welcoming spaces for families in need. They serve as a bridge to vital resources,” shared Ericka Belmontes, Bellevue LifeSpring Family Support Administrator. “Many families have shared that they feel seen, heard, and supported in ways they hadn’t before.”</p>



  <p><strong>Meeting families where they are</strong></p>



  <p>Accessibility is at the heart of the Hub. Families don’t need an appointment; they can simply walk in and meet one-on-one with our team of bilingual Family Support Administrators. By removing barriers like language, technology, and scheduling, the Hub creates a welcoming entry point for families seeking support and guidance.</p>



  <p>The personalized support families receive often leaves a lasting positive impact. Ericka recalls one mother who had just moved to Bellevue with little support: “She came to the Hub feeling overwhelmed and unsure of where to start. With guidance and connection to resources, she secured stable housing. Seeing her transformation from uncertainty to stability and hope was incredibly powerful and reminded me why this work matters.”</p>

Our Bellevue Family Hub has relocated from Stevenson Elementary School to Sherwood Forest Elementary School, just in time for the Bellevue School District's new school year. Sherwood Forest is one of the district's highest-need schools, providing a vital connection point for families. This move enhances our capacity to offer in-person support and increases access to families in need. The Hubs, launched in 2022 and 2023, have already provided essential services such as nutritional support, emergency rent assistance, and life-skills workshops to thousands of families, fostering stability and hope.

Accessibility is central to the Hub's mission, allowing families to walk in without appointments to receive assistance from bilingual Family Support Administrators. Personal stories highlight the transformative impact of the Hub, including a mother who found stable housing with guidance from staff. Despite the change in location, our commitment to meeting families with dignity and warmth remains steadfast. The Hub aims to grow its services and strengthen community partnerships, ensuring families know where to seek help. We invite the community to celebrate this new chapter at Sherwood Forest Elementary, working together to ensure every child has the necessary resources to thrive in school and life.
