  Hopelink community,

  I write to you today to announce the departure of Hopelink CEO Dr. Catherine Cushinberry, who became Hopelink CEO in March of 2021. Effective immediately, Dr. Catherine has decided to resign her role to take time to rest and renew before relaunching her consulting business.&nbsp;

  On behalf of the Hopelink Board of Directors and Senior Leadership Council, I’d like to thank Dr. Cushinberry for her service over the last two years. Coming on board while our community was facing some of its greatest challenges during the pandemic and with long-time Hopelink CEO Lauren Thomas retiring, Dr. Catherine brought in caring and thoughtful leadership.

  With her resignation, the Board of Directors has appointed me Interim CEO. I’ve had the privilege of being a part of the Hopelink community since 2004 and have served as Chief Operating Officer since 2015. I’ve seen this agency accomplish incredible things on behalf of our neighbors. I’m honored to steward Hopelink’s vision of a community free of poverty alongside a dedicated Board of Directors and Senior Leadership Staff. Hopelink thrives because of our caring and talented staff, an amazing community of volunteers and donors, and strong partnerships across the region.

  The future of Hopelink remains bright as we continue our three-year Strategic Plan, with our commitment to Equity, Diversity, Inclusion as our guiding light. I look forward to partnering with you along the way. If you have any questions or would like to connect, please [email Sr. Executive Administrator Andrew Routier](mailto:aroutier@hopelink.org).

  With appreciation,

  Geoff Crump, Hopelink Interim CEO
