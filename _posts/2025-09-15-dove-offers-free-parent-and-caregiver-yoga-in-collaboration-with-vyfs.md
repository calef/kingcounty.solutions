Dove is offering free yoga classes for parents and caregivers in collaboration with Vashon Youth and Family Services (VYFS). The classes aim to provide a supportive environment for participants to practice yoga and mindfulness, promoting relaxation and connection. Scheduled to take place at the VYFS building, these sessions will be led by experienced instructors and are designed to accommodate all skill levels, encouraging a sense of community and well-being among caregivers. Participants can expect to engage in gentle yoga practices that help reduce stress and improve mental clarity. The initiative reflects a commitment to supporting the mental health of caregivers, recognizing the challenges they face. Interested individuals are encouraged to register for the classes, which are set to begin soon, as the program aims to create a nurturing space for personal growth and self-care. This program not only benefits the participants but also fosters a stronger community connection on Vashon Island.
