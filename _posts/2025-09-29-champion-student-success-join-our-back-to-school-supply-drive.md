Youth and young adults are preparing to return to school, and there is a call for donations of school supplies, hygiene items, and snacks to support their success. Key supporters of this initiative include BECU, Foster Love, Gesa Credit Union, HopSkipDrive, Intracorp, and Trilogy for Kids, who contribute through annual donation drives. Suggested items for donation include backpacks, mechanical pencils, gel pens, notebooks, academic planners, full-size shampoo, conditioners, body wash, deodorant, and snacks to energize students during the school day. 

To participate, individuals can access the Amazon Gift Registry or explore various ways to contribute. Options include hosting a community donation drive, using the Amazon Wish List for direct delivery of items, or scheduling a drop-off of new school supplies and hygiene products at the Kirkland Youth Service Center, located at 13116 NE 132nd Street, Kirkland, WA, Tuesday through Friday from 8:30 AM to 5:00 PM. For further information or to get involved, interested parties can contact Meggan via email.
