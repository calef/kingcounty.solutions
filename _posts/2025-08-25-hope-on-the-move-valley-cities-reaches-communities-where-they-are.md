Valley Cities Behavioral Health Care is expanding its outreach efforts across King County, emphasizing the importance of connecting with individuals in their own environments, such as community centers and parks. For nearly 60 years, Valley Cities has provided care for those facing mental health challenges, substance use disorders, and housing instability. Their outreach teams actively engage in urban and rural areas to offer direct support, aiming to ensure that no one falls through the cracks.

During Mental Health Awareness Month, Valley Cities is increasing visibility and access by having clinicians available at community events for immediate intakes and care pathways. They strive to eliminate barriers to access, fostering a stigma-free environment for seeking help. With one in five U.S. adults experiencing mental illness annually, Valley Cities is committed to changing this statistic by bringing care into communities. Donors play a vital role in supporting their initiatives, including mobile clinics and outreach programs. Valley Cities encourages community involvement and offers various donation options to sustain and expand their services. For those struggling with mental health or addiction, Valley Cities provides contact information for assistance and support.
