Seattle police arrested a 30-year-old man in the Chinatown-International District for openly using Fentanyl on November 20. During proactive foot patrols at approximately 8:50 p.m., officers observed the suspect using suspected narcotics on the sidewalk near 12th Avenue South and South Jackson Street, a location noted for heavy foot traffic. Upon detaining him, they discovered he had a $1,000 warrant for his arrest. The officers seized baggies of Fentanyl and drug paraphernalia from the suspect, who is a convicted felon currently under supervision by the Department of Corrections and prohibited from engaging in criminal activities. He was subsequently booked into the King County Jail. The investigation is being handled by detectives from the Narcotics Unit. This arrest falls under the High Utilizer Initiative, a program developed by the Seattle City Attorney’s Office to monitor and hold accountable individuals frequently committing misdemeanor offenses in the city, in collaboration with the King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office, Seattle Police, and the King County Jail.
