During its third Inclusive Innovation Forum on June 4, 2025, the City of Bellevue will introduce a Civic Innovation Challenge aimed at fostering collaboration on civic technology solutions. The forum, scheduled from 6 to 8 p.m. at City Hall, targets local government, businesses, nonprofits, and community members to enhance innovation across city services. Nadia Hansen from Salesforce will deliver a keynote focused on inclusive innovation and the role of startups and civic tech in evolving digital government.

The challenge seeks design partnerships to tackle civic issues, offering recipients professional coaching, city resources, stipends, and opportunities to present their solutions to a civic tech audience. The initiative is supported by organizations such as Bellevue Downtown Association, Microsoft, Slalom, and T-Mobile. Additionally, attendees can volunteer to assist with digital equity and policy initiatives while sharing their work plans and successes. The City of Bellevue aims to create a sustainable culture of innovation and community engagement through this forum, bringing together diverse stakeholders to develop solutions that improve residents' quality of life.
