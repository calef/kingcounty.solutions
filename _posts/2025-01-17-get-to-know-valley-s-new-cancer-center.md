February 3, 2025, marks a significant advancement in cancer care with the opening of Phase 1A of Valley's comprehensive Cancer Center in South King County. Situated in the East Pavilion of Valley’s main campus, this modern facility consolidates the hospital's renowned cancer programs and services. The center will provide various offerings, including a dedicated infusion and immunotherapy center, an acute symptom management clinic, and a wellbeing support center for cancer patients. 

Moreover, the development continues with fundraising efforts aimed at completing the remaining $45 million needed for Phases 1B and 2. Phase 1B will feature a new Oncology & Hematology Clinic, a multidisciplinary clinic, a laboratory, and a café on the third floor, while Phase 2 will focus on radiation therapy and oncology imaging on the first floor. The community is encouraged to contribute through tax-deductible donations to support these upcoming phases. For further inquiries or information, individuals can reach out to Carrie Murayama, the Director of Philanthropy & Volunteer Services.
