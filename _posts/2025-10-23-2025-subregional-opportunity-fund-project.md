# King County Flood Control District's 2025 Subregional Opportunity Fund

The King County Flood Control District allocates annual funding through its Subregional Opportunity Fund to assist cities and jurisdictions in flood and stormwater risk reduction projects. Representing 10.23% of the district's levy proceeds, this year’s fund totals over $8.6 million, pending budget approval. Projects include habitat restoration, stormwater management improvements, and infrastructure upgrades across 40 jurisdictions. Notable funded initiatives for 2025 include culvert replacements, invasive species removal, and stormwater bypass systems, all aimed at enhancing community safety and environmental resilience.
