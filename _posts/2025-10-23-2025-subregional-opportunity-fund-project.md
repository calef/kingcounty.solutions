  By Steven Schauer, Deputy Executive Director

  Each year, the King County Flood Control District (KCFCD) sets aside funding through its Subregional Opportunity Fund for use by cities and jurisdictions within King County. These funds support the design and implementation of projects that reduce flood and stormwater risks. Projects focused on water quality or habitat improvement are also eligible, provided they directly address flooding or stormwater management.

  The Subregional Opportunity Fund represents 10.23 percent of the KCFCD’s annual levy proceeds. These funds are distributed among the 40 jurisdictions in King County based on their assessed property values, including any recent annexations. Each jurisdiction can apply annually for its share of funds – up to 10 percent of its levy proceeds allocation or $10,000, whichever is greater – to support local flood or stormwater initiatives.

  Jurisdictions recently completed their applications for the 2026 Subregional Opportunity Fund, which is estimated to total over $8.6 million, pending final budget approval by the KCFCD Board of Supervisors in November 2025.

  “The Subregional Opportunity Fund turns local priorities into real flood-risk reductions,” said Michelle Clark, King County Flood Control District Executive Director. “By dedicating funding directly to our 40 jurisdictions, we empower local experts to deliver on projects that matter most to their residents. It’s a smart, community-driven investment helping to keep neighborhoods safe, restore habitats, and strengthen resilience countywide.”

  The following list highlights all projects that received funding from the 2025 Subregional Opportunity Fund, showcasing the diverse local efforts underway to reduce flood risks and improve stormwater management across King County.

  ## Algona

  ### _Algona Floodplain Resilience Initiative received $10,000._

  The City of Algona proposed to allocate Subregional Opportunity Fund resources to acquire a strategically significant parcel of property located in a designated flood plain. Acquiring the additional property enhances the city’s capacity for effective stormwater management and flood risk reduction by securing contiguous control over a floodplain area adjacent to its existing holdings.

  ## Beaux Arts Village

  ### _Beaux Arts Village 2025 Annual Clean and Camera Project received $10,000._

  The project will address the maintenance needed for storm lines along 1000-10600 SE 27TH ST and 10500-10600 SE 28TH ST, following the stormwater management plan. The proposed activity will remove any build-up or debris within the stormwater system, increasing efficiency and maintaining the infrastructure.

  ## Bellevue

  ### _Upper Kelsey Creek Ph 2 – Culvert Replacement at Lake Hills Blvd Project received $955,798. This funding is in addition to the $1,245,968 the project has previously received._

  This project will replace the existing corrugated metal culverts built in the early 1990s that carry Kelsey Creek beneath Lake Hills Boulevard. The culverts are undersized, unstable, and deteriorating, causing an increased risk of flooding. Complete replacement is needed to reduce the potential for flooding. Failure of the culvert at this location could damage nearby utilities and close the roadway. The project will also address the critical water and sewer main crossing at the creek and a flat sewer within the Lake Hills Green Belt.

  ## Bothell

  ### _Parr Creek – Invasive Plant Removal and Replanting 2025 Project received $67,599. This funding is in addition to the $120,000 the project has previously received._

  The Parr Creek Restoration Project will be removing invasive plant species and enhancing the riparian area covering 17,000 square feet in several locations adjacent to Parr Creek in the Bothell Business Park.&nbsp;Applied Ecology, LLC&nbsp;will be planting approximately 5,400 native plant species along the stream corridor to promote more shading for the creek and enhance fish habitat. Temporary plant protection measures will be put in place to help plants become established and discourage herbivory. Ongoing invasive species control and planting of native species will occur as needed throughout the project.

  ## Carnation

  ### _Commercial/Tolt Ave Stormwater Bypass received $10,000._

  The project creates an additional bypass for stormwater to enter into the city’s system to help avoid overwhelming the stormwater system. This will help address flooding caused by stormwater, which can overwhelm the system by Commercial Street and the southwest corner of Tolt Ave. The city will create an additional curb opening on the southwest curb line of Commercial Street to aid in the capture of the stormwater coming toward Tolt Ave and East Commercial Street.

  ## Hunts Point

  ### _Hunts Point 2025 Stormwater Clean and Camera Project received $13,162._

  The project will clean and camera through the storm lines along Hunts Point Lane and 80th Ave NE and NE 28th St, which outfalls to Lake Washington. The proposed activity will remove any build-up or debris within the stormwater system, increasing efficiency and maintaining the infrastructure.

  ## Kenmore

  ### _Muck Creek Restoration Project received $52,002._

  The project proposes to restore riparian habitat and floodplain storage along Muck Creek (a small tributary to Swamp Creek) on a city owned 1.34-acre property located at 18727 73RD AVE NE. The project removes previously flooded structures, restores riparian habitat, and increases floodplain storage.

  ## Kent

  ### _Mill Creek Little Property Floodplain Reconnection Project received $129,027._

  The project, located at an undeveloped city-owned site knows as the Little Property, located due east of Woodford Avenue North and north of East James Street, is a relocation of a linearized creek channel to a sinuous design with floodplain connection, habitat structure installation, and native planting. This work will involve the relocation of Mill Creek. This reach of Mill Creek is linear and degraded leading to frequent flooding of adjacent neighborhoods and roads. The existing channel alignment and condition also provides poor habitat conditions for salmon and other fish. The proposed project will move the creek east, away from homes allowing for the creation of significant floodplain habitat creation (5.5 acres) and will provide for more stream complexity for salmonids rearing and refuge needs.

  ### _James Street Storm Drainage Improvement Project received $100,000. This funding is in addition to the $224,790 the project has previously received._

  ### _Earthworks Sediment Pond Culvert Replacement Project received $327,585. This funding is in addition to the $213,858 the project has previously received._

  Kent recently completed geotechnical borings near the Earthworks Sediment Pond Culvert Replacement Project. Soils analysis and other field data are currently being collected to support design of the proposed replacement culvert.

  ## King County

  ### _Madsen Creek Tributary 0306A Facility Rehabilitation Project received $300,000._

  King County proposes to replace a component of Stormwater Regional Facility DR0515 and an adjoining road culvert by installing a fish passable culvert, slope protection measures, and stream and habitat features to reduce local and downstream impacts from a pipe collapse. The project is located at Fairwood Blvd SE east of 151st Ave SE in unincorporated King County near Renton, WA at Madsen Creek Tributary 0306A, which is tributary to the Cedar River. The project will address aged and deteriorated infrastructure at risk of developing sinkholes and address the fish barrier the aged infrastructure poses to the creek.

  ### _Poo Poo Point Trailhead Flooding Study received $100,000._

  King County proposed an assessment and feasibility study for the Poo Poo Point Trailhead, a popular King County Park that experiences chronic flooding along the trail, the parking lot, and occasionally across Issaquah-Hobart Road. The flooding creates unsafe access to the trails, field, and parking lot for hikers and paragliders, and there is a high cost of labor, specialists, and equipment to maintain area during fall and winter. Additionally, there is a fish passage barrier caused by sediment accumulations. The study will pinpoint causes of flooding and recommend multi-benefit solutions to address the problems.

  ### _White Center Ponds Redesign Project received $120,182. This funding is in addition to the $225,000 the project has previously received._

  White Center Ponds is an existing King County Stormwater regional drainage facility that provides flood control and water quality treatment for 174 acres of Unincorporated King County and the City of Seattle. The site is also a publicly-accessible green space that is underused by the community due to longstanding safety concerns. The dense vegetation blocks sightlines and the lack of lighting makes it difficult for residents to see what is going on. The ponds also dry out in the late spring through early fall which allows illicit activities to proliferate out of view. The redesign project is working with the White Center community to develop the design for a stormwater park that will turn a neighborhood liability into an asset. Now at 90% completion, the design proposes to excavate the existing ponds, which will increase storage capacity, improve water quality treatment, and provide year-round ponding to discourage unwanted access. To ensure the redesigned site is welcoming for the community, the design opens up sightlines and includes lighting on the entirety of the expanded ½ mile loop path. The design also restores open water wetland habitat by removing invasive plant species, replanting thoughtfully with native plants appropriate for an urban park, and adding habitat features for birds, amphibians, and bats. The design team is also working with 4Culture on including public art that reflects the diversity of the vibrant White Center community. The project plans to complete 100% design by the end of 2026 for summer 2027 construction. This project was first awarded Subregional Opportunity Funds in 2024; so far, the funds have facilitated moving the design from 30% to 90% completion by funding both King County and consultant project management, engineering, and landscape architecture staff time.

  ### _Cemetery Pond Wetland Protection and Restoration Project received $744,036._

  The project will improve water quality in May Creek by removing historic fill onsite and restoring more than 3 acres of newly established wetland and buffer. This will increase residence time and storage capacity in the wetland, allowing pollutants to settle out before flowing out of the wetland. Restoration will also improve health of the wetland. The Cemetery Pond Restoration project works closely with community partners. The project is located southeast of the intersection of SE 128th St and 164th Ave SE.

  ## Kirkland

  ### _Downtown Crosswalk Stormwater Improvements for Flood Reduction Project received $462,258._

  The project will construct two catch basins, conveyance pipe, curb, gutter, and sidewalk to prevent localized flooding and frequent maintenance of an undersized stormwater inlet. Construction will be with a crosswalk improvement for safety. The City often receives complaints about flooding from a clogged, undersized trench drain, impacting the roadway, a busy crosswalk, and an ADA ramp. This creates safety concerns for vehicles, pedestrians, and individuals with accessibility needs. This project installs a through-curb vaned grate inlet to enhance stormwater collection and add redundancy for debris buildup, which will reduce flooding occurrences and response. New catch basins will improve maintenance access as well.

  ## Medina

  ### _2025 Medina Park North Pond Vegetation Removal Project received $70,790._

  The project will manually remove overgrown lily pads and root system in the Medina Park North Pond to increase stormwater capacity.

  ## Mercer Island

  ### _Luther Burbank Waterfront Drainage LID Design Project and Luther Burbank Waterfront Drainage LID Construction Project received a combined total of $150,882. This funding is in addition to more than $900,000 these projects have previously received._

  ### _Luther Burbank Waterfront Drainage LID Construction – Sewer Vault and Plaza Access Project received $215,813._

  ## Renton

  ### _Panther Creek at Talbot Road S Culvert Lining Project received $195,853._

  Panther Creek is conveyed across Talbot Rd S in a 42 in. CMP. A CCTV revealed that the bottom of the pipe has eroded. This project will line the deteriorated pipe to avoid further erosion/damage and provide time to complete a long-term solution. By lining the pipe, Renton is reducing the risk of pipe collapse and failure of the roadway embankment which would cause flooding to surrounding properties. This is a short-term solution while the City designs a long-term culvert replacement project.

  ## Sammamish

  ### _2025 Stormwater Retrofit Project received $515,448._

  As part of its commitment to protecting water quality and reducing stormwater impacts, the City of Sammamish, in partnership with its engineering consultant and with funding support from the King County Flood Control District, is preparing to launch two targeted stormwater retrofit projects slated for construction in 2026. These projects—located in the&nbsp; Demery Hill development and at the intersection of SE 20th Street & 228th Avenue SE—are designed to improve water quality with a focus on phosphorus removal, while minimizing disruption to nearby residents and public infrastructure.

  Site 1: Demery Hill: Located in a residential area with aging stormwater infrastructure, the Demery Hill retrofit will upgrade existing systems to better manage runoff and reduce phosphorus and total suspended solids into local streams through Inglewood subbasin and into Lake Sammamish.

  Site 2: SE 20th Street & 228th Avenue SE: This site, situated near a key arterial and adjacent neighborhoods, presents an opportunity to retrofit stormwater facilities in a way that balances water quality goals with community accessibility and infrastructure preservation. Water quality treatment will focus on reducing phosphorus and total suspended solids from being conveyed through the downstream system and into Pine Lake within one-quarter mile of the project site. This site drains to Pine Lake prior to entering Pine Lake Creek and ultimately discharges to Lake Sammamish.

  Both projects are part of the City’s broader Stormwater Retrofit Program, which prioritizes locations based on pollutant loading potential, feasibility, and community benefit.

  ## Seattle

  ### _Landsburg Dam Debris Passage Improvement Project received $700,000._

  The City of Seattle has greatly benefited from the King County Flood Control District’s Sub-regional Opportunity Fund (SROF) over the years. SROF funding has allowed Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) to invest in natural drainage solutions in multiple neighborhoods across the city. Natural drainage systems improve water quality by removing the amount of pollution entering urban creeks, Lake Washington, and Puget Sound. They slow water during heavy rains, which keeps our stormwater and sewer systems from becoming overwhelmed. They also add trees and landscaping and enhance traffic calming. Examples of SROF-funded natural drainage projects include in the Greenwood and Olympic Hills neighborhoods. SROF funding has also allowed SPU to make improvements that safeguard dams that are part of our drinking water system, reducing flood risk and protecting critical infrastructure.

  ## Tukwila

  ### _South 131<sup>st</sup> Place Drainage Improvements Project received $62,442. This funding is in addition to the $180,894 the project has previously received._

  The South 131st Place Drainage Improvement Project will address local flooding of roadway and adjacent private properties and address upstream issues that contribute to flooding, water quality concerns and present fish barriers and habitat degradation. The project will restore access and habitat and will be designed to allow juvenile fish passage upstream. The project area is constrained by local roads, residential, industrial, and commercial development, and local utilities.

  ## Yarrow Point

  ### _Town of Yarrow Point 2025 Stormwater Clean and Camera Project received $15,514._

  The project will clean debris and blockage out of storm lines and camera along 94TH AVE NE and 47TH ST; as well as 36TH ST, 90TH AVE NE, 91ST AVE NE, and 34TH ST. The project will address the stormwater management and maintenance needed for the noted areas, as outlined in the Storm Camera and Clean Schedule. The proposed activity will remove any build-up or debris within the stormwater system, increasing efficiency and maintaining the infrastructure.
