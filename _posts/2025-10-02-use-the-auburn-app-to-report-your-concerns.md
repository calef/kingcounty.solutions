Auburn's Parks Department oversees nearly 1,000 acres of parkland and more than 20 miles of trails, providing various recreational opportunities. The Auburn Farmers Market operates seasonally from June to September at Les Gove Park. The Auburn Community and Event Center offers a wide range of activities for children, along with a comprehensive Community Fitness Program that includes numerous classes, open gym sessions, and access to equipment and a weight room. Residents can utilize the Auburn App, SeeClickFix, to report issues such as graffiti, abandoned vehicles, and potholes, as well as manage utility bills and stay informed about local news and events. The app encourages community participation to help Auburn function at its best.
