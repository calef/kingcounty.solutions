LCSNW’s housing services team has expanded from six to 11 members with the introduction of three new programs in the Greater Puget Sound District. A new Tacoma team has been established to address increasing community needs. Through contracts for Rapid Rehousing Programs in King and Pierce County, LCSNW aims to assist individuals and families experiencing homelessness, including those sleeping in cars or other unsuitable places. This program helps clients improve their living situations and achieve long-term self-sufficiency by providing rent assistance, resource referrals, and intensive case management. A newly funded Homelessness Prevention Rent Assistance program focuses on preventing eviction and homelessness. David Moser, Housing Services Manager, highlights that many unhoused individuals are employed but face high rents and a scarcity of affordable housing, making them vulnerable to housing loss. He emphasizes the importance of prevention resources for community stability. The expanded services also enhance language accessibility, with staff now speaking seven languages. Since January 2024, LCSNW has served approximately 3,750 individuals in 1,500 households. Additionally, LCSNW is collaborating with Compass Housing Alliance to enhance housing expertise and aims for full integration with the organization.
