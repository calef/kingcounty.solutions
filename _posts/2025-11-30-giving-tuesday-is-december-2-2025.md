Giving Tuesday will take place on December 2, 2025, following the Thanksgiving holiday and Black Friday. This global generosity movement encourages individuals, families, and organizations to support their favorite charities and causes. The Westside Neighbors Shelter invites community members to participate by donating to help provide shelter, food, and support services for those in need. The organization emphasizes the importance of every contribution, regardless of size, in making a difference in the lives of vulnerable populations. Donations received on Giving Tuesday will directly benefit local families experiencing homelessness, allowing the shelter to continue its mission of fostering stability and hope. Supporters are encouraged to share their involvement with the initiative on social media, using the hashtag #GivingTuesday, to inspire others to join the cause. The shelter highlights that with the community's support, they can create a significant impact and help change lives for the better during this season of giving.
