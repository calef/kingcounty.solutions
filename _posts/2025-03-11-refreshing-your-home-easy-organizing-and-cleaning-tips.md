As temperatures rise, many feel inspired to undertake spring cleaning to refresh and organize their homes. To make this process easier, work in small time increments rather than trying to finish in a single day. Focus on decluttering by sorting items into keep, donate, and trash categories with the help of friends or family. Avoid heavy lifting to prevent injury; seek assistance or hire professionals for moving heavy objects. Check medicine cabinets for expired medications and dispose of them properly, restocking essential items to ensure readiness in emergencies. Safety devices such as smoke and carbon monoxide detectors should be tested and have batteries replaced; enlist help if they are hard to reach. Lastly, refresh the kitchen by removing expired items from the refrigerator and pantry, and organize remaining items by grouping similar products together. This not only tidies the kitchen but also simplifies meal preparation.
