United Way of King County advocates for Seattle voters to support Proposition 1 in the upcoming election, which seeks to renew the Families, Education, Preschool & Promise (FEPP) Levy. This initiative has historically aided children and youth across the city by providing essential services. If passed, Prop 1 will expand preschool access by adding 600 high-quality seats and doubling childcare assistance to benefit 1,400 children annually. It will also enhance school-based health services by establishing five new clinics and increasing telehealth options for over 6,500 youth. Furthermore, the measure aims to maintain tuition-free college opportunities through the Seattle Promise Program and to create new career pathways in trades and high-demand sectors. The investment would cost the average homeowner approximately $27 more per month, with the goal of ensuring that every child is adequately prepared for kindergarten and future success. The United Way emphasizes that investing in children is crucial for building stronger communities. Ballots are due by November 4, 2025, and the community is encouraged to vote YES on Prop 1 to secure a brighter future for Seattle's families.
