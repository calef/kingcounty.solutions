On July 1, 2024, Hall Health Center at the University of Washington will be renamed the Husky Health Center, continuing its legacy of quality healthcare for students. For over 75 years, Hall Health Center has served the UW community, but confusion arose due to unrelated departments within the building and misconceptions about its services being limited to residence halls. The facility will retain the name "David C. Hall Building," while all student health services will be unified under the Husky Health Center title. This change aims to clarify the mission of the clinic and strengthen its connection to the UW community, honoring the legacy of Dr. David C. Hall. Executive director Joel Schwartzkopf emphasized that the new name reflects a commitment to being a welcoming and inclusive space for student health and wellbeing. The Husky Health Center will provide a range of services, including primary care, physical therapy, immunizations, and 24/7 nurse advice, without any expected changes in clinic operations or patient experience during the transition. Students with questions about the new name or services can contact the center directly.
