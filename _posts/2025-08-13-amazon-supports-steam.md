Partnering with Amazon has significantly enhanced ReWA’s Youth Program by incorporating advanced robotics into the STEAM curriculum. Students, particularly those with limited access to technology, are acquiring vital 21st-century skills in coding, engineering, and automation through hands-on experiences with the Path-Following Robot. The afterschool program promotes deeper engagement via interactive projects and mentorship from Amazon volunteers. A recent field trip to an Amazon facility allowed students to work alongside engineers to build and test robots, igniting their curiosity about STEAM careers. The Path-Following Robot teaches middle and high school students foundational concepts in electronics, sensors, and Arduino programming. With user-friendly components and customizable coding challenges, students learn how programmable hardware interacts with the physical world, honing their problem-solving, teamwork, and computational thinking abilities. This partnership opens up exciting possibilities and demonstrates gratitude for Amazon’s role in inspiring the next generation of innovators.
