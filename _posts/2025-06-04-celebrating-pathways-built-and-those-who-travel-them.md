  /></p><p><span class=\"tmc-serif-subhead\" style=\"color: #595959;\">For Florene,
  it was help paying the upfront costs of securing a new apartment after a period
  of homelessness. For Lyssa, it was a two-bedroom apartment and the support of a
  case manager. For others, it’s help putting food on the table, a ride to and from
  a doctor’s appointment, or the support of a behavioral health counselor.</span></p>\n<p><span
  data-contrast=\"none\">The truth is, everybody who’s experienced poverty must travel
  their own unique path to move beyond it – to a life of stability, opportunity, and
  hope. That’s why, for just over 50 years, Solid Ground has worked to meet people
  where they are to help them build their own personal pathway</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">s</span><span
  data-contrast=\"none\"> to a better future.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span
  data-contrast=\"none\">It’s also why more than 250 members of the Solid Ground community
  gathered for our annual Gala this spring to celebrate those pathways, uplift the
  people who’ve traveled them, and pledge to build even more together. Held in the
  Seattle Convention Center’s Summit building on May 28, this year’s celebration featured
  poetry, photography, jazz, food, and inspiring words from the frontlines of our
  work to solve poverty.</span><span data-contrast=\"none\"> </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span

  we can all rely on’ </span></h4>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Though this year’s
  Gala was marked by celebration, joy, and hope, there was no escaping the urgency
  and need that we currently face as a community and as a nation. Shalimar Gonzales,
  Solid Ground’s CEO, put it plainly:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span
  data-contrast=\"none\">“There are a lot of things happening in our nation&#8217;s
  capital and across the country today that pose a grave threat to the freedom and
  well-being of each and every one of us, especially communities that are often the
  most vulnerable and marginalized even in the best of times,” she said. “The onslaught
  of unilateral executive orders, funding cuts, and mass firings coming from the White
  House has the potential to rapidly erode our community&#8217;s ability to keep our
  most vulnerable neighbors fed, housed, and healthy.”</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span
  data-contrast=\"none\">“In the last few weeks, there&#8217;s been a direct attack
  on nonprofits with an executive order suggesting that we can be deemed a terrorist
  organization at the whim of this administration,” Shalimar continued. “And although
  we do not know what will come next, what we do know is this: We have entered a time
  that demands courage from all of us. And for Solid Ground, this means that we will
  not capitulate in the face of threats from our federal government.”</span><span
  data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><iframe title=\"Shalimar Gonzales CEO - Solid

  us that just five years ago, many of us believed the pandemic would be the greatest
  challenge we would have to overcome as a community. But, she said, we got through
  it – and we will get through this as well – together.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span
  data-contrast=\"none\">“If there&#8217;s one thing the pandemic has taught me, it’s
  that there is something that we can all rely on. We can rely on each other,” she
  said. “We can rely on each other for a helping hand. We can rely on each other for
  guidance and encouragement. And we can rely on our partners like you all in this
  room today to support us.”</span></p>\n<hr />\n<div id=\"attachment_69750\" style=\"width:

  data-contrast=\"none\">Broadview Shelter and Transitional Housing</span></a><span
  data-contrast=\"none\">, described the transformation and growth she’s seen in the
  children of parents escaping domestic violence. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span
  data-contrast=\"none\">“One of my favorite parts of this work is to be able to offer
  programs and experiences that excite, empower our youth to explore their world,
  to grow in confidence, to discover big ideas, and express themselves in a safe space,”
  she said. “We provide that safe and stable space to be children and to gain the
  tools to grow into their best selves.”</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span
  data-contrast=\"none\">Amy recalled a long car ride with several Broadview kids
  in which they thoughtfully debated a critical question: “Are we homeless?”</span><span

  were old enough to be aware that other people did consider them homeless,” she said.
  “They didn&#8217;t have forever places to live, but they didn&#8217;t live outside.
  They were safe and life was more reliable. They ate every day, they had new clothes
  and they had school supplies. They had fun things to do and friends to do it with.</span><span
  data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">“It was an incredibly
  thoughtful discussion to witness,” she continued. “And in the end, our kids decided,
  ‘Nah, we&#8217;re not homeless.’ They&#8217;re not homeless because they had Broadview,
  they had each other. They weren&#8217;t homeless because they had us, and they have
  you.”</span></p>\n<hr />\n<div id=\"attachment_69746\" style=\"width: 410px\" class=\"wp-caption

  data-contrast=\"none\">We also heard from Florene Jimerson, a young photographer
  whose childhood growing up in Seattle’s Central District was characterized by instability
  and displacement fueled by the neighborhood’s rapid gentrification.</span><span
  data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">“I knew that
  the circumstances that I was in wasn&#8217;t necessarily the fault of my parents
  or myself or anybody else around us,” Florene said in a video played for the audience.
  “It was literally the systems that were placed in America. It was the systems that
  were placed to keep us down, the Black families down. I&#8217;ve just been able
  to see gentrification really be the main reason why my childhood was so unstable.”</span><span

  with Solid Ground, she was in her mid-20s and had just experienced another period
  of homelessness. She had a steady job and earned enough to pay rent, but she didn’t
  have the thousands of dollars she needed to cover the up</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">front
  costs of leasing an apartment.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span
  data-contrast=\"none\">Solid Ground took care of it, and Florene moved into her
  new apartment in the Central District – the same community that she’d been forced
  out of by raising housing costs earlier in her life. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span
  data-contrast=\"none\">“It&#8217;s so important that programs like Solid Ground
  exist</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">,</span><span data-contrast=\"none\"> because
  they just remove the small little barriers that keep people stuck into not wanting
  to fight, or having these opportunities</span><span data-contrast=\"none\">,</span><span
  data-contrast=\"none\"> or just being able to be in healthy spaces to thrive,” she
  said.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Besides
  giving her a stable place to live, the new apartment gave Florene a chance to focus
  on her passion for photography. Several of her prints were displayed just outside
  the Gala ballroom, and others were printed on a set of greeting cards that attendees
  were invited to take home.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p>\n<p><b><i><span

  Florene, it was help paying the upfront costs of securing a new apartment after
  a period of homelessness. For Lyssa, it was a two-bedroom apartment and the support
  of a case manager.&nbsp;For others, it’s help putting food on the table, a ride
  to and from a doctor’s appointment, or the support of a behavioral health counselor.\n\nThe
  truth is, everybody who’s experienced poverty must travel their own unique path
  to move beyond it – to a life of stability, opportunity, and hope. That’s why, for
  just over 50 years, Solid Ground has worked to meet people where they are to help
  them build their own personal pathways to a better future.&nbsp;\n\nIt’s also why
  more than 250 members of the Solid Ground community gathered for our annual Gala
  this spring to celebrate those pathways, uplift the people who’ve traveled them,
  and pledge to build even more together. Held in the Seattle Convention Center’s
  Summit building on May 28, this year’s celebration featured poetry, photography,
  jazz, food, and inspiring words from the frontlines of our work to solve poverty.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n“I
  believe the answers are in this room,” Erin Jones – an educator, author, and advocate
  – told the crowd from the ballroom stage. “I believe the resources are in this room.”\n\n*

  \"Solid Ground.\"](https://s14621.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Shalimar-Gala-MBM-05.28.25-1-EDITED-400px.jpg)\n\nShalimar
  Gonzales, Solid Ground CEO (photo by Michael B. Maine)\n\n#### ‘Something we can
  all rely on’&nbsp;\n\nThough this year’s Gala was marked by celebration, joy, and
  hope, there was no escaping the urgency and need that we currently face as a community
  and as a nation. Shalimar Gonzales, Solid Ground’s CEO, put it plainly:&nbsp;\n\n“There
  are a lot of things happening in our nation’s capital and across the country today
  that pose a grave threat to the freedom and well-being of each and every one of
  us, especially communities that are often the most vulnerable and marginalized even
  in the best of times,” she said. “The onslaught of unilateral executive orders,
  funding cuts, and mass firings coming from the White House has the potential to
  rapidly erode our community’s ability to keep our most vulnerable neighbors fed,
  housed, and healthy.”&nbsp;\n\n“In the last few weeks, there’s been a direct attack
  on nonprofits with an executive order suggesting that we can be deemed a terrorist
  organization at the whim of this administration,” Shalimar continued. “And although
  we do not know what will come next, what we do know is this: We have entered a time
  that demands courage from all of us. And for Solid Ground, this means that we will
  not capitulate in the face of threats from our federal government.”&nbsp;\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/jwuxWuN9YVk?list=PLo1wnT8PPVsY_Lk8dGhGpfQAmUUWU6Pd0\n\nShalimar
  reminded us that just five years ago, many of us believed the pandemic would be
  the greatest challenge we would have to overcome as a community. But, she said,
  we got through it – and we will get through this as well – together.&nbsp;\n\n“If
  there’s one thing the pandemic has taught me, it’s that there is something that
  we can all rely on. We can rely on each other,” she said. “We can rely on each other
  for a helping hand. We can rely on each other for guidance and encouragement. And
  we can rely on our partners like you all in this room today to support us.”\n\n*

  H, Broadview Domestic Violence Children’s Program Supervisor\n\n#### ‘Are we homeless?’&nbsp;\n\nWhat
  does this support make possible? As just one example, Amy H., Domestic Violence
  Children’s Program Supervisor at Solid Ground’s [Broadview Shelter and Transitional
  Housing](https://www.solid-ground.org/what-we-do/housing-homelessness/#broadview),
  described the transformation and growth she’s seen in the children of parents escaping
  domestic violence.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n“One of my favorite parts of this work is to be
  able to offer programs and experiences that excite, empower our youth to explore
  their world, to grow in confidence, to discover big ideas, and express themselves
  in a safe space,” she said. “We provide that safe and stable space to be children
  and to gain the tools to grow into their best selves.”&nbsp;\n\nAmy recalled a long
  car ride with several Broadview kids in which they thoughtfully debated a critical
  question: “Are we homeless?”&nbsp;\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/DxAgANMcAcY?feature=oembed\n\n“Some
  of the kids were old enough to be aware that other people did consider them homeless,”
  she said. “They didn’t have forever places to live, but they didn’t live outside.
  They were safe and life was more reliable. They ate every day, they had new clothes
  and they had school supplies. They had fun things to do and friends to do it with.&nbsp;\n\n“It
  was an incredibly thoughtful discussion to witness,” she continued. “And in the
  end, our kids decided, ‘Nah, we’re not homeless.’ They’re not homeless because they
  had Broadview, they had each other. They weren’t homeless because they had us, and
  they have you.”\n\n* * *\n\n ![A young woman in a brown suit smiles and leans against

  Jimerson, photographer & Solid Ground participant\n\n#### ‘Healthy spaces to thrive’&nbsp;\n\nWe
  also heard from Florene Jimerson, a young photographer whose childhood growing up
  in Seattle’s Central District was characterized by instability and displacement
  fueled by the neighborhood’s rapid gentrification.&nbsp;\n\n“I knew that the circumstances
  that I was in wasn’t necessarily the fault of my parents or myself or anybody else
  around us,” Florene said in a video played for the audience. “It was literally the
  systems that were placed in America. It was the systems that were placed to keep
  us down, the Black families down. I’ve just been able to see gentrification really
  be the main reason why my childhood was so unstable.”&nbsp;\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/AMZBuVU4KS8?feature=oembed\n\nWhen
  Florene connected with Solid Ground, she was in her mid-20s and had just experienced
  another period of homelessness. She had a steady job and earned enough to pay rent,
  but she didn’t have the thousands of dollars she needed to cover the upfront costs
  of leasing an apartment.&nbsp;\n\nSolid Ground took care of it, and Florene moved
  into her new apartment in the Central District – the same community that she’d been
  forced out of by raising housing costs earlier in her life.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n“It’s
  so important that programs like Solid Ground exist, because they just remove the
  small little barriers that keep people stuck into not wanting to fight, or having
  these opportunities, or just being able to be in healthy spaces to thrive,” she
  said.&nbsp;\n\nBesides giving her a stable place to live, the new apartment gave
  Florene a chance to focus on her passion for photography. Several of her prints
  were displayed just outside the Gala ballroom, and others were printed on a set
  of greeting cards that attendees were invited to take home.&nbsp;\n\n**_See more

  was followed by a performance from Lyssa Bastet, a poet and mother who lives in
  Solid Ground’s [Sand Point Housing](https://www.solid-ground.org/what-we-do/housing-homelessness/#sandpointhousing).\n\n
  ![A woman in a red dress and long teal dreadlocks speaks at a podium on a stage.](https://s14621.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Lyssa-Bastet-Gala-MBM-05.28.25-59-400px.jpg)\n\nLyssa
  Bastet, poet & Sand Point Housing resident\n\nIn her specially commissioned poem,
  Lyssa described months of desperate fundraising on Facebook to make ends meet while
  living in a shelter with her nonverbal toddler. Here’s an excerpt:&nbsp;\n\n_“For
  two months,_   \n_I made phone calls._   \n_I went to appointments._   \n_I filled
  out applications._   \n_I pushed a giant stroller to the market._   \n_I cried in
  bed at night._   \n_I can honestly say I never lost hope._   \n_I lost sleep, I
  lost patience,  \nI lost most of my mind._    \n_But hope?_   \n_I’ve always been
  foolishly full of it.”_\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/LdDgdtDy4Fc?feature=oembed\n\nAnd
  she described the transformations that became possible when she found the stability
  and support of Solid Ground’s Sand Point community. Today, Lyssa’s son is an “opinionated
  and sassy” third grader with “intense main-character energy.”\n\n_“I am now an aspiring
  poet,_  \n_still housed, still making noise_   \n_about spirituality, mental illness,
  politics_   \n_and what could be achieved_  \n_with the simple gift_   \n_of Solid
  Ground.”&nbsp;_\n\n**_See more of Lyssa’s_**  **_work on her Patreon page,_** [**_A

  Jones, educator & author\n\n#### ‘Every single person’&nbsp;\n\nWe closed out the
  night with words of wisdom from Erin Jones, a longtime celebrated educator and author
  of [**_Bridges to Heal US: Stories and Strategies for Racial Healing_**](https://www.erinjonesdreams.com/books).
  She described the revelations, as a teenager, that led her to a career in teaching.&nbsp;\n\n“I
  knew by the time I was 19 years old that zip code and race and home language were
  absolutely the greatest predictors of how children got to experience school. But
  I also knew by 19 that America likes to wait until people are really failing before
  they invest,” she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/vhDlnFHQHCw?feature=oembed\n\n“So
  why am I here tonight? Because Solid Ground is on the front end of this. Solid Ground
  is looking at the back end and the front end and thinking about, ‘What can we do
  to be that safety net so that people don’t have to get to the place where they have
  nothing?’&nbsp;\n\n“And I think what that requires is seeing every person –&nbsp;that
  person on the corner, that person sleeping in their car – being willing to see every
  single person as valuable.”\n\n**_Couldn’t make the Gala? Don’t worry! There are

Solid Ground celebrated more than 50 years of supporting individuals facing poverty at its annual gala on May 28, 2025, in Seattle. The event brought together more than 250 community members to honor personal pathways to stability and opportunity. Attendees enjoyed poetry, photography, jazz, and inspiring speeches, including remarks from CEO Shalimar Gonzales. She highlighted the urgent challenges posed by national policies threatening vulnerable communities and the importance of solidarity in overcoming such obstacles.

The gala featured personal stories from participants like Florene Jimerson, who shared her journey from homelessness to stability, aided by Solid Ground's programs. Lyssa Bastet, a poet and mother, recounted her struggles while living in a shelter and the hope she found through the support of Solid Ground. They emphasized the critical role of community in providing the resources necessary for transformation.

Erin Jones, an educator, concluded the event by advocating for the recognition of every individual's value and the need for preventative support systems, reinforcing Solid Ground's commitment to helping people before they reach crisis points. The evening underscored the importance of collective action and support in addressing poverty and fostering resilience.
