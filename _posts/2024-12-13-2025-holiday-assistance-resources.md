A comprehensive list of holiday assistance resources for 2025 has been compiled to assist families during the November and December season. Hopelink's Food Markets will provide seasonal foods, including turkeys and groceries, on a first-come, first-served basis at various locations. Key events include a Thanksgiving dinner hosted by Holy Family Parish on November 27, and community meals at St. John’s Episcopal Church and the Bread of Life Mission. Eastridge Church plans to distribute 1,500 turkeys and bags of groceries on November 22.

Additional programs include the USPS Operation Santa, which allows children to write letters to Santa for possible gifts, and the Forgotten Children’s Fund, providing holiday experiences for families in need. Various community dinners and potlucks are scheduled throughout the season, including the Pride Across the Bridge Holiday Potluck on December 13 and weekly community dinners in Seattle. Gift programs and holiday fairs are also available to support families during this festive time, with events happening in various locations across Snohomish and Pierce Counties.
