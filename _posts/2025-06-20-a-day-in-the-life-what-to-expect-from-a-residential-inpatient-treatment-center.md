  you’ve been struggling with drug or alcohol addiction, deciding to enter treatment
  is a truly life-changing choice. And even when you know it’s the right choice, making
  a big change can feel overwhelming and intimidating. Knowing what to expect can
  help ease the anxiety you may feel about entering inpatient treatment. In this blog,
  we’ll walk through the intake experience and a typical day in drug and alcohol inpatient
  treatment at our Seattle treatment center.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Who
  Needs Inpatient Treatment?</strong></h2>\n<p>Inpatient rehab may be the right option
  if you’ve tried getting sober on your own without success, if you can’t function
  at work, school, or home, or if you can’t avoid the triggers to drink or use in
  your current environment. Inpatient treatment offers you the medical support and
  care you need to make recovery your sole focus.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What
  Happens in Residential Inpatient Treatment?</strong></h2>\n<p>At Lakeside-Milam
  Recovery Centers, the first step is to speak with our admissions team to discuss
  the issues. You may schedule a clinical addiction assessment with one of our skilled
  clinicians. During the assessment, you’ll talk with the clinician about how you’re
  functioning in your everyday life and how drug or alcohol use is affecting all areas
  of your life. This assessment usually takes between 60 and 90 minutes.  If the clinician
  determines that you meet the criteria for inpatient treatment, that recommendation
  will be made.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Admission</strong></h3>\n<p>If
  you decide to accept our clinician’s recommendation, you’ll schedule a day to be
  admitted. We know that people are often apprehensive and stressed about entering
  treatment, so we’ve made our admissions process as simple as possible.  Upon admission,
  you will meet with a nurse to assess if medical care is needed for withdrawal management
  (often referred to as detox).  You will meet treatment team members, and you’ll
  be assigned a treatment buddy. This is someone who is in inpatient treatment already.
  They’ll show you around the facility, introduce you to other patients, and tell
  you about the activities that make up the daily schedule.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Detox
  and Medically Managed Withdrawal</strong></h3>\n<p>Often, when people arrive to
  our Seattle treatment facility, they’re experiencing withdrawal from alcohol and/or
  drugs that requires withdrawal management, commonly referred to as detox. During
  detox, you’ll be cared for by our compassionate medical staff. If you need medication
  to help manage your withdrawal symptoms, the Medical Director or Nurse Practitioner
  will prescribe it. During detox, you’ll take part in the daily activities of the
  center as much as you’re able to.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Evaluations</strong></h3>\n<p>Within
  a few days of your arrival, you’ll get a thorough medical evaluation to find out
  what, if any, physical injury or damage you’ve sustained as a result of your addiction.
  We can share the results of this evaluation with your primary care physician if
  you choose. You’ll also meet with your assigned case manager. They’ll guide you
  through your course of treatment which can include mental health therapy, cognitive
  behavioral therapy, family education, and facilitate your daily group therapy sessions.
  You’ll subsequently meet with your case manager once a week to go over your progress
  and address any new issues that you’ve uncovered.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Daily
  Schedule</strong></h2>\n<p>In inpatient rehab, each day follows a similar schedule.
  In contrast to the chaos that substance use disorder can cause in your life, having
  a regular schedule provides much needed structure and stability. Many people also
  find that it reduces their anxiety to know what’s going to happen ahead of time.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3
  class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Morning Schedule</strong></h3>\n<p>Each day begins
  with a 15-minute meditation session. After meditation, it’s time for breakfast.
  Because healthy eating habits can fall to the wayside when you’re in active addiction,
  many people who enter treatment are malnourished. Our culinary staff prepares nutritious
  meals that will help you regain your physical health. If you have any dietary restrictions,
  we are happy to accommodate them. </p>\n<p>Once you’ve finished breakfast, it’s
  time for 24 Hour Reading. You’ll gather with your group and read out of the daily
  reflections book. This brings everyone together and helps set the tone for the day.</p>\n<p>After
  the 24 Hour Reading, you’ll attend a morning lecture.  Here, lectures aren’t like
  those you may remember from school. Morning lectures are educational discussions
  led by case managers, clinical coordinators, and recovery technicians. Topics run
  the gamut, from how nutrition can help in recovery to recognizing emotional defense
  mechanisms. From time to time, we also have guest lecturers who share their recovery
  stories. You’re encouraged to ask questions as you gain the knowledge you need to
  recover. </p>\n<p>On weekends the morning session is focused on the first three
  steps of 2 step recovery.  In a Step 1, 2, 3 Session, you’ll take a deep dive into
  each one of the 12 steps.  These sessions are led by someone who has completed inpatient
  treatment at Lakeside-Milam, so they’ve been in your shoes and can provide the insights
  and wisdom they’ve gained during and after treatment.</p>\n<p>Then, it’s time for
  Group Therapy. During this one-hour session, a counselor will lead your group as
  you discuss issues related to your substance use disorders and strategies for coping
  with those disorders. While talking about your issues in front of a bunch of strangers
  may sound intimidating, most people find group therapy very rewarding. You will
  likely end up forming lasting friendships with the members of your group.</p>\n<p>After
  Group Therapy, it’s time for lunch. Lunch is a great opportunity to nourish not
  just your body, but also your spirit by connecting with your peers in recovery.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3
  class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Afternoon Activities</strong></h3>\n<p>Once you’re
  done eating lunch, you’ll either attend an afternoon lecture or enjoy some recreational
  time.</p>\n<p>Afternoon lectures are similar to morning lectures. You’ll learn about
  everything from the neurobiology of addiction to foods to fight depression and anxiety.
  We believe that knowledge is power, so learning everything you can about the nature
  of substance use disorders is a crucial part of your recovery.</p>\n<p>Then it’s
  time for you afternoon group therapy session. Group therapy is a great way to get
  support and feedback from people who are going through a journey similar to yours.
  Sessions may be structured or more freeform, depending on the needs and goals of
  your group.</p>\n<p>Your schedule includes recreational time, which you can use
  to reconnect with nature by taking a walk on our beautiful walking path, enjoying
  a little fresh air in the outdoor courtyard, or just absorb the peace and quiet
  of our scenic campus. Or if you want to get a little exercise in, we have yoga mats
  and free weights available for you to use. You can also hang out and connect with
  your peers in one of the common areas.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>In
  the Evening</strong></h3>\n<p>After recreation, you’ll gather for dinner. The members
  of our culinary team are experts at preparing meals that are not only delicious,
  but also aid in your recovery by helping you build muscle and maintain a healthy
  weight. Dinner is also another opportunity to build community by connecting with
  your peers.</p>\n<p>After dinner, you can choose an activity that interests you,
  such as a scheduled yoga class. Or you can do whatever activity sounds good to you
  at the moment, including meditation, drawing, writing, reading, playing volleyball,
  exercising, or gathering with friends in a common area.</p>\n<p>Everyone at our
  Seattle treatment center attends a 12-step meeting of some kind for an hour each
  evening. The meeting you choose will depend on what type of use disorder you’re
  recovering from. Our experience is that people who involve themselves in 12-step
  programs are less likely to relapse, so this is a very important component of your
  treatment.</p>\n<p>After your 12-step meeting, it’s time for a snack. We end each
  day with a short meditation guided by one of your peers. Then it’s off to bed.</p>\n<p>There

A residential inpatient treatment center provides a structured and supportive environment for individuals seeking recovery from addiction. Daily life typically includes a balanced schedule of therapeutic activities, group therapy, individual counseling, and life skills training. Patients participate in various therapeutic modalities tailored to their needs, helping them address underlying issues contributing to their addiction.

Mornings often start with breakfast, followed by group sessions focused on topics such as coping strategies and relapse prevention. Individual therapy sessions allow for personalized attention and exploration of personal challenges. Afternoons generally include more group activities, such as recreational therapy and educational workshops.

Patients also engage in activities that promote physical well-being, such as exercise and mindfulness practices. The environment is designed to foster a sense of community and support among peers, encouraging open communication and shared experiences.

Family involvement is emphasized, with programs available to help loved ones understand addiction and support recovery. Overall, the daily routine at a residential inpatient treatment center is structured to facilitate healing and personal growth, providing patients with the tools they need for long-term recovery.
