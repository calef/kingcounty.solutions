  award recognizes their exceptional leadership in advancing behavioral health and
  crisis care throughout King County where they have been instrumental in advocating
  for increased funding, expanding mental health services, and improving crisis response
  systems in the region. The pair of elected officials from King County follow a 2023
  winner serving in the federal government, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy.\n\nMarc
  Oommen, Executive Director of NAMI Eastside, said, “Executive Constantine and Councilmember
  Perry embody the spirit of advocacy and community collaboration that NAMI Eastside
  stands for. Their tireless dedication to building a robust mental health infrastructure
  has made a profound difference in the lives of countless individuals and families
  affected by mental health challenges.”\n\nThe award presentation will take place
  during [NAMI Eastside’s Annual Gala and Fundraiser](https://nami-eastside.org/2024-gala/)
  on October 10, 2024, at the Seattle Marriott Redmond. The event brings together
  advocates, community leaders, and supporters to celebrate progress in mental health
  awareness and raise critical funds for support groups, mental health classes and
  presentations.\n\nThe “Healing Through Connection” gala, held on World Mental Health
  Day, is a fundraiser supporting NAMI Eastside’s mission to improve the lives of
  individuals and families affected by mental illness. Additional programming includes

  Surgeon General Vivek Murthy was awarded the 2023 Mental Health Champion Award for
  his focus on the importance of human connection and the crucial role it, along with
  community, can play in the healing process. The [2023 Luncheon theme](https://nami-eastside.org/luncheon2023/)
  was inspired by U.S. Surgeon General Vivek H. Murthy’s Advisory on Our Epidemic
  of Loneliness and Isolation and his book, “Together”.\n\nRecently, he has been in
  the news for warnings about the negative impacts on youth mental health that social
  media overuse can cause. This issue is important for youth and parents alike, and
  this year’s panel discussion at the gala will focus on that topic. How does social
  media and screentime affect young people? How much is too much? And what can parents
  do about it? We’ll go in-depth on the topic at this year’s gala.\n\nWe also hosted
  a forum on the same topic in September. Marcelle Waldman, the founder of FeelLinks,
  and Jerry Blackburn, Program Director at Empower Youth Network join NAMI Eastside
  for this live edition of their podcast, Parenting Upstream. The forum examined the
  link between teen social media use and rising rates of anxiety, depression and other
  mental health trends in youth.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/KEW4jcc_-eA?si=gpNGKCfbaGl8ng4A\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe
