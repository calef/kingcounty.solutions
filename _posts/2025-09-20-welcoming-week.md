East King County celebrated its annual Welcoming Week from September 12-21. The campaign encouraged mutual understanding between immigrants and non-immigrants through a series of events and activities, fostering a sense of belonging for all. This year's theme was "Stories We Tell". Among the events held in Redmond were a "Sweet Swap" at the Together Center, and "One Table, Many Stories" at the Redmond Senior and Community Center.
