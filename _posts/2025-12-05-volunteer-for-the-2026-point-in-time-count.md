The King County Regional Homelessness Authority (KCRHA) is seeking volunteers for the 2026 Point in Time Count, a vital initiative that assesses homelessness in the region. The count occurs every two years and provides important data on the number of people experiencing homelessness, helping to inform services and resources. Volunteers will help conduct surveys and gather information from individuals experiencing homelessness in various locations. This year's event will take place on Jan. 26, 2026. Interested individuals can sign up through the KCRHA website. Training sessions will be provided to prepare volunteers for their roles. The participation of community members is crucial for accurate data collection, which ultimately aids in addressing homelessness effectively. The KCRHA encourages people from all backgrounds to get involved and contribute to the well-being of the community by participating in this significant event.
