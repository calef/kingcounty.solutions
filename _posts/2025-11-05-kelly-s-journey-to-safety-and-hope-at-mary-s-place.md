Kelly arrived at Mary’s Place with her two sons, Cole and Jayce, after fleeing domestic violence, leaving behind their belongings. After exhausting her funds for a hotel stay, she faced the prospect of sleeping in her car until a stranger informed her about Mary’s Place, which offers emergency shelter and resources for homeless families. Upon arrival, they received warm meals and a sense of hope. The staff quickly assisted Kelly in creating a plan to escape her unsafe situation, including removing her name from a dangerous lease, connecting her with job workshops, and providing counseling for trauma recovery. Meanwhile, Cole and Jayce enjoyed safety and playtime in the Kids Club. Today, Kelly has secured a job as a receptionist at a dental office and is on the path to stable housing, marking a fresh start for her family after a period of fear and instability. Kelly's story highlights the importance of community support in helping families like hers find safety, stability, and hope through Mary’s Place.
