Stephanie Hockridge, co-founder of the lender service provider Blueacorn, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for her role in a fraudulent scheme that obtained over $63 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans. Hockridge, also known as Stephanie Reis, was found guilty of conspiracy to commit wire fraud after a jury trial. She and her co-conspirators submitted false PPP loan applications, fabricating documents such as payroll records and tax documentation, to secure larger loans for clients. They charged borrowers kickbacks based on the funds received and offered a service called “VIPPP” to assist clients in completing loan applications. In total, Hockridge processed more than $63 million in fraudulent loans. Along with her prison sentence, she was ordered to pay restitution of the same amount. The case was prosecuted by the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, which has been actively pursuing fraud schemes related to the PPP, with over 200 defendants prosecuted and more than $78 million in fraudulently obtained funds seized since the CARES Act was enacted.
