  # Former LCSNW employee, now volunteer, is a champion for immigrants

  Navigating the immigration system can be overwhelming, beyond simply starting a new life far from home. Immigrants come to the U.S. in search of safety, stability, and a chance to rebuild.

  That’s where dedicated LCSNW volunteers like Kinza Schuyler make all the difference. &nbsp;

  As a Department of Justice Accredited Immigration Representative, Kinza offers critical guidance to refugees and immigrants facing a maze of paperwork, deadlines, and legal uncertainty. With a thorough understanding of policy and a deep well of compassion, Kinza strives to help her clients go “from adversity to success.”&nbsp;&nbsp;

  Kinza found her passion for immigration through her work as Director of Operations for a small non-profit on the East Coast before moving to Seattle in the early 2000s. She volunteered for LCSNW for 2 ½ years before being hired to lead our immigration program in Seattle.&nbsp;

  In 2017, Kinza transitioned back to volunteering for Immigration Services at the SeaTac office. Since then, she has been a champion for her clients and believes that “when someone has nothing, the least you can do is honor them, respect them.”&nbsp;

  With a workload of over 200 cases, Kinza recently added a day of volunteering, upping it to three days a week. She sees her work as a puzzle that needs solving, and she strives to make it work for the person sitting in front of her.&nbsp;

  “Nothing makes you feel better than helping others,” Kinza said about volunteering.&nbsp;

  LCSNW is honored to have incredible volunteers like Kinza Schuyler, who help us carry out our mission of health, justice, and hope.&nbsp;

Former LCSNW employee Kinza Schuyler is now a dedicated volunteer, serving as a Department of Justice Accredited Immigration Representative. She provides essential support to immigrants and refugees navigating the complex U.S. immigration system, which often includes daunting paperwork and legal challenges. Kinza's commitment stems from her background as Director of Operations at a non-profit on the East Coast, leading her to discover her passion for immigration work when she moved to Seattle in the early 2000s. After volunteering with LCSNW for 2.5 years, she took on a leadership role in the immigration program before returning to volunteer status in 2017. Currently handling over 200 cases, Kinza has increased her volunteering to three days a week, viewing her role as a puzzle to solve for each individual client. She emphasizes the importance of honoring and respecting those who come to the U.S. seeking a better life, stating, “Nothing makes you feel better than helping others.” LCSNW celebrates the impactful contributions of volunteers like Kinza, who embody the organization's mission of health, justice, and hope.
