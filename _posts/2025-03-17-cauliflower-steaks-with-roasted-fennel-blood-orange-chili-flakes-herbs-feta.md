Cauliflower steaks are prepared by slicing two small heads of cauliflower into thick "steaks," which are then brushed with a mixture of olive oil, minced garlic, and spices, and roasted until golden and tender. Alongside, fennel is caramelized and combined with segments of blood orange, orange juice, and a mixture of vinegars and stock, creating a flavorful sauté. The dish is garnished with an herb salad made from shallots, assorted fresh herbs, and olive oil. To finish, the roasted cauliflower steaks are topped with the fennel-orange mixture, herb salad, fennel fronds, and crumbled feta cheese. This recipe serves 4-6 and highlights a vibrant blend of flavors, making it a unique and healthy option.
