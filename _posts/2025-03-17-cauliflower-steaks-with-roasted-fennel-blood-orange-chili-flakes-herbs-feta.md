  Yield: 4-6 servings

  ### Ingredients

  #### Herb Salad

  1/2 tablespoon of shallot or red onion, finely minced or shaved on a mandolin

  1-2 tablespoons red wine vinegar

  2 large handfuls of herbs of your choice (parsley, dill, mint, etc), washed and picked of the stem

  1-2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil

  Kosher salt, to taste

  Freshly ground pepper, to taste

  #### Cauliflower Steaks

  2 small cauliflower heads (about 1 1/2 pounds)

  1/3 - 1/2 cup olive oil

  3 cloves garlic

  Kosher salt, to taste

  1/4 teaspoon black pepper

  1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes

  1/2 teaspoon paprika, Aleppo, or sumac (or combination)

  1 teaspoon lemon zest or orange zest

  #### For the fennel

  2 fennel bulbs

  2 cara cara, blood, or navel oranges

  1/4 cup olive oil

  Flaky sea salt

  1/4 cup of fresh orange juice (about 1 large orange)

  1/4 cup of white grape juice or apple cider vinegar mixed with water

  1/4 cup of vegetable or chicken stock

  Pinch of crushed red pepper flakes

  Pinch of Aleppo pepper flakes or sumac

  Freshly ground black pepper, to taste

  Pinch of fennel pollen (optional)

  Feta, to garnish

  ### Instruction

  #### For the Herb Salad

  Toss the shallot or onion with the vinegar and allow to sit to mellow out the bite of the allium. When ready to serve, add picked herbs, olive oil, along with salt and pepper. Toss to combine and taste for seasoning.

  #### Cooking the cauliflower steaks

  Mince the garlic. Then transfer it to a small bowl along with the oil, salt, spices, and citrus zest. Mix well and reserve to brush on the steaks.

  Preheat the oven to 400 - 420 degrees.

  Slice away the thick protruding cauliflower stem to create a flat base so it can sit level on your cutting board.

  Then, use a sharp knife to slice the cauliflower head into steak-like slices. The thinnest recommended is 3/4 of an inch. Reserve any small bits put into the oven as well to get crispy.

  Place steaks on a parchment-lined baking tray. Using a pastry or silicone brush, liberally brush both sides of the cauliflower steaks with your marinated oil. Roast for 25 minutes in the oven, flipping halfway as an option. The roasted cauliflower steaks are ready when they’re tender in the middle and golden-brown and crisp outside.

  While they are cooking, prepare the fennel.

  #### For the Fennel

  Cut the fennel bulbs into wedges. Cut the stems into thin slices, reserving the fronds. Set aside.

  Section both oranges by cutting off both ends. Set it on one end, and use a paring knife to cut away the peel and the pith in strips, starting at the top and following the curves to the bottom. Then, holding the orange in one hand, carefully insert the blade of the knife between the flesh and the membrane to cut out the sections without any membrane attached. The sections should come out easily.

  In a large frying pan over high heat, warm the oil. Add the fennel wedges, using tongs to place the cut sides against the pan bottom to get a good sear. Cook until the fennel is caramelized for about 3 minutes. Flip, lower heat to medium-high and cook on the other side until caramelized, another 3 minutes. Season with salt, toss in the fennel stems and continue to cook until the stems are well browned, another 2 minutes. Add the orange juice, grape juice or apple cider vinegar, and stock and let reduce until the sauce is thickened, and the fennel is deeply seared and start to soften, 3-4 minutes. Add the red pepper flakes, sumac, and Aleppo and season with lots of salt and pepper.

  Reserve until your steaks are done. Then pile onto your steaks, garnish with fennel fronds, orange segments, herb salad, fennel pollen (if using), and feta. Serve warm or at room temperature

Cauliflower steaks are prepared by slicing two small heads of cauliflower into thick "steaks," which are then brushed with a mixture of olive oil, minced garlic, and spices, and roasted until golden and tender. Alongside, fennel is caramelized and combined with segments of blood orange, orange juice, and a mixture of vinegars and stock, creating a flavorful sauté. The dish is garnished with an herb salad made from shallots, assorted fresh herbs, and olive oil. To finish, the roasted cauliflower steaks are topped with the fennel-orange mixture, herb salad, fennel fronds, and crumbled feta cheese. This recipe serves 4-6 and highlights a vibrant blend of flavors, making it a unique and healthy option.
