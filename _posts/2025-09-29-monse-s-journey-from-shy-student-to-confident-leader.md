Monse, a high school junior, transformed from a shy student into a confident leader through her involvement with Juma, which offers flexible employment opportunities for students. Initially working alongside her brother, Monse appreciated the autonomy provided by Juma, allowing her to create a work schedule that balanced her educational commitments. Supported by her Enterprise Managers, she gained confidence and leadership skills, as Juma offered guidance on college preparation topics not covered in school. Monse engaged in activities to enhance her resume, practice interviews, and apply for scholarships, all while developing practical skills through her work in stadiums. As she progressed, she helped Juma's Enterprise team design a system for newly promoted youth leaders, realizing her capability to guide peers. Monse now serves as a Juma Youth Manager, mentoring new participants to build their confidence. Concurrently, she is pursuing an Associate’s degree at De Anza College and works at Juma’s enterprises, aspiring to a career in architecture.
