title: Traumatic events in communities can make organizations more risk-averse

New research from the University of Washington reveals that violent traumatic events in communities, such as mass shootings, significantly reduce organizational risk-taking. This study, published in the Academy of Management Journal, challenges the notion that decision-makers are purely rational and unaffected by external emotional states. It demonstrates that emotional experiences in the community can influence workplace decisions, leading to a decreased focus on ambitious goals. 

The research combined an observational field study of nearly 40,000 NFL fourth-down decisions from 2008 to 2019 with data on local violent incidents. Teams that typically took more risks when underperforming became less likely to attempt risky plays after nearby traumatic events. The impact of these events was stronger for decision-makers more embedded in their communities, with proximity influencing risk behavior significantly. 

Additionally, controlled experiments confirmed that exposure to narratives of traumatic events led participants to take fewer risks in competitive scenarios, reflecting a decline in their competitive drive. This study highlights the profound interconnectedness of societal trauma and organizational decision-making, suggesting that collective emotional states can subtly influence strategic behaviors across various sectors.
