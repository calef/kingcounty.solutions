  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">The research team found that violent traumatic events in local communities make decision-makers less focused on pursuing lofty objectives. As a result, organizations become less likely to take risky actions to close  performance gaps or achieve ambitious goals.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">To reach these conclusions, the researchers combined two complementary methods: an observational field study and two controlled experiments. The field study analyzed nearly 40,000 fourth-down decisions made by NFL teams between 2008 and 2019 and combined that data with information on local mass shootings and other violent events.</span></p>
  <p><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23443815"><span style="font-weight: 400">Previous research shows</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> that when NFL teams fall behind in games, they tend to take more risks — for example, attempting a fourth-down conversion rather than punting or trying for a field goal.

However, following a traumatic event nearby, those same teams were 10% less likely to take that risk.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think it is a sadness effect,” Gupta said. “When people are sad, they can&#8217;t focus on pursuing their ambitious goals.

These traumatic events impair people’s ability to pursue those goals.”</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Researchers also found that when the chief decision maker — the coach, in this case — had spent more time embedded in the community, the event’s impact on risk-taking behavior increased.

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was striking that distance still matters,” Gupta said. “You think it wouldn’t matter with the way information spreads now, but even two miles versus 20 miles still really matters. When it&#8217;s that close, you can imagine yourself or your kids being the target. Rationally, it shouldn’t matter, but psychologically, it clearly does.”</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two controlled experiments verified the mechanism behind the behavior changes.

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">By demonstrating that emotionally charged events in the broader social environment can alter organizational risk-taking, the study highlights the deep interconnectivity between societal trauma and economic decision-making.

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Emotional states are dynamic, fleeting, and hard to study,” Gupta said. “How they influence important organizational decisions is still an underexplored area.

  Violent traumatic events — such as mass shootings and acts of domestic terrorism — have become increasingly common in the United States. Yet, despite their growing prevalence, little research has examined how these events shape the decisions made within organizations.

  A new study from the University of Washington, [recently published](https://journals.aom.org/doi/epub/10.5465/amj.2023.0306) in the Academy of Management Journal, reveals that traumatic events can significantly dampen organizational risk-taking. The findings challenge the long-standing view that decision-makers — such as CEOs, executives and team leaders — are largely rational, emotionless actors. The research instead shows that emotional experiences in the broader community can spill over into the workplace and reshape strategic choices.

  “People bring their whole selves to work,” said [Abhinav Gupta](https://foster.uw.edu/faculty-research/directory/abhinav-gupta/), co-author and professor of management in the UW Foster School of Business. “Whatever emotional state that’s being influenced by things happening in their community eventually spills over and bleeds into how organizations conduct themselves.”

  The research team found that violent traumatic events in local communities make decision-makers less focused on pursuing lofty objectives. As a result, organizations become less likely to take risky actions to close&nbsp; performance gaps or achieve ambitious goals.

  To reach these conclusions, the researchers combined two complementary methods: an observational field study and two controlled experiments.

However, following a traumatic event nearby, those same teams were 10% less likely to take that risk.

title: Traumatic events in communities can make organizations more risk-averse
topics: []

New research from the University of Washington reveals that violent traumatic events in communities, such as mass shootings, significantly reduce organizational risk-taking. This study, published in the *Academy of Management Journal*, challenges the notion that decision-makers are purely rational and unaffected by external emotional states. It demonstrates that emotional experiences in the community can influence workplace decisions, leading to a decreased focus on ambitious goals.

The research combined an observational field study of nearly 40,000 NFL fourth-down decisions from 2008 to 2019 with data on local violent incidents. Teams that typically took more risks when underperforming became less likely to attempt risky plays after nearby traumatic events. The impact of these events was stronger for decision-makers more embedded in their communities, with proximity significantly influencing risk behavior.

Additionally, controlled experiments confirmed that exposure to narratives of traumatic events led participants to take fewer risks in competitive scenarios, reflecting a decline in their competitive drive. This study highlights the profound interconnectedness of societal trauma and organizational decision-making, suggesting that collective emotional states can subtly influence strategic behaviors across various sectors.
