  <p><strong>What is the role of a primary care provider in breast cancer screening?</strong><br>Primary care providers (PCP) help you stay up to date on the latest cancer screening guidelines. At your annual check-up, they’ll talk about your family history, cancer risks, and personal health to decide what screenings are right for you. They also remind patients about screenings and encourage them to check their MyChart for health maintenance updates, including cancer screenings.</p>



  <p><strong>What is the role of a radiologist when viewing mammograms?</strong><br>The radiologist checks the mammogram for any signs of breast cancer. They also work with other healthcare providers to answer questions and address concerns about the results.</p>



  <p><strong>What are the current guidelines for breast cancer screening?</strong><br>For most women, the recommendation is to start getting mammograms at age 40, every 1 to 2 years. At Valley, we recommend yearly mammograms starting at age 40.</p>



  <p><strong>How common is breast cancer?</strong><br>About 1 in 8 women (or 13%) in the U.S. will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime. It’s the second most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in women.</p>



  <p><strong>What are the latest guidelines for doing breast self-exams?</strong><br>Currently, there&#8217;s no strong evidence  that clinical breast exams or self-breast exams improve breast cancer detection. However, it’s important to be familiar with how your breasts normally look and feel. If you notice changes like lumps, skin changes, discharge, or one breast looking different than the other, talk to your PCP as soon as you’re able.</p>



  <p><strong>What does it mean if your mammogram report notes you have dense breasts?</strong><br>Breast density refers to how much fatty tissue versus glandular (milk-producing) tissue is in your breasts. Some women have mostly fatty tissue, while others have more glandular tissue. The more fatty tissue you have, the less dense the breast tissue is, and the easier the mammogram is to read. For women who have dense breast tissue (more than 50% glandular),they  have a slightly higher risk of getting breast cancer compared to women with all fatty tissue. And also, there are more places that a developing breast cancer could hide.</p>



  <p><strong>What should I expect during a breast imaging appointment?</strong><br>At Valley’s Breast Center, we want you to feel comfortable and respected. You’ll be given a hospital gown, and a technologist will take images of each breast. These images are then sent to a radiologist to review.</p>



  <p><strong>What’s the difference between a screening and a diagnostic mammogram?</strong><br>A screening mammogram is for women who aren’t having any symptoms—it’s just a routine check. A diagnostic mammogram is for women who have symptoms like lumps, nipple discharge, skin changes, or if something unusual was found on a screening mammogram.</p>



  <p><strong>How will I get my mammogram results?</strong><br>For screening mammograms, results are sent by letter, email, or through MyChart. If something unusual is found, someone from the Breast Center will contact you to schedule more tests. For diagnostic mammograms, you’ll get your results the same day, either from the radiologist or the technologist.</p>



  <p><strong>How can I schedule a mammogram?</strong><br>You can schedule a screening or diagnostic mammogram through <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://valleymed.org/mychart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MyChart </a></span></strong>or by calling the Breast Center directly at 425.690.3688. We have two locations: one in Renton at the hospital main campus (for screening and diagnostic mammograms) and one in Covington (for both screening mammograms).</p>

Breast cancer screening guidelines recommend that most women begin mammograms at age 40, with Valley Medical Center suggesting annual screenings. Primary care providers play a crucial role by discussing personal health, family history, and cancer risks during annual check-ups, while radiologists analyze mammograms for signs of cancer and collaborate with healthcare providers to address results. Approximately 13% of women in the U.S. will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime, making it the second most common cancer among females. While clinical breast exams and self-exams are not proven to significantly enhance detection rates, women should be familiar with their breasts and report any noticeable changes to their PCP. Dense breast tissue, indicated in mammogram reports, suggests a higher risk for breast cancer due to the increased presence of glandular tissue. During a breast imaging appointment, patients can expect a comfortable environment where technologists take images for radiologists to review. Results from screening mammograms are typically communicated via letter, email, or MyChart, while diagnostic results are provided on the same day. Appointments can be scheduled through MyChart or by calling the Breast Center.
