  **_“When the world implodes and explodes… you can either stay the course the best
  you can, or adapt and evolve.”_**\n\nDear Friends,\n\nI spoke those words in[our
  video celebrating 15 years of Resilience and Renewal.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwnPCcB0Yn4)
  At that moment, I was reflecting on the 2020 pandemic. It’s remarkable to think
  that five years have passed since our country and region was transformed by profound
  events like COVID-19, which changed how we work, connect, and navigate the world,
  and the killing of George Floyd, which ignited a long-overdue racial reckoning.\n\nI
  remember those days vividly – how we[opened Helen’s Place](https://sophiaway.org/kirkland-place/),
  doubling our capacity and expanding our services to provide shelter and safety to
  more women. How we, as a community – staff, donors, and supporters – strengthened
  our resolve to ensure the women we serve had what they needed. We found new opportunities
  and seized them. We reinforced our commitment to providing shelter, safety, and
  stability for women.\n\nAnd now, once again, we find ourselves in uncertain times.
  A new presidential administration is aiming to leave its mark on the world. Many
  of us feel the turbulence of shifting policies and decisions that are arriving at
  a seemingly relentless pace, leaving little time to catch our breath before the
  next change unfolds.\n\nIn these moments, I return to my words: **We WILL adapt
  and evolve.**\n\n**We WILL continue** to stand with women as they journey from homelessness
  to safe and stable lives.\n\n**We WILL draw strength** from[our values](https://sophiaway.org/about/)
  – welcoming, compassionate, inclusive, and supportive – ensuring every woman we
  serve is cared for with dignity and respect.\n\nOur board, staff and I reaffirm
  our dedication to being a place of hope and change for women experiencing homelessness.
  And we trust our community to walk alongside us, ensuring every woman we serve finds
  the safety and stability she deserves.\n\nAnd, should any policies or changes directly
  affect our work, I will communicate openly and transparently about their impact.\n\nI
  know you will stand with us, wrapping our arms and hearts around those who need
  us most.\n\nAs our late founder, Helen Leuzzi, said when this organization was taking
  shape, _“It just inspires me to see… they keep on going…”_\n\nAnd we will!\n\nWith
  gratitude,\n\nDietra Clayton  \n_Executive Director_\n\n> \n\nThe post [We Will
  Adapt & Evolve](https://sophiaway.org/adapt-and-evolve/) first appeared on [The
