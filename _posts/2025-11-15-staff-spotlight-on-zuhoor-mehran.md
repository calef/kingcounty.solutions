Zuhoor Mehran joined the MSC team in 2023 as a Community Outreach Specialist in the Immigrant and Refugee Outreach and Community Education Program. Her program provides culturally and linguistically appropriate support to newly arrived refugees and immigrants, helping them adjust to their new environment. This includes connecting clients to essential resources such as housing assistance, employment, legal support, and educational resources, which aid in achieving self-sufficiency and successful settlement.

One notable client experience involved a refugee family where the mother, after ear surgery, lost her job, while her husband was seeking employment. Zuhoor referred them to a local organization for rental assistance, helped them apply for energy assistance, and connected them to employment resources. They received three months of rental assistance, credit on their electricity account, and both secured jobs.

Zuhoor finds great satisfaction in witnessing her clients’ transformations as they overcome challenges and become more confident and independent. Her motivation stems from the desire to help those in need of basic resources, believing that even small efforts can lead to meaningful change. Outside of work, she enjoys spending time with family and friends and exploring Washington’s hiking trails.
