Today, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana ended the consent decree governing the New Orleans Police Department (NOPD), concluding federal oversight established in 2013. This decision was made following a joint motion by the Justice Department and the City of New Orleans, highlighting NOPD's successful reforms in areas such as use of force, crisis intervention, and stops, searches, and arrests. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon praised the NOPD for its sustained progress in constitutional policing, acknowledging the commitment of officers and supervisors despite local challenges. Acting U.S. Attorney Michael M. Simpson noted that the reforms have positively impacted community safety and the effectiveness of the police department. The consent decree stemmed from a 2012 Justice Department investigation, which revealed a pattern of constitutional violations by NOPD. A sustainment plan approved in January 2025 ensured the continuation of these reforms. The conclusion of the NOPD case is significant as it represents the seventh police reform matter resolved by the Justice Department in 2025, reflecting ongoing efforts to implement reforms that enhance law enforcement practices nationwide.
