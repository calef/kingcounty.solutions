Mini City Hall has partnered with PIM Savvy to introduce new free services, including assistance with King County property tax exemption applications and conversational English classes. The property tax exemption support is particularly beneficial for qualifying homeowners, such as seniors and individuals with disabilities on fixed incomes, providing step-by-step guidance to simplify the application process. The English language classes aim to help community members enhance their everyday communication skills in a welcoming environment. These classes will be held virtually and in-person twice a month, allowing participants to engage in a manner that suits them best, with sessions designed to foster a friendly atmosphere for practicing conversations. Classes are scheduled for the second and fourth Wednesday of each month from 10:15 to 11 a.m., with early registration recommended due to limited space. Located in Crossroads Shopping Center, Mini City Hall offers convenient access to city services and community programs in multiple languages, ensuring all residents feel supported. This partnership enables Mini City Hall to better serve the community by providing resources in an accessible and familiar setting. For more information, residents can contact Mini City Hall directly.
