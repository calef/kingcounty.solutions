State health officials have suspended the license of Jeremiah Shane Dunlap, a substance use disorder professional in Pierce County, due to serious allegations including sexual misconduct. Dunlap, who was the CEO of Rainier Recovery, is accused of making inappropriate remarks to employees, allowing trainees to work unsupervised, altering patient records to change clinical assessments and urinalysis results, and retaliating against employees who refused to comply with his directives. Additionally, he is charged with providing substandard care that allegedly contributed to a patient's death. The suspension is aimed at protecting public health and patient safety, and Dunlap has 20 days to request a hearing to contest the charges. Legal documents related to the case are available online, and individuals who believe a health care provider has acted unprofessionally are encouraged to report their concerns. The Department of Health is responsible for regulating health care providers in Washington to ensure quality and safety in health services.
