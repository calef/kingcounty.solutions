The City of Medina is implementing sidewalk vegetation management to maintain safe pedestrian pathways, focusing on main roads such as Evergreen Point Road and NE 8th Street. Property owners are responsible for keeping the adjacent right-of-way clear of overgrown vegetation, as outlined in the Medina Municipal Code. Ensuring sidewalks are free from overhanging vegetation is crucial for community safety. Residents can contact Ryan Osada, the Public Works Director, for assistance or more information.
