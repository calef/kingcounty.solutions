Tenisha Joseph, talent manager at Reading Partners, reflects on her transformative relationship with reading. Her earliest memory is from Pre-K, where her teacher, Ms. Flood, captivated her class with storytelling. Joseph loved "The Rainbow Fish" for its beautiful illustrations and meaningful lessons about friendship and happiness. As she grew, her reading preferences evolved toward more complex themes, focusing on character development and diverse perspectives.

Joseph highlights several children's books that she wishes had existed during her childhood, including "Hair Love" by Matthew A. Cherry, which celebrates Black hair and family bonds, and "Sulwe" by Lupita Nyong’o, promoting self-acceptance and beauty. She also appreciates "I Am Enough" by Grace Byers for encouraging resilience and confidence, and "All Because You Matter" by Tami Charles, which reassures children of their inherent worth.

Joseph believes that literature empowers young students by providing representation, fostering empathy, and offering emotional support. She emphasizes that stories help children navigate their feelings, build confidence, and develop a broader worldview, making reading a powerful tool for personal growth and connection.
