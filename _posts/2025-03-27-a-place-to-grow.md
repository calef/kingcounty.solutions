The After-School Program provides local youth with a supportive environment to build meaningful relationships, engage in enriching activities, and complete homework. Guided by dedicated Youth Coordinators, children enjoy outdoor play, snacks, and continued learning after school hours. Operating in line with the Seattle school calendar, the program takes a summer break but culminates in an annual moving-on ceremony to celebrate participants' achievements. Families are invited to enjoy performances, barbecues, and speeches from the children, showcasing their personal growth throughout the year. One participant, Moses, expressed his appreciation for the program, stating, “I love ASC because it helps me build grown-up skills!” His experience exemplifies the program's impact, as he has developed his talents and confidence, participating in activities like the Slam Poetry Night. This nurturing environment fosters fearlessness and personal development, helping children thrive both socially and academically.
