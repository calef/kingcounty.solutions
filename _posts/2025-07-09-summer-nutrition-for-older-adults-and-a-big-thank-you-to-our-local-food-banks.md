As summer progresses, Eastside Friends of Seniors emphasizes the importance of nutrition for older adults, highlighting how good eating habits support strength, energy, and independence. Staying hydrated and incorporating seasonal fruits and vegetables—such as strawberries, blueberries, and cucumbers—can significantly enhance well-being. Local food banks play a critical role in providing access to fresh produce and essential pantry items, making healthy choices more accessible for seniors. The organization extends gratitude to local food banks and their volunteers, whose efforts ensure that older adults have ongoing access to nutritious food.

In addition to acknowledging food banks, Eastside Friends of Seniors offers resources like nutrition guidance and simple recipes using food bank ingredients. They suggest that small dietary changes can help older adults maintain a healthy weight, support bone and joint health, manage blood sugar levels, and boost energy. Community members are encouraged to donate fresh produce, shelf-stable items, or volunteer to support these vital services. For additional information on nutrition and support services for seniors, the organization invites outreach from those in need.
