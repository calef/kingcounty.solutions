King County Executive Shannon Braddock has proposed a biennial budget for 2026–2027 totaling $19.7 billion, aimed at preventing significant cuts to critical services while enhancing investments in public safety, housing, homelessness response, and behavioral health. The budget addresses a $175 million General Fund shortfall and utilizes a new criminal justice sales tax to safeguard services in the Sheriff’s Office, Prosecutor’s Office, and public health sectors. Key elements include $175 million for public safety staff, nearly $30 million for improving the justice system, and $5 million to maintain the SoDo shelter. Additionally, $4 million is earmarked to increase food security, while $31 million is allocated to protect healthcare against potential federal funding cuts. The budget also proposes restoring over 400,000 hours of bus service and enhancing various transit options. Emphasizing accountability, $10 million is designated for financial management improvements, and nearly $3 million for developing an Artificial Intelligence policy. Executive Braddock's budget aims to create a sustainable and effective framework for King County, with final approval expected in November after public review.
