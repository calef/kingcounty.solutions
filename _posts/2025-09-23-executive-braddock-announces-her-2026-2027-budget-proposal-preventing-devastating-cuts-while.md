  Braddock to support significant new funding to combat hunger in King County. This
  work is more important than ever as federal government cuts and rising prices have
  sent more of our residents to food banks. No one in King County should go hungry,
  and I am grateful for Executive Braddock’s commitment to this work. We will carefully
  review this budget, work to ensure transparency and accountability for all spending,
  and pass this budget on time to ensure stability and continuity of King County programs
  and services.”</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NBCD4yBqqZ_y5yK03TfV3g.png"
