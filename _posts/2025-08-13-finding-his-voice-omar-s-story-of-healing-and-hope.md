Omar, a young man from El Salvador, faced relentless bullying throughout his childhood due to a physical difference affecting one of his ears. This led to deep emotional pain, panic attacks, and a strained relationship with his father, who viewed vulnerability as weakness. To cope, Omar suppressed his feelings and resorted to self-harm. On New Year’s Eve 2022, he resolved to change his life after feeling isolated during celebrations. Encouraged by a friend, he sought help from Youth Eastside Services (YES), where he met a bilingual counselor. This marked a turning point for Omar, as he began to unpack years of trauma through poetry. His first poem, "The Invisible Kid," allowed him to express his loneliness and recognize his past pain. Now studying to be a dental hygienist and on the National Dean's List, Omar embraces his emotions, shares his poetry on social media, and helps others feel less alone. He acknowledges that while sadness still exists, he has learned to process his feelings in healthier ways, marking a significant journey of healing and self-acceptance. The support of donors has been crucial in providing such transformative services to youth like Omar.
