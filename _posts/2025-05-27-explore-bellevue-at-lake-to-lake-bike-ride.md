topics: []
---

The 12th annual Lake to Lake Bike Ride will be held on Saturday, June 14, offering cyclists of all skill levels a chance to explore Bellevue. Participants can choose from three routes: a nine-mile flat loop ideal for families, a 24-mile loop with some climbs, and a free kids ride in the park. Registration is recommended due to limited space, with on-site registration available from 8:30 to 9 a.m. Both adult rides will commence between 9 and 10 a.m. at Robinswood Park, while the kids ride, for ages three to eight, starts at 12:15 p.m. Riders under 18 must be accompanied by an adult, and the routes feature low-traffic roads, bike lanes, and gravel trails, supported by staff until noon. The event includes random prize drawings, refreshments, and freebies for all participants. The cost is $20 per rider for preregistration and $24 on the day of the event. Proceeds will support the City of Bellevue Youth Program Donation Fund. Title sponsors include Imagine Housing and Overlake Medical Center, with additional support from local organizations. For more information, participants can call or email the provided contacts.
