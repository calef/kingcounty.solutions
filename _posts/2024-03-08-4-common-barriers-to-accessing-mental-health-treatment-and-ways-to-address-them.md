original_content: "If you are struggling with your mental health, finding a therapist
  can feel like a monumental task. There are a lot of steps that can be difficult
  to navigate when you are already feeling overwhelmed or in a crisis state. We’ve
  been there too, and we see you. Having a better understanding of the process of
  finding a therapist can help.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nAt Crisis Connections, we have several
  programs designed to offer emotional support over our call/text/chat lines. Our
  services are not meant as a replacement for mental health counseling to those who
  want access to it, but we are here for you every day, 24 hours a day, and outside
  of therapists’ office hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nMany of our callers are looking to connect
  with long-term treatment, and a number of obstacles can make that intimidating.
  Here are some tips for navigating four common obstacles we see:&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n1.
  _I don’t know where to start.&nbsp;_&nbsp;\n\n1. _I can’t afford this.&nbsp;_&nbsp;\n\n1.
  _I don’t know how to find a therapist I trust or who can help me_.&nbsp;\n\n1. _None
  of the therapists I like are available right now._&nbsp;\n\n* * *\n\n1. &nbsp;_I
  don’t know where to start.&nbsp;_&nbsp;\n\nThere are a lot of elements involved
  in looking for the right therapist—it gets overwhelming, fast. The process for finding
  a therapist varies from person, but here are some things to consider to help you
  narrow down your search.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n- Identify what you want to work on in therapy.&nbsp;
  \ \n\n  - Different therapists specialize in different areas of mental health care;
  understanding the kind of support you are looking for can help you find the right
  therapist for you, and for both of you to know what to start to work on.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  \ \n\n- Considering cost, with and without insurance. &nbsp;  \n\n  - Some insurance
  companies have search engines you can use to find providers, which can streamline
  your search process by enabling you to search all the providers in your area covered
  by your insurance and use the filters to narrow down the options. Look on their
  websites for behavioral health to find more specific information about what they
  will cover.&nbsp;&nbsp;  \n  \n  - If you do not have insurance, look for sliding
  scale and lower cost options using 211’s search engine (more information about this
  process later).&nbsp;&nbsp;  \n\n- Use a search engine or directory to find a few
  prospective therapists. You can use 211 or your insurance’s website/list of providers,
  or check out of the more specialized directories below:&nbsp;&nbsp;  \n\n  - [Therapy
  For Black Girls](https://therapyforblackgirls.com/)&nbsp;\n  - [Home – National
  Queer and Trans Therapists of Color Network (nqttcn.com)](https://nqttcn.com/en/)&nbsp;\n
  \ - [Find a Therapist, Psychologist, Counselor – Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists)&nbsp;\n
  \ - [Latinx Therapy](https://latinxtherapy.com/)&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  - [Multicultural

  Transgender, Nonbinary, Neurodivergent, Disabled communities: BIPOC & LGBTQ affirming
  therapists, coaches, counselors, psychologists, psychiatrists near me, virtual,
  telehealth](https://www.inclusivetherapists.com/)&nbsp;  \n\n- Send inquiries via
  email to prospective therapists.&nbsp;&nbsp;  \n\n  - Introduce yourself and what
  you are looking to work on in therapy, ask about their availability and set up a
  time to talk with them on the phone to assess if they are the right therapist for
  you.&nbsp;  \n&nbsp;  \n  - Make a template for yourself—you do not have to make
  a custom email every time!  \n&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n- Additional info at [How to Find
  a Therapist | Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/therapy/how-to-find-a-therapist)&nbsp;
  \ \n\n1. _I can’t afford this.&nbsp;_&nbsp;\n\nOne of the biggest barriers to accessing
  treatment is its cost. Resource directories often have tabs that can help navigate
  this and filter for the options that work for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nThe [Resource
  Directory | Washington 211 (wa211.org)](https://search.wa211.org/), for example,
  lets you enter your location, search for services near you, and filter for places
  that specifically offer low-cost or sliding scale therapy.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n![](https://www.crisisconnections.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/image-1.png)\n\nThere
  are also tabs that allow you to search based on the languages you speak, your age,
  and your demographic (“focus population”). If you are having trouble navigating
  the search engine or need additional support, reach out to 211 by dialing 2-1-1,
  texting the same number, or emailing via [Contact | Washington 211 (wa211.org)](https://wa211.org/contact-washington-211/#form)
  .&nbsp;  \n  \nThrough 211, you can also find resources to help navigate transportation
  and its surrounding costs. If transportation is an issue, there are many online
  options available through all the directories.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n1. _I don’t know how
  to find a therapist I trust or who can help me_.&nbsp;\n\nIt’s important to find
  a therapist who makes you feel comfortable and seen, but finding the right fit can
  be tiring and frustrating. There are ways to ease the process and when you do find
  the right match, it can be well worth it.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nBefore you decide on a
  therapist, it helps to have a conversation with them and ask some questions about
  their philosophy and the types of treatment they offer. This article from Psychology
  Today outlines some potential questions: [How to Find the Right Therapist | Psychology
  Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/finding-new-home/202001/how-find-the-right-therapist).&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nWhen
  you have your first phone call with the therapist, you can ask them some of these
  questions. Going into this conversation, it is helpful to have an idea of what you
  are looking for from their answers. While you are talking to them, think about how
  the conversation feels—do you like the initial dynamics? Do you feel comfortable
  around them? You want to make sure you work with someone you can trust, and who
  understands your goals.\n\n1. _None of the therapists I like are available right
  now._&nbsp;\n\nSometimes the therapist you want to work with has a waitlist or doesn’t
  fit your availability. This can be disheartening—sometimes it feels like nothing
  is happening when you are on a waitlist and you need support now.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n**While

Crisis Connections has outlined four common obstacles people face when accessing mental health treatment and provided tips for addressing them. These barriers include not knowing where to start, affordability concerns, finding a trustworthy therapist, and unavailability of preferred therapists. To address these, the organization suggests identifying personal therapy goals, considering cost with and without insurance, using a search engine or directory to find prospective therapists, and sending inquiries via email. For those struggling with cost, resources such as the Resource Directory or 211 can help find low-cost or sliding scale therapy options. Additionally, Crisis Connections provides several 24/7 services for immediate emotional support.
