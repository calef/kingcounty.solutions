Bellwether Housing has announced the sale of Vine Court Apartments in Belltown following a devastating fire in July 2024 that made the building uninhabitable and resulted in the loss of two residents. After a year of assessing repair costs and negotiating with insurers, Bellwether concluded that rebuilding expenses significantly exceeded available insurance funds. Vine Court was Bellwether's first ground-up construction, housing 55 lower-income single-adult households since 1989. In the wake of the fire, Bellwether prioritized the relocation of residents, assisting many in finding affordable housing within its portfolio and providing hotel accommodations and financial support. CEO Susan Boyd expressed pride in the organization’s support for residents and gratitude for community partners during this transition. Despite the sale, Bellwether maintains a strong presence in Belltown, operating 274 affordable homes in the area and 674 in other parts of downtown Seattle and South Lake Union. Bellwether is actively expanding, with six development projects underway in Seattle, Redmond, and Bellevue, aiming to add over 1,500 affordable apartment homes in the next five years to address the regional housing needs.
