Join Temple Morris, LCSW-C, and Dr. Brian Pilecki, PhD, as they engage in a deep conversation with Opal Co-Founders Kara Bazzi, LMFT, and Dr. Lexi Giblin, PhD, exploring the therapeutic potential of psychedelics. The discussion aims to articulate experiences often deemed "beyond language," highlighting how psychedelics can aid in clarifying what truly matters and enhancing psychological flexibility. Key topics include the characteristics of psychedelic experiences, the significance of integration work, the risks associated with psychedelic use, and their potential role in treating eating disorders and body image issues. The conversation serves as a valuable resource for understanding the complexities and benefits of psychedelics in a therapeutic context.
