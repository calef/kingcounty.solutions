More than 200 girls from Zambia, Malawi, and Zimbabwe participated in CAMFED’s STEM camps, held in August 2025. These camps, co-hosted with local Ministries of Education and the National Inventors Hall of Fame, aimed to inspire girls from rural communities to explore careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Participants engaged in hands-on activities, including inventing items and presenting prototypes, fostering creativity and problem-solving skills.

The camps also provided opportunities for networking among like-minded young innovators facing similar challenges. CAMFED emphasized the importance of nurturing curiosity and building confidence, with modules that included themes like space exploration. The camps concluded with a cultural celebration, allowing students to showcase traditional dances, songs, and clothing.

Government officials highlighted their commitment to expanding STEM opportunities for girls, aligning with educational priorities to enhance technology-driven programs. CAMFED aims to close the gender gap in STEM fields and encourage more girls to pursue higher education and careers in these areas, reinforcing their role as future leaders in innovation and development.
