  <p><em>We have traditionally created a Fall newsletter to communicate to current and alumni Changes members, as well as to the community at large.  </em></p>
  <p><em>With the creation of this website blog, we are moving from periodic newsletter-style communication to a more regular as-needed rhythm.  So consider this to be a delayed part 1 of what would have been our Fall ’24 Changing Times newsletter.  </em></p>
  <p><em>Karen Gustafson is stepping down from her role as President of our Board of Directors.  We are grateful for her three years of leadership, which occurred during a period of the greatest amount of change in Changes’ history. We are thankful and inspired that she will continue to dedicate time to Changes in a variety of other ways.  Here’s Karen in her own words.</em></p>
  <p>__________________________________________________________________________________</p>
  <p>The title “President, Changes Board of Directors” sounds stately and commanding but it’s largely an administrative role.  The real power in Changes lies, as it always has, with our individual members and their unique contributions.  During my three years as Board president, I had the immeasurable gift of working with a Board composed of some of the most stellar and dedicated people I’ve ever known.</p>
  <p>Think back to the start of 2022: Changes was slowly emerging from the pandemic and about to undergo a fundamental transformation from an in-person, Northwest-focused group to a fully online, unified organization serving members in 18 states. It was the immense amount of work performed by volunteers on our Communications, Outreach and Program committees, headed by Board members, that updated and revamped all our materials for use online.  We completely changed our look, our logo and our website. We’re stronger than ever and continue to thrive!</p>
  <p>What will Changes accomplish next year?  That’s largely up to you.  Please consider joining a committee or filling another volunteer role – we need your insights and talents.</p>
  <p>Stephanie Mannion, former Board president, has agreed to step back into the president’s role for 2025 and she will head a board with several terrific new members to be announced later.</p>
  <p>Eleanor Roosevelt liked to say, “A woman is like a tea bag. You never know how strong it is until it&#8217;s in hot water.”  Like most new Changes members, I was at full boil when I discovered this dynamic organization. Thanks to the skills and techniques I learned in Changes, I know I can stand up to the water no matter how hot it gets.</p>
  <p>Though I am leaving the Board, I will continue to repay my debt to Changes by serving on committees and hope you will join me.  Support your fellow tea bags and become a Changes volunteer!</p>

Karen Gustafson is stepping down as President of the Board of Directors after three transformative years at Changes, a nonprofit organization. Her leadership coincided with a significant shift from an in-person, Northwest-centric group to a fully online entity serving members across 18 states. This transition involved extensive volunteer efforts to revamp communications and materials for online use, resulting in a new logo and website. Gustafson emphasizes that the true strength of Changes lies with its members and their contributions, urging others to get involved in committees or volunteer roles. Stephanie Mannion will assume the presidency for 2025, supported by several new board members. Gustafson reflects on her journey with the organization, expressing gratitude for the skills and resilience gained through her experience. She plans to continue her involvement by serving on committees and encourages others to join her in supporting the community through volunteerism.
