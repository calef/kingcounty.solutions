Karen Gustafson is stepping down as President of the Board of Directors after three transformative years at Changes, a nonprofit organization. Her leadership coincided with a significant shift from an in-person, Northwest-centric group to a fully online entity serving members across 18 states. This transition involved extensive volunteer efforts to revamp communications and materials for online use, resulting in a new logo and website. Gustafson emphasizes that the true strength of Changes lies with its members and their contributions, urging others to get involved in committees or volunteer roles. Stephanie Mannion will assume the presidency for 2025, supported by several new board members. Gustafson reflects on her journey with the organization, expressing gratitude for the skills and resilience gained through her experience. She plans to continue her involvement by serving on committees and encourages others to join her in supporting the community through volunteerism.
