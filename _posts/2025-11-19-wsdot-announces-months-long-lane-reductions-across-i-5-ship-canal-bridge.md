WSDOT has announced that lane reductions will begin on the northbound lanes of Interstate 5 across the Ship Canal Bridge starting January 9, 2026, as part of the Revive I-5 Ship Canal Bridge Preservation project. The work, which is expected to last several months, involves 24/7 repairs and resurfacing of the bridge deck, as well as replacing aging expansion joints and improving drainage. A full weekend closure of northbound I-5 from I-90 to Northeast 45th Street is planned for January 9-12 to establish the work zone. Following this, two lanes will remain open for bridge work until a second full closure is scheduled for June 5-8, 2026, to remove the work zone. All lanes will be open during the FIFA World Cup games in Seattle, with further closures planned later in July to set up additional work. The project aims to extend the life of the bridge, which sees nearly 240,000 vehicles daily and has not undergone major maintenance in over 40 years. Traffic impacts are anticipated, and drivers are encouraged to adjust their travel plans accordingly.
