SpiritWalk & Warrior Run recently took place, featuring a 5K run and a 2K walk, with gratitude expressed to all participants. The event was made possible through the partnership with Brooks Running and sponsorship from Molina Healthcare, Community Health Plan of Washington, and the Washington State Office of Equity. Attendees were treated to a delicious lunch prepared by Chef Jeremy Thunderbird and his team. For those unable to attend, photos capturing the excitement of the participants are available for viewing.
