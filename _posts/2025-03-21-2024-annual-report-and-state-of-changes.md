2024 was a significant year for Changes, highlighted by accomplishments under outgoing Board President Karen Gustafson’s leadership. The organization successfully offset missed fundraising with investment and seminar income, updated its Mission and Vision statements, and reduced new member onboarding time to under one week. Changes expanded its national presence to 28 states, launched its first Facebook video ads, produced an animated video, and refreshed all member documentation. Two social events were held in the Seattle area, and the organization transitioned its Tuesday and Saturday meetings to healthier formats.

As 2025 begins, the board undergoes substantial changes, with Gustafson stepping down and Kathleen Coletta and Ellen Lewis also leaving their positions. Paul Jensen continues as Vice President, while Jenine Solack and Soph Davenberry join the board, among others. Ann Forrest will work on diversifying the member base. Stephanie Mannion serves as interim Board President, committed to expanding the organization’s reach. The financial summary and donor list for 2024 are included, acknowledging the generosity that sustains the non-profit's operations.
