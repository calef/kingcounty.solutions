The holiday season often brings increased physical demands and emotional stress. Ergonomics in the kitchen can help reduce physical strain from long periods of standing, lifting heavy dishes, and repetitive tasks. Experts recommend using a supportive floor mat, adjusting work surfaces to waist height, keeping frequently used items within easy reach, and alternating tasks. Extended travel can also take a toll on the body, with recommendations to take stretch breaks, use lumbar support, avoid twisting when lifting luggage, and try seated stretches. Emotional stress can affect physical health; regular physical activity, breathing techniques, setting realistic expectations, and staying connected can help manage stress.
