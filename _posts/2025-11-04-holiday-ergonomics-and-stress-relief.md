  As the holiday season approaches, many people find themselves spending more time in the kitchen, traveling, or preparing for family gatherings. While these moments bring joy, they can also bring increased physical demands and emotional stress.

  November is the perfect time to focus on injury prevention, body mechanics, and stress management strategies that support overall well-being.

  #### **Ergonomics in the Kitchen**

  Holiday cooking often involves long periods of standing, lifting heavy dishes, and repetitive tasks like chopping and stirring. Poor body mechanics in the kitchen can lead to neck, back, and shoulder pain—especially if you’re leaning forward or reaching overhead repeatedly.

  **Occupational therapists recommend the following ergonomic tips to reduce strain while cooking:**

  - Use a supportive floor mat if you are standing for extended periods.

  - Adjust your work surface to waist height whenever possible.

  - Keep frequently used items within easy reach to avoid excessive bending or reaching.

  - Alternate tasks to give specific muscle groups a break (for example, chop vegetables while seated, then return to stirring at the stove).

  If you experience discomfort after cooking or cleaning, a visit with a physical or occupational therapist can help identify and address biomechanical contributors to pain.

  #### **Travel and Posture**

  Whether driving to see relatives or flying across the country, holiday travel can take a toll on your body. Extended sitting and awkward luggage handling often lead to stiffness—especially in the lower back and shoulders.

  **To reduce the impact of travel on your body:**

  - Take breaks to stretch or walk every 1–2 hours.

  - Use lumbar support pillows or rolled-up towels to maintain spine alignment.

  - Avoid twisting motions when lifting luggage—bend at your knees and pivot with your feet.

  - Try seated stretches such as neck rolls, shoulder shrugs, and ankle circles during flights or long car rides.

  Physical therapists can demonstrate safe lifting techniques and prescribe targeted stretches to improve comfort during travel.

  #### **Speech and Stress**

  The holidays are often filled with conversations, presentations, and family events that can place unexpected strain on your voice. For individuals who already experience hoarseness, vocal fatigue, or underlying voice disorders, this time of year can be particularly challenging.

  **Speech-language pathologists recommend:**

  - Staying hydrated, especially in dry indoor environments.

  - Limiting yelling or speaking in loud environments for extended periods.

  - Warming up your voice before events by humming or practicing gentle pitch glides.

  - Scheduling rest periods for your voice after prolonged use.

  For individuals who use their voice professionally or experience recurring symptoms, speech therapy can help prevent long-term vocal damage and improve vocal endurance.

  #### **Managing Holiday Stress**

  Emotional stress is another factor that can affect physical health. Increased stress levels are associated with higher reports of chronic pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbances.

  Physical, occupational, and speech therapists can all play a role in helping patients identify triggers and adopt coping strategies.

  **Simple ways to support emotional health during the holidays include:**

  - Engaging in regular physical activity.

  - Practicing breathing techniques or guided relaxation.

  - Setting realistic expectations and boundaries with family and social events.

  - Staying connected with supportive peers or providers.

The holiday season often brings increased physical demands and emotional stress. Ergonomics in the kitchen can help reduce physical strain from long periods of standing, lifting heavy dishes, and repetitive tasks. Experts recommend using a supportive floor mat, adjusting work surfaces to waist height, keeping frequently used items within easy reach, and alternating tasks. Extended travel can also take a toll on the body, with recommendations to take stretch breaks, use lumbar support, avoid twisting when lifting luggage, and try seated stretches. Emotional stress can affect physical health; regular physical activity, breathing techniques, setting realistic expectations, and staying connected can help manage stress.
