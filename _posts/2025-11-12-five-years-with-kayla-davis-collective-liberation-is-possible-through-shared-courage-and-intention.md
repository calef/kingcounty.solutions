  Davis</a> joined Inatai Foundation five years ago as a Program Associate on the
  Grantmaking team. Through the years her deeply relational approach to leadership,
  sharp attention to detail, and an unwavering belief in our collective liberation
  propelled her into several roles, including Program Manager responsible for building
  out the foundation’s program management work. She now serves as a Senior Manager
  of Operations on the Operations &amp; Finance side of the organization. We asked
  Kayla five questions for her five-year anniversary with Inatai.</p>\n<p><strong>1.
  Where is your favorite place in Washington?</strong></p>\n<p>My favorite place in
  Washington state is The Tri-Cities. I love it for its warm summer weather, rich
  and vibrant culture, and amazing food that reflects the community&#8217;s diversity.
  The surrounding mountains and nearby water make it a truly beautiful place, perfect
  for both relaxation and adventure. Tri-Cities has a special energy that always makes
  me feel connected and inspired.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Which Inatai value resonates
  with you the most?</strong></p>\n<p>Collective liberation resonates deeply with
  me because it reflects the world I dream of, one where everyone has the opportunity
  to live freely, fully, and with dignity. It speaks to the world my ancestors deserved
  but were denied, and to the responsibility I carry to help build that reality for
  future generations.</p>\n<p>Collective liberation reminds me that liberation is
  not something we achieve alone; it’s something we create together. When one community
  is oppressed, none of us are truly free. But when we work collectively, sharing
  power, resources, and care, we begin to create conditions where everyone can thrive.</p>\n<p>Collective
  liberation calls me to move through my work and relationships with empathy, accountability,
  and courage. It challenges me to imagine beyond what it is and to contribute to
  what can be a world rooted in justice, abundance, and shared humanity.</p>\n<p><strong>3.
  What is an important lesson you learned over the last five years?</strong></p>\n<p>Over
  the past five years, I’ve learned that we are capable of anything when we come together.
  True power doesn’t rest in a single person or institution it lives within all of
  us. When we dare to dream collectively, co-conspire with courage, and take intentional
  action side by side, real change becomes possible.</p>\n<p>I’ve also learned that
  our voices and lived experiences matter deeply. Who we are, our stories, our identities,
  and our humanity are both powerful and beautiful. When we bring our full selves
  to the work of collective liberation, we remind the world that transformation starts
  with people who believe in one another.</p>\n<p><strong>4. What do you think makes
  Inatai different from other organizations you’ve been part of?</strong></p>\n<p>What
  makes Inatai special are the people, the culture, and our deep commitment to Washington
  state. It’s the way we dream boldly and invest in powerful organizations that are
  working towards a more racially just and equitable world.</p>\n<p>Inatai is special
  because of the intentional care we show not only for the communities we serve, but
  for one another. Every interaction, every collaboration, reflects a shared belief
  that change begins with relationships rooted in trust, compassion, and purpose.</p>\n<p>It’s
  a rare and beautiful thing to be a part of a place where people lead with heart,
  hold big visions, and work collectively to bring them to life. Inatai is truly a
  special place.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Finish this sentence: Racial justice and equity
  are important to me because …</strong> they are basic human rights. Every person
  deserves to live in a world where their humanity is honored, their voice is valued,
  and their opportunities are not limited by race or identity.</p>\n<p>To me, racial
  justice and equity mean creating systems and communities where everyone can thrive,
  not just survive. It’s about repairing harm and redistributing power, and ensuring
  that fairness and dignity are not privileges, but guarantees.</p>\n<p>This work
  matters because our collective freedom depends on it. When equity is realized, we
  all benefit; when justice prevails, we all move closer to the world we deserve.</p></div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>"

Kayla Davis, senior manager of operations at Inatai Foundation, reflects on her five-year journey with the organization, where she has held various roles since joining as a program associate. She highlights her favorite place in Washington as the Tri-Cities, appreciating its vibrant culture and natural beauty. 

Davis resonates deeply with the value of collective liberation, emphasizing the importance of shared power and community in achieving true freedom and justice. She has learned that collective action can lead to significant change and that individual stories and experiences are vital to this process. 

Davis believes Inatai stands out for its people, culture, and commitment to racial justice and equity, fostering relationships rooted in trust and compassion. For her, racial justice and equity are fundamental human rights, essential for creating a world where everyone's humanity is honored and opportunities are equitable. 

She advocates for a collective approach to liberation, asserting that when one community suffers, none are free, and that working together is crucial for building a just and inclusive future.
