Bellevue's Community Programming Fund (CPF) has successfully supported nearly 40 events this year, including a book giveaway at Downtown Park and a night market in BelRed. The CPF aims to foster community engagement in public spaces along the Grand Connection corridor, offering grants of up to $15,000. The program is expected to return next year with a focus on series-based activities and World Cup themes. 

Additional highlights from this quarter's It's Your City newsletter include guidance on e-bikes and e-scooters, emphasizing responsible use in the growing micromobility landscape. The Civic Innovation Challenge has selected partners Certivo, Legislaide, Juganu, and FindIt to develop AI solutions for municipal challenges. The City Council is also seeking input on 37 proposed locations for new speed safety cameras, intended to curb high-end speeding linked to serious accidents. 

In the Council Corner column, Deputy Mayor Mo Malakoutian shares tips for enhancing mental and physical health, promoting Bellevue’s parks, trails, farmers markets, and community centers as vital resources. It's Your City is distributed three times a year to all residential and business addresses in Bellevue, with the next issue scheduled for early spring.
