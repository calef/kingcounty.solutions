Lowe’s Home Centers LLC has agreed to pay a $12.5 million penalty to settle allegations of violating the EPA’s Lead Renovation, Repair and Painting (RRP) rule. These violations occurred during renovation work conducted by Lowe’s contractors at numerous homes across the U.S. from 2019 to 2021. The settlement mandates that Lowe’s enhance its compliance program to ensure that all renovation work in homes potentially containing lead-based paint is performed by certified contractors trained in lead-safe practices.

The Justice Department and the EPA emphasized the dangers of improper lead paint handling, particularly for children and vulnerable populations. Following a 2014 consent decree, Lowe’s failed to meet compliance requirements, prompting further investigation after public tips regarding its contractors' work in California. The use of residential lead-based paint was banned in 1978, but it still poses health risks in older homes. Lead exposure can result in serious health issues, including developmental disorders in children. The consent decree is lodged in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California and is open for public comment before final approval.
