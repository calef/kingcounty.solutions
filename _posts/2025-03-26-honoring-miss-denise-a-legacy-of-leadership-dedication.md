  <p>As we celebrate Women’s History Month, we recognize the incredible women who have shaped the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of King County; few people have more history than Denise Overton-Lewis. With 40 years of service to the Clubs leads with passion, touching the lives of countless youth, families, and staff members.</p>
  <p>When she first walked into a Boys &amp; Girls Club, Denise knew she had found her second home. <em>“The staff, Club members, and volunteers felt like one big family,”</em> she reflects. <em>“I bleed Boys &amp; Girls Club through and through. The mission, the values of leadership, character building, compassion, and inclusiveness—I wouldn’t change this journey for the world.”</em></p>
  <p>From her early days as a volunteer to becoming a staff member, Denise has impacted generations. <em>“Denise’s passion is infectious, and her commitment has been a cornerstone of the Club community,”</em> shares Kendrick Davis, Area Director. <em>“She’s been a rock for countless kids, teens, and staff over the years—always showing up, always leading with her heart. And let me tell you, she can put her foot in some greens! You can taste and see the love and care she pours into everything.”</em></p>
  <p>Denise’s leadership extends beyond youth, empowering staff by creating a culture of care and connection. Are’onna Williams, Education Director at Smilow Rainier Vista Club, says, <em>“Denise is very caring. She is always</em><em> checking in with her staff to ensure we&#8217;re doing okay and is dedicated to her work at Vista. I appreciate Denise so much for working hard and being the strong woman she has always been. She&#8217;s very understanding and reliable and will always be there when you need her—and ouuu, those greens will be the one!!! I appreciate her so much for being the solid, independent woman she is.”</em></p>
  <p>Her leadership has included empowering women within the organization by being authentic and creating opportunities for others to lead. &#8220;<em>Mentorship, giving staff a voice, celebrating wins—big and small—and leading consistently have been my guiding principles,”</em> Denise shares.</p>
  <p><em>“Ms. Denise has a strength that is both powerful and gentle. She is the kind of woman who always shows up—whether you see her every day or not, you know she’s there. Her love for people isn’t flashy; it’s felt in her quiet, unwavering ways of supporting those around her. The way people are drawn to her speaks volumes about the love she gives. Step into her office, and you’ll see it—a space filled with memories, pride, and the deep connections she’s built. She is truly cherished,” </em>shared Paige Ronsen, Volunteer &amp; In-Kind Gifts Coordinator,</p>
  <p>As she looks toward retirement, Denise’s impact will continue. She stated that her love for the Clubs runs deep, and she plans to spend her free time right where she started—giving back to youth and mentoring the next generation of leaders. Denise’s legacy is one of resilience, mentorship, and unwavering dedication.</p>
