Kim Donovan has lived with multiple sclerosis (MS) for over thirty years, facing daily challenges compounded by caring for her father with Alzheimer's and supporting a family member with addiction. Seeking stability, she moved into Bellwether’s Graham Terry building in Seattle, initially filled with uncertainty about affordable housing but soon found hope in her new environment. Bellwether provided not just housing but community support, moving her to an ADA-accessible unit as her health needs changed. Kim thrived, establishing routines, building connections with neighbors, and advocating for others with MS. She co-founded a nonprofit, MS-EAS, which has provided over $250,000 in emergency assistance to individuals with MS. Kim now gives back to Bellwether Housing as a monthly donor, recognizing the significant impact of affordable housing on her life. She emphasizes the importance of community support and expresses a desire to help others achieve the same opportunities she received. Kim’s journey highlights the transformative power of stable, affordable housing and the importance of community in fostering resilience and advocacy.
