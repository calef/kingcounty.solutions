  It may seem logical that patient outcomes after lung resection surgery are significantly better in larger hospitals that perform many of these surgeries rather than in smaller hospitals that perform the surgery much less often, but St. Louis VA researchers found VA facilities consistently have fewer major complications, incidents of recurrence and better odds of overall survival regardless of the facility’s size.

VA research is advancing in various critical health areas, focusing on lung cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, and maternity care. A recent study highlights the effectiveness of a new lung cancer screening protocol that utilizes low-dose CT scans, significantly improving early detection rates among veterans. This approach aims to reduce lung cancer mortality through timely intervention.

In Alzheimer’s research, the VA is exploring the connection between traumatic brain injury (TBI) and an increased risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. Findings suggest that veterans who have experienced TBI may face heightened vulnerability to cognitive decline, prompting further investigation into preventive strategies and treatments.

Additionally, the VA is enhancing maternity care for veterans by implementing comprehensive programs to support expectant mothers. These initiatives include improved access to prenatal care, mental health support, and resources tailored to the unique needs of veterans, ensuring a healthier pregnancy experience.

Overall, VA research is committed to improving health outcomes for veterans by addressing significant challenges in oncology, neurology, and reproductive health, ultimately leading to better quality of life and healthcare services.
