Medical device company Aesculap Implant Systems LLC has agreed to pay $38.5 million to settle allegations under the False Claims Act regarding the sale of knee replacement devices that were known to fail prematurely, leading to false claims to Medicare and Medicaid. The settlement also addresses claims that Aesculap made unlawful payments to a physician to promote the use of these implants. Furthermore, Aesculap entered a non-prosecution agreement related to the distribution of two medical devices that lacked necessary FDA clearance. 

The allegations state that from July 2010 to June 2023, Aesculap sold the VEGA System® Knee System, despite being aware that it was prone to early failure and could cause significant patient complications. The company reportedly failed to disclose these risks to healthcare providers and regulators. Additionally, Aesculap was accused of not adequately tracking or reporting adverse events related to the device. The settlement includes compensation for whistleblowers who reported the violations, totaling $4,475,000. This case highlights the government’s commitment to combating healthcare fraud and ensuring the safety of medical devices.
