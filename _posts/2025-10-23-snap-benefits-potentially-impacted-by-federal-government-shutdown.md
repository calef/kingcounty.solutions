The Snoqualmie Tribe announced that in the event of a potential impact on SNAP benefits due to an ongoing federal shutdown, they will open the Tribe's Emergency Food Assistance Program to eligible Tribal Members on SNAP. This move is to ensure food support remains in place. The Tribal Council has approved this decision. Additional details about this process will be provided later if needed.
