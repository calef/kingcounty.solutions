DESC is preparing to welcome 109 clients to Steven’s Place and seeks community assistance to make their transition into permanent homes comfortable. Donations of bedding, kitchen, and bathroom supplies are essential for transforming empty apartments into welcoming environments. Individuals can help in two ways: by adopting an apartment, which involves both donating and setting up the space on November 8th, or by sponsoring an apartment, allowing the organization to purchase supplies that volunteers will set up. The adoption event, scheduled from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., will be family-friendly, featuring activities like creating welcome signs. Additionally, community members can contribute by sending in a “Welcome Home” sign, which can be colored and submitted in person or via mail. This initiative not only supports the new residents but also fosters community engagement and solidarity.
