The key dates for these high tides are November 7-8, December 2-9, December 24-29, January 2-8, January 21-24, and February 1-5. Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) is prepared for this seasonal weather by monitoring storms, tides, and atmospheric pressure to manage potential flooding events.

For emergencies, individuals should call 911, while urgent flooding or sewer backup issues can be reported to SPU’s 24/7 Operations Response Center at (206) 386-1800. Those in the South Park neighborhood can register for text notifications regarding local flood information.
