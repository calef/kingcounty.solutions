Approximately 200 individuals gathered at Seattle City Hall on October 28 to honor Domestic Violence Awareness Month during the “Giving Flowers” event. Hosted by the Human Services Department’s Mayor’s Office on Sexual Assault and Domestic Violence and the Seattle Women’s Commission, the event aimed to cultivate healing and celebrate resilience among survivors of gender-based violence and their advocates. Attendees received long-stemmed roses symbolizing their support for survivors, while artwork highlighted the healing journey. A collective timeline was created, marking significant initiatives addressing gender-based violence.

Keynote speaker Taffy Maene-Johnson of UTOPIA Washington emphasized the importance of solidarity for LGBTQIA+ survivors, affirming that they are not alone and deserve recognition for their strength. The event also featured readings of survival stories from partner organizations, showcasing the progress and empowerment of survivors. The Human Services Department invests over $15 million annually in initiatives to combat gender-based violence, serving more than 10,000 survivors each year. The observance of Domestic Violence Awareness Month dates back to 1981, becoming federally recognized in 1989. The event served as a powerful reminder of community support and hope for those affected by domestic violence.
