A Colorado man, Steven Glenn Christiansen, 69, has been sentenced to 10 years in prison followed by lifetime supervised release for his involvement in an online forum dedicated to the sexual exploitation of minors. Christiansen utilized a mobile messaging app to participate in "invite only" group chats where users exchanged images and videos of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). He directly communicated with other users to request and share CSAM. During a search of his residence, law enforcement seized multiple digital devices containing thousands of images and videos of CSAM, which Christiansen admitted to possessing. He pleaded guilty in August 2025 to one count of possession of child pornography and has a prior conviction from March 2000 for sexually assaulting a child. The case was prosecuted by the Justice Department’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section and the District of Colorado. This prosecution is part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative aimed at combating child sexual exploitation and abuse, which was launched in May 2006.
