Walmart is partnering with Operation Homefront for the third consecutive year through its Spark Good program to support military families. From November 3 to November 30, customers can round up their purchases at checkout on Walmart.com and the Walmart app to contribute to Operation Homefront’s mission of creating strong, stable military and veteran families. Walmart will match these customer donations at a rate of 2:1, up to $2 million. This initiative reflects Walmart's commitment to honoring veterans, a principle rooted in the company's history dating back to founder Sam Walton, a World War II veteran. The Walmart Foundation focuses on improving employment, education, and well-being for military families. To date, the Spark Good Round Up program has raised over $5 million for Operation Homefront, which provides critical services to prevent short-term needs from becoming long-term struggles for military families. Operation Homefront emphasizes its gratitude for Walmart's ongoing support, highlighting the significant impact this partnership has on families who have served the nation.
