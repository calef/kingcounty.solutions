The City of Medina is updating its Critical Areas Ordinance (CAO) to enhance the protection of critical areas such as streams, wetlands, and geologically hazardous areas. This update is mandated by Washington State Law and aims to align with the Medina Comprehensive Plan and the Growth Management Act. The last update occurred in 2016, with the new adoption expected in January 2026. The process will incorporate current scientific data to ensure effective conservation strategies and allow for public feedback throughout the development timeline.
