Standard Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) and Radically Open Dialectical Behavior Therapy (RO-DBT) differ primarily in their target populations and therapeutic focuses. Standard DBT, developed by Dr. Marsha Linehan, is intended for individuals with emotional dysregulation, such as those with borderline personality disorder, and aims to help clients regulate intense emotions and improve interpersonal relationships. In contrast, RO-DBT, created by Dr. Thomas Lynch, targets individuals with overcontrol traits, who often exhibit perfectionism and emotional suppression. RO-DBT encourages emotional expression, flexibility, and social engagement, focusing on overcoming rigidity and fostering vulnerability.

Both therapies balance acceptance and change but employ different methods. Standard DBT emphasizes mindfulness and distress tolerance, while RO-DBT addresses emotional avoidance and social disconnection, placing importance on social signaling. Skills training in Standard DBT includes modules on mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness, whereas RO-DBT emphasizes openness to experience and social flexibility.

Overall, Standard DBT is beneficial for those struggling with emotional intensity, while RO-DBT is suited for individuals who may sabotage relationships due to perfectionistic tendencies. Both therapies adapt DBT principles to their specific emotional experiences and goals.
