  The main differences between&nbsp;**Standard Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**Radically Open Dialectical Behavior Therapy (RO-DBT)**&nbsp;are in the target populations the therapies are meant to treat and focuses of the therapies themselves.

  **1.&nbsp;Target Populations:**

  - **Standard DBT** : Originally developed by Dr. Marsha Linehan to treat individuals with suicidal ideation, self-harming behaviors, and&nbsp;**borderline personality disorder (BPD)**, DBT has been adapted for other conditions, such as anxiety disorders, depression, and substance use. Standard DBT is most helpful for people who experience&nbsp; **emotional dysregulation** , intense mood swings, and a pattern of unstable relationships.

  - **RO-DBT** : RO-DBT is a newer, modified form of DBT, developed by Dr. Thomas Lynch, designed to treat individuals with&nbsp; **overcontrol.** &nbsp;Though individuals with overcontrol may experience suicidal ideation, self-harming urges, and “emotional leakage”, most of their emotional expression is self-contained. People with overcontrol tend to be self-disciplined, perfectionistic, and emotionally restrained. They may struggle with&nbsp; **rigidity, social isolation** , and&nbsp; **difficulty expressing emotions**. RO-DBT is often used for conditions such as anxiety, avoidance, depression,&nbsp;**obsessive-compulsive personality disorder (OCPD)**,&nbsp; **anorexia nervosa** , and&nbsp; **chronic depression**. It is also often indicated for ASD.

  **2.&nbsp;Core Focus:**

  - **Standard DBT** : Focuses on helping individuals with&nbsp; **emotional dysregulation** , impulsivity, and behaviors such as self-harm, suicidal ideation, or unhealthy coping strategies.

The main aim is to help clients become more emotionally expressive, let go of rigid perfectionism, and engage in more adaptive behaviors. RO-DBT helps clients to experience&nbsp; **vulnerability** &nbsp;and increase&nbsp; **social engagement** &nbsp;rather than suppressing emotions and avoiding risk.

  **3.&nbsp;Therapeutic Approach:**

  - **Standard DBT** : Involves a balance of&nbsp; **acceptance and change** , emphasizing mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness. It teaches skills for managing intense emotions, making decisions in the moment, and developing healthy relationships.

  - **RO-DBT** : Also involves&nbsp; **acceptance and change,** &nbsp;but focuses on addressing issues such as&nbsp; **rigid thinking** , emotional avoidance, and social disconnection. It encourages clients to&nbsp; **open up** &nbsp;emotionally,&nbsp; **take risks** &nbsp;in social interactions, and challenge their need for perfectionism and control.

Standard Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) and Radically Open Dialectical Behavior Therapy (RO-DBT) differ primarily in their target populations and therapeutic focuses. Standard DBT, developed by Dr. Marsha Linehan, is intended for individuals with emotional dysregulation, such as those with borderline personality disorder, and aims to help clients regulate intense emotions and improve interpersonal relationships. In contrast, RO-DBT, created by Dr. Thomas Lynch, targets individuals with overcontrol traits, who often exhibit perfectionism and emotional suppression. RO-DBT encourages emotional expression, flexibility, and social engagement, focusing on overcoming rigidity and fostering vulnerability.

Both therapies balance acceptance and change but employ different methods. Standard DBT emphasizes mindfulness and distress tolerance, while RO-DBT addresses emotional avoidance and social disconnection, placing importance on social signaling. Skills training in Standard DBT includes modules on mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness, whereas RO-DBT emphasizes openness to experience and social flexibility.

Overall, Standard DBT is beneficial for those struggling with emotional intensity, while RO-DBT is suited for individuals who may sabotage relationships due to perfectionistic tendencies. Both therapies adapt DBT principles to their specific emotional experiences and goals.
