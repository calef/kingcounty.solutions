A federal grand jury in Florida indicted Marek Rex Vernon Harrison, a 61-year-old U.K. citizen residing in Plant City, for his involvement in a telehealth fraud scheme that defrauded Medicare of over $2.7 million. Harrison allegedly ran CTD Network LLC, a telemedicine company that employed medical providers to authorize unnecessary prescriptions for genetic tests without any prior relationship with the beneficiaries. These providers conducted telehealth consultations and generated fraudulent claims, resulting in Medicare payments exceeding $600,000 for services that were either unnecessary or not provided.

The indictment also accuses Harrison of submitting false Medicare enrollment documents to obscure his ownership and management role in CTD, including concealing a prior bank fraud conviction. The case is being prosecuted by the Department of Justice's Fraud Section, with investigations led by the FBI and the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General. The Health Care Fraud Strike Force Program, which has charged thousands of defendants since its inception, is involved in combating such health care fraud schemes. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty in court.
