An Idaho executive, Michael Smith, pleaded guilty to insider trading involving material nonpublic information regarding the impending acquisition of Company-1, where he served as President and Chief Operating Officer. Smith, 48, had access to sensitive information due to his position and was prohibited from trading Company-1 stock under its Insider Trading Policy. On July 26, 2024, he purchased Company-1 shares using a brokerage account belonging to a close associate, Individual-A, based on this insider information. Following the public announcement of the acquisition on August 7, 2024, Company-1's stock price surged nearly 50%. The next day, Smith sold the shares for a profit of approximately $145,754.69, intended to benefit Individual-A. Smith faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison for securities fraud, with sentencing to be determined by a federal district court judge. The investigation is being conducted by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service Criminal Investigations Group, and the case is being prosecuted by attorneys from the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and the District of Idaho.
