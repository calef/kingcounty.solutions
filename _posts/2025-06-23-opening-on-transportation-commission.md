The City Council of Bellevue invites residents to apply for a vacancy on the Transportation Commission, which provides guidance on transportation planning, projects, traffic standards, and funding strategies. Applications are open until July 11. The commission is essential for shaping Bellevue’s multimodal transportation system and ensuring that policies align with community needs. Commissioners meet monthly on the second Thursday at 6:30 p.m., with additional meetings as required on the fourth Thursday. Applicants must be Bellevue residents and will be appointed by the mayor with council approval, serving four-year terms on a volunteer basis. The city encourages applications from residents of diverse backgrounds. For those who prefer a paper application, they can be obtained from the City Clerk’s Office, City Hall, or local libraries. Applications can be submitted online or through various methods, including hand delivery or email. For further details regarding the commission's responsibilities, residents can contact senior transportation planner Kevin McDonald at 425-452-4558.
