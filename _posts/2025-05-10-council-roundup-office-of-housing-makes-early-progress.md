  County sewer rate proposal and 20-year forecast</h4><p>The City Council received
  an update from the King County Wastewater Treatment Division on proposed 2026 sewer
  rate and capacity charges, and a 20-year forecast that includes rate increases.
  The forecast would increase wholesale sewer treatment rates over the next 20 years
  from $58.28 per month per average residential customer in 2025 to $139.42 in 2035
  and $173.57 in 2045, equating to a 140 percent increase over the next 10 years and

  Council expressed concern about the impact significant rate increases will have

  a letter to the King County Council communicating the City of Bellevue position
  concerning the proposed 2026 sewer rate, sharing the council’s thoughts on the long-term
  rate path and the importance of completing the Regional Wastewater Services Plan
  update. The letter will include recommendations on guiding principles for King County
  to work towards reasonable planning, clear rate transparency, and continued refinement

At a recent City Council meeting, an update was provided on the newly established Office of Housing, launched in February to enhance affordable housing initiatives in Bellevue. This office is working on the Affordable Housing Strategy update, the homelessness outreach program, and the Multi-Family Tax Exemption (MFTE) program. It has already solicited residential development proposals for city-owned sites in Wilburton and BelRed, aiming to create up to 400 affordable housing units.

Additionally, the council received a report from the King County Wastewater Treatment Division regarding proposed sewer rate increases over the next 20 years, projecting a 140% increase by 2035. Concerns were raised about the affordability impact on residents, prompting the council to draft a letter to the King County Council addressing these issues and advocating for clearer rate transparency and equitable planning.

New council member Vishal Bhargava was sworn in, taking the seat vacated by John Stokes until the November election. The council also underwent open government training, as mandated by state law, and recognized May as Jewish American Heritage Month, along with other proclamations for the month.
