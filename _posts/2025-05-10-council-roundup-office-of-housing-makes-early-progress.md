At a recent City Council meeting, an update was provided on the newly established Office of Housing, launched in February to enhance affordable housing initiatives in Bellevue. This office is working on the Affordable Housing Strategy update, the homelessness outreach program, and the Multi-Family Tax Exemption (MFTE) program. It has already solicited residential development proposals for city-owned sites in Wilburton and BelRed, aiming to create up to 400 affordable housing units.

Additionally, the council received a report from the King County Wastewater Treatment Division regarding proposed sewer rate increases over the next 20 years, projecting a 140% increase by 2035. Concerns were raised about the affordability impact on residents, prompting the council to draft a letter to the King County Council addressing these issues and advocating for clearer rate transparency and equitable planning.

New councilmember Vishal Bhargava was sworn in, taking the seat vacated by John Stokes until the November election. The council also underwent open government training, as mandated by state law, and recognized May as Jewish American Heritage Month along with other proclamations for the month.
