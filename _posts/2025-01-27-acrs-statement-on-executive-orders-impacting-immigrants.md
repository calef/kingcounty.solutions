The Asian Counseling and Referral Service (ACRS) has issued a statement expressing its commitment to immigrants and refugees, particularly in light of recent executive orders that threaten their well-being. ACRS highlights that these orders create fear and anxiety, jeopardizing individuals' ability to remain in the country and access essential health and social services. The organization encourages the community to stay informed, vigilant, and to prioritize safety during this challenging time. ACRS calls for solidarity with those affected, emphasizing that dignity and respect should be afforded to all, regardless of immigration status or criminal history. They stress the importance of collective action to address community needs and counter divisive rhetoric. Reflecting on past challenges, particularly those faced in 2017, ACRS urges unity and resilience in the face of adversity, advocating for a future rooted in compassion and justice.
