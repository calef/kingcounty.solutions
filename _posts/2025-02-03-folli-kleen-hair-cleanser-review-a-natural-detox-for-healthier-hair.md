title: 'Folli-Kleen Hair Cleanser Review: A Natural Detox for Healthier Hair'
topics: []
---

Folli-Kleen Hair Cleanser offers a deep cleaning solution for those concerned about toxins in their hair. This all-natural product targets impurities caused by pollution and hair products, utilizing a proprietary blend of ingredients like herbal extracts, aloe vera, tea tree oil, citrus extracts, ginseng, and vitamin B complex. These elements work together to detoxify the hair, improve scalp health, and promote hair growth, while also being easy to use—requiring only a single treatment for noticeable results.

Users have praised Folli-Kleen for its effective detoxification and refreshing properties, often noting improved scalp health and a rejuvenated feel to their hair. However, feedback mentions a strong scent and a 20-minute wait time as potential drawbacks. Additionally, those with very dry or curly hair might find it less moisturizing. Priced at $29.95, some customers consider it high for regular use.

Folli-Kleen is made in an FDA-registered facility in the USA, ensuring quality and safety. It is designed as an occasional detox treatment rather than a daily cleanser, making it a suitable addition for maintaining hair health and cleanliness.
