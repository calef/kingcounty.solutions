The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) provides various options for taxpayers seeking assistance with tax-related inquiries. Help is available online, by phone, or in-person. Online resources cover topics such as filing tax returns, checking refund status, identity theft, and payments. For those needing language support, assistance is offered in over 350 languages, with specific numbers for Spanish and other languages.

Taxpayers can contact the IRS by phone during business hours, with dedicated lines for individuals and businesses. If an inquiry concerns a mailed return, the IRS advises against calling or filing a second return until a response is received.

For in-person assistance, local IRS Taxpayer Assistance Centers (TAC) are available, and appointments can be scheduled by phone. The IRS also offers free tax preparation services through IRS Direct File and Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) sites, which are IRS certified. VITA provides free tax prep for qualifying individuals and has several locations for the 2025 tax season.
