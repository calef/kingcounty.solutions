  &nbsp;

  _The sound of the Zoom doorbell quietly chimed as more people were admitted into the call, exciting us even more for the interview. Among them was Cole Swanson, creator of NAMI Eastside’s blog program, writer, and storyteller. The sounds of the professor chatting with Cole, their voices a lulling sound in the background as our team prepared for the interview. A man with a neatly trimmed beard and short hair, styled similarly to a comb-over, appeared on screen. His hazel eyes were surrounded by rounded, brown-rimmed glasses that glinted in the sunlight that streamed down the left side of his face. He wore a loosely fitted blue t-shirt as he sat comfortably in his black office chair, leaning back and displaying a relaxed yet self-poised demeanor._

  &nbsp;

  _The room, bathed in ample light, was adorned with eclectic pieces that spoke to his artistic sensibilities and served as a canvas for Cole’s passions and interests. From thrifted paintings depicting scenes of serenity and cultural richness, to a cherished Vincent van Gogh masterpiece; each item seemed to hold a story. A well-worn, brown, L-shaped couch invitingly beckoned._ _Shifting the chair every so often ,with a slight turn left or back, gave us a view of his surroundings, which were filled to the brim with items that reflected this was a space well-used and loved.&nbsp;_

  &nbsp;

  _Cole, a young man who has traversed a few years since his college days, has embarked on his postgraduate journey with a profound desire to make a difference. Motivated by his passion for writing and a deep-seated longing to support youth who are grappling with their own mental health challenges, he found himself volunteering with_ [_NAMI Eastside_](https://nami-eastside.org/education/)_. His desire to provide the support to others he wished he had received during his own formative years, steered him towards the organization, and was propelled by a yearning to share his personal mental health journey._

  _&nbsp;_

  _Despite encountering minimal guidance from traditional educational channels, Cole’s journey took a transformative turn when his eighth-grade math teacher offered invaluable insights, which helped him to learn about_ [_ADHD_](https://www.nami.org/About-Mental-Illness/Mental-Health-Conditions/ADHD/) _– though it was not something he would recognize until years later._ _Cole spoke about how before he took ADHD medication his mind felt cluttered, like being in a room with desks and chairs. But after going to therapy and receiving medication, he felt everything became easier and clearer, like all the desks and chairs had been removed from his path._ _However, it wasn’t until he delved into the realm of volunteering, interacting with young minds, and engaging in educational presentations, that he truly began to understand the intricacies of his own experiences. By embracing vulnerability and dismantling the barriers that had hindered him from opening up, through the_ [_Ending the Silence_](https://ets.nami.org/) _Program he not only embarked on a journey of self-discovery but also became a beacon for others seeking solace and understanding._

  &nbsp;

  _Cole’s dedication to mental health advocacy shone brightly through his words and actions. His decision to volunteer with_ [_NAMI Eastside_](https://nami-eastside.org/education/) _immediately following college underscored his fervent belief in amplifying the voices of young individuals, particularly in matters pertaining to mental health for kids. Despite his own late diagnosis of ADHD, his commitment to supporting vulnerable children remained unwavering, driven by a profound empathy born from his own experiences._

  **What is your fascination with writing?**

  &nbsp;

  **CS:** I don’t know. I’ve always liked it, I don’t know when I started liking it, but I know I’ve always liked to tell stories; though I never could finish one. I’d always get a new idea and then I would move on to the next thing. I was never good at finishing anything until I grew up a little more, till my 20s probably. Yeah, now I just love how stories are written, I love the way people can tell a story, make something boring sound exciting, how they write it, the words they use, I just love everything about it. It’s just fun for me.&nbsp;

  &nbsp;

  **What is it like finding people to interview with their own personal stories?&nbsp;**

  &nbsp;

  **CS:** I think I’ve written [11 articles or blog posts](https://nami-eastside.org/living-with-suicidal-ideations/), and I think I interviewed maybe five people. They were all my friends or they were related to me in some way. So, I was comfortable asking them if they wanted to share their story, and it was nice to be able to get to know them more and help them open up. I enjoyed helping people share their voices, I guess.

  &nbsp;

  **What do you enjoy the most about your position?&nbsp;**

  &nbsp;

  **CS:** When I was with them [NAMI Eastside]. I liked that I could create. I was able to open a dialogue in multiple ways. So, you know, I did the [Ending the Silence] presentation, but then I also started the blog for them. And because I love writing and I love stories, and I wanted to share my own mental health, I was like, I need a way to do this. Especially during COVID on a permanent, bigger platform […]. I was able to do that and give other people voices as well as my own voice, influencing other people to do the same thing. I created a library of stories, I guess. And then, when I was doing social media work for them it felt nice to do it for a cause that I cared about.

  &nbsp;

  **With your work for volunteering with the kids, why did you want to help the kids, specifically, volunteer with them?**

  &nbsp;

  **CS:** When I grew up, I didn’t know I had any diagnosed mental health condition until after I graduated college. After college I wanted to get help, I knew something was wrong, but I didn’t know what was wrong. I wanted to fix what I thought was broken or was broken from the get. And I… wanted kids to feel that they can ask for help and be heard when they grow up too, before it gets too late I guess.

  &nbsp;

  When I was in high school and middle school, counselors just got [me] into college, they didn’t do anything else, they were advisors to get [me] to the next step and didn’t actually help [me] with anything. The counselors were relatively useless, at least based on my experience. Perhaps others have had positive experiences with counselors, but in my school, it felt like empty words. I didn’t do well in high school because I had trouble with mental health, […]. So, yeah, I wanted kids to make sure they could help themselves or reach out for help so they could advance on their own, or just kinda learn to understand themselves.

  &nbsp;

  **What is the importance of peer support in your recovery and health journey?**

  &nbsp;

  **CS:** I didn’t know I had a [major depressive disorder](https://www.nami.org/About-Mental-Illness/Mental-Health-Conditions/Depression/Major-Depressive-Disorder-with-a-Seasonal-Pattern/)until last year. But I’ve obviously had it for my whole life, I would assume anyway. And when you get to a certain point when you have that and you don’t know how to talk about it, you don’t know what words you use, or even how to share feelings or emote properly, you feel alone. You’re kinda always gonna feel alone; at least for me, generally speaking, but it’s nice to have peer support because you’re alone together, I guess. So, I can at least know people are there for me, and… again, I open up with them, they open up with me, and I feel a sense of community in the sense of like, if I ever need help, I can go to them. So even though I feel alone, it’s nice. It makes me less lonely.

  &nbsp;

  **Would you say there were any specific relationships that were important to you that helped you want to do this and support you through this?**

  &nbsp;

  **CS:** When I went to school I was not a good student in high school or college or middle school or any time. But it’s because I had undiagnosed [ADHD](https://www.nami.org/About-Mental-Illness/Mental-Health-Conditions/ADHD/) and all of my things. Once I got my pills after college for ADHD after turning to therapy, I realized that I had needed help beforehand. That’s why it’s important to understand yourself. I learned to understand myself and I looked back on a specific teacher in middle school.&nbsp;

  &nbsp;

  My math teacher, Ms. Saylor – I forgot her first name – but I’ll always remember her because she taught me how I learned. But what [she helped me to understand] is to compartmentalize everything, in order to take one piece at a time. Essentially, she would tutor me after class some days a week, or at the end of the day, on math homework, ‘cause I was struggling hard. She somehow figured out that it’s important for me to compartmentalize. What she did is, for every test, she would cut up the test [into question sections], and I’d fill out one question and bring it to her for the next [question]… she did that with every test, and my [test] grades went from D-to-A pretty fast. That was the only teacher, counselor, or professional that I ever had, who took the time to figure out how I work, especially when I didn’t know how to work. That always stuck with me. And I think that’s a big underlying driver for why working with kids is so important for me. I think without her I would still be confused and wouldn’t understand myself as well.

  &nbsp;

  **We have one [question] from [another student] who asks about the men who struggle in silence because of the stigma that men are weak. The perceived stigma that men are weak for admitting mental health issues. What would you say to them?**

  **CS:** I mean, you’re human, you have emotions, you know? It doesn’t make sense to hide any of it. It’s weird like you don’t have to share, you know? You don’t have to share your emotions with people if you don’t want to, but admitting them is important because then you can understand yourself. So, it’s not like anyone’s telling any man to be open. [I’m] just saying that it’s important to understand yourself by understanding your emotions. At least that’s how I interpret it. I just think it’s important to know yourself so you can take care of yourself. Yeah, you’re human, it’s as simple as that.

  &nbsp;

  **When speaking to students or big crowds, would you say there was any specific group that had gone to you afterward to try to speak to you more often than others?**

  &nbsp;

  **CS:** Definitely. The [younger students] would come up to me and thank me. Someone thanked me specifically because they have mental health conditions that they’re dealing with. So they like[d] my vulnerability. I got a lot of thank you from people who were vocal about their own struggles.

  &nbsp;

  **In your opinion, what role can students play in advocating for mental health awareness and support on college campuses?**

  &nbsp;

  **CS:** I guess it starts with advocating for yourself. It always starts with that. But then I think groups are helpful [also], like [support groups](https://namiseattle.org/support-resources/support-groups/). If you want to do that with kids and with your peers as well I think that can open up our community. Those are the two ways I know of.

  &nbsp;

  **What type of legacy would you like to leave behind?**

  &nbsp;

  **CS:** That’s a cool question. I’d say I want to be someone who made you feel better, like made you feel better about yourself just by being there. Specifically, when at past jobs, I’d have so much motivation to do well, but my coworkers lacked motivation because they had been jaded, and lost motivation. But me being there helped them, and re-energized them. I really enjoyed that. I like making people laugh and smile. If you feel better about yourself after, I’ve been there.&nbsp;

  &nbsp;

  _As the interview concluded, we believe that Cole’s contributions to NAMI Eastside were a great way to understand himself and help others. Cole left an astounding impression about the journey it takes to help oneself. From his earlier years to college and beyond, he has developed his story, shared it with others, and advocated that people have someone they can look to, whether it be someone with whom they can share their own struggles, or who understands that others go through the same thing, and knows you are not alone. We think that everyone has the choice to contribute to advocating for mental health, and he was a perfect example of how to make that happen. His story serves as a timeless reminder that regardless of life’s circumstances, each of us holds the power to enact meaningful change._

  &nbsp;

  _Here are some of the pieces Cole wrote and published for NAMI Eastside:&nbsp;_

  [_Living with Suicidal Ideations_](https://nami-eastside.org/living-with-suicidal-ideations/)

  [_Being Alone with Anxiety&nbsp;_](https://nami-eastside.org/being-alone-with-anxiety/)

  [_Men & Mental Health How to have an effective conversation_](https://nami-eastside.org/effective-conversation/)

  &nbsp;

  **_How others can volunteer for NAMI:&nbsp;_**

  _You, yourself, can go onto NAMI Eastside just like Cole, and get started on filling in your information for the_ [_volunteer work_](https://form.asana.com/?k=-Dn6a1bPyYSFT34McIKbiA&d=252412735618005)_. If you take this path, you can take a_ [_mental health first aid course_](https://namiskc.org/about-mental-illness/mental-health-first-aid/#:~:text=Mental%20Health%20First%20Aid%20is%20offered%20in%20the%20form%20of,their%20impact%2C%20and%20overviews%20common) _that can lead to great opportunities with volunteering with families, homes, and kids. What you feel are your best attributes, could then be given back to someone else._
