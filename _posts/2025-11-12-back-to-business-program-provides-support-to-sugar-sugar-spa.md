Claudia McGinnis's journey in skincare began in 2008 at a dermatology clinic, where she discovered her passion for the industry. Her dedication led her to open Sugar Sugar Spa, which recently received support from the Back to Business program. This initiative is designed to assist small businesses in Seattle, helping them recover and thrive post-pandemic. The program aims to provide resources and funding to entrepreneurs like McGinnis, enhancing their ability to serve the community and grow their businesses.
