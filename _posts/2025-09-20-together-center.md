The Center is also hosting a Senior Art Show in collaboration with the Redmond Senior & Community Center from November 6, 2025, to February 27, 2026. Artists aged 50 and above can submit any 2D artwork with no specific theme required. The submission deadline is October 3, 2025. The TC Garage will remain open on September 19 and 20, with closure dates moved to November 28 and 29.
