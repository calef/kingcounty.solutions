This fall, Neighborhood House will rename its Rainier Vista location The Wilcox Center in honor of Shirley and Louis Wilcox for their significant contributions to the community. Shirley, who began as a volunteer, became the first Black Board President in 1954, leading transformative changes such as the incorporation of Neighborhood House as a nonprofit and relocating its offices to Yesler Terrace, fostering partnerships between human services and public housing. She was also a founding president of Central Area Mental Health and a dedicated educator and advocate for social justice.

Louis, a music teacher, inspired at-risk youth by forming the Neighborhood House Band and mentoring students at his Wilcox Music Studio, where he hosted memorable recitals. He actively volunteered with local food banks, addressing food insecurity in the community.

Their legacy is one of resilience, growth, and hope, continuing to inspire Neighborhood House's mission of providing education, health care, and support to families. The renaming event on October 7 will celebrate their enduring values of compassion, equity, and courage, reflecting their profound impact on the community and the organization’s ongoing commitment to serve those in need.
