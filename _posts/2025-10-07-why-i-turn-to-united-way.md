Michelle Heertje, a resident of Auburn, shares her experience with the United Way of King County's free tax preparation service after moving to the U.S. from the Netherlands. After struggling to file her taxes independently, she sought help from United Way, which has assisted her ever since. The service, funded by United Way, the IRS, and the city of Seattle, is available for residents with incomes up to $80,000 (or $96,000 for non-single filers). This year, United Way helped 18,200 clients access more than $16 million in tax credits and refunds. The organization also launched MyFreeTaxesWA.org to connect individuals with statewide tax assistance. United Way is currently looking for volunteers for more than 20 tax prep locations in King County, offering both in-person and virtual opportunities. Heertje appreciates the convenience of virtual tax services, stating that she has consistently received refunds and feels relieved by the accuracy and support provided. As a former social worker now focusing on her family and volunteer work, she finds the service invaluable, especially considering the high costs of tax preparation in Washington state. United Way tax sites will open on Jan. 25, and they are actively recruiting volunteers.
