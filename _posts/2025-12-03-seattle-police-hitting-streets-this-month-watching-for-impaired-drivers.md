Seattle police will actively monitor the streets this month for impaired drivers as part of a focused initiative to enhance road safety. Officers will conduct DUI emphasis patrols throughout December, particularly during the holiday season when incidents of impaired driving often increase. The campaign aims to deter drunk and drugged driving through heightened enforcement efforts. Drivers caught under the influence will face legal consequences, including arrest and potential charges. The Seattle Police Department emphasizes the importance of responsible driving and encourages the public to utilize rideshare services or designated drivers if they plan to consume alcohol. This initiative aligns with broader efforts to reduce traffic-related incidents and promote safer driving habits in the community.
