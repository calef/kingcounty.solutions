This week, King County Solutions published 20 posts highlighting important community initiatives and updates. With the holiday season approaching, local efforts to support businesses, enhance public health, and combat food insecurity are particularly relevant, fostering a sense of community and resilience.

### Support for Local Businesses and Economy
Seattle's commitment to economic recovery is evident through initiatives like the [Back to Business Program](https://bottomline.seattle.gov/2025/11/12/back-to-business-program-provides-support-to-sugar-sugar-spa/) which recently aided Sugar Sugar Spa. This program is vital for helping small businesses thrive post-pandemic. Additionally, the [2026 Technology Matching Fund Grants](https://frontporch.seattle.gov/2025/11/12/application-open-for-city-of-seattles-2026-technology-matching-fund-grants/) are now open for applications, providing up to $45,000 to non-profits aimed at closing the digital divide. These grants are crucial for enhancing digital literacy in our communities.

### Community Engagement and Holiday Events
Seattle Parks and Recreation is gearing up for the festive season with a variety of [holiday events](https://parkways.seattle.gov/2025/11/13/2025-holiday-events-with-seattle-parks-and-recreation/) designed to engage residents of all ages. Events like the Community Holiday Party and the Pathway of Lights at Green Lake offer opportunities for celebration and connection. Meanwhile, Encompass NW hosted a [Confidence Camp: Halloween Edition](https://encompassnw.org/building-bravery-and-belonging-at-confidence-camp-halloween-edition/) for neurodiverse children, helping them build confidence and social skills in a supportive environment.

### Public Health Concerns and Responses
Public health remains a priority as the [H5N5 avian influenza](https://doh.wa.gov/newsroom/h5n5-avian-influenza-confirmed-grays-harbor-county-resident) was confirmed in a Grays Harbor County resident, marking the first human case of this strain. Health officials are monitoring the situation closely, emphasizing that the risk to the public is low. Additionally, the [Department of Health](https://doh.wa.gov/newsroom/state-revokes-suspends-licenses-certifications-registrations-health-care-providers-37) has taken action against several healthcare providers for misconduct, reinforcing the importance of accountability in health services.

### Food Security Initiatives
In response to recent SNAP cuts, the City of Mercer Island has received a [$30,000 donation](https://www.mercerisland.gov/yfs/page/city-mercer-island-receives-30000-donation-miyfs-foundation-support-food-security) from the MIYFS Foundation to support food security for affected households. This initiative will provide grocery cards to over 200 families in need. Furthermore, the Department of Youth and Family Services is [accepting donations](https://www.mercerisland.gov/yfs/page/yfs-accepting-donations-help-island-residents-experiencing-food-insecurity) to assist residents facing food insecurity, showcasing community solidarity during challenging times.
