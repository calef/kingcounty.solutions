This week, King County Solutions tracked 29 public-sector updates for November 9–15. With a federal shutdown and SNAP disruptions squeezing household budgets, local governments, nonprofits, and transit agencies are moving quickly to shore up food access, housing stability, and mobility as we head into the holidays.

### Food security and holiday support amid SNAP disruptions

Across the Eastside and South King County, partners are filling gaps left by delayed and reduced SNAP benefits. Bellevue LifeSpring is providing emergency grocery vouchers so low-income students can buy food directly from local stores, described in its update on preventing hunger being at the heart of its mission at [Bellevue LifeSpring](https://www.bellevuelifespring.org/general/the-heart-of-our-mission/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-heart-of-our-mission). On Mercer Island, the city’s Youth and Family Services team is using a $30,000 gift from the MIYFS Foundation to fund biweekly grocery cards for more than 200 households, detailed in the city’s announcement on [food security support](https://www.mercerisland.gov/yfs/page/city-mercer-island-receives-30000-donation-miyfs-foundation-support-food-security).

Mercer Island YFS is also asking residents to donate $25 grocery gift cards and is partnering with Hopelink’s Mobile Market to keep fresh food flowing to island families, as outlined in its call for [donations to help residents experiencing food insecurity](https://www.mercerisland.gov/yfs/page/yfs-accepting-donations-help-island-residents-experiencing-food-insecurity). Countywide, United Way of King County is backing community-led holiday events like Glover Empower Mentoring’s 15th Annual Thanksgiving Celebration, which will provide free meals, turkeys, coats, and gift cards to about 300 families, highlighted in United Way’s story [For the Community, For the Holidays](https://www.uwkc.org/breaking-the-cycle-of-poverty-news/food-insecurity/for-the-community-for-the-holidays/).

### Housing stability and homelessness prevention efforts

Catholic Community Services marked the second anniversary of St. Margaret’s Place in Shoreline, where 100 affordable units—including 20 reserved for veterans—are helping residents move from homelessness to stability, as profiled in CCS’s feature on [St. Margaret’s Place Apartments](https://ccsww.org/veterans-find-a-permanent-home-at-st-margarets-place-apartments/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=veterans-find-a-permanent-home-at-st-margarets-place-apartments). CCS also received a $50,000 Boeing Employees Community Fund grant to buy a new van for its Housing and Essential Needs program, improving delivery of rent assistance, hygiene supplies, and ORCA Lift cards to more than 4,000 King County residents, described in [this update](https://ccsww.org/boeing-grant-helps-ccs-hen-program-deliver-essential-supplies/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=boeing-grant-helps-ccs-hen-program-deliver-essential-supplies).

At the state level, the Department of Commerce’s Community Reinvestment Program is opening three new grant streams for reentry services, legal assistance, and local advisory teams, with awards up to $1.23 million to community organizations, outlined in its [November CRP update](https://www.commerce.wa.gov/crp-update-november-2025/). In Seattle, Councilmember Cathy Moore Rinck and regional partners are pushing back on Trump administration changes to HUD’s Continuum of Care rules that could destabilize housing for nearly 4,500 local households; Rinck is proposing $11.8 million in city funds to keep key programs running, detailed in the council’s statement [condemning the funding changes](https://council.seattle.gov/2025/11/14/councilmember-rinck-joins-with-king-county-state-and-homelessness-leaders-to-condemn-trump-administration-changes-to-critical-funding-keeping-people-housed/).

### Transit expansion, accessibility, and sustainable design

Sound Transit is preparing to open new Link light rail stations in South King County on December 6, emphasizing green building and equity. The agency reports that the stations use recycled materials, cut energy use by 18%, and are on track for Envision Platinum and LEED Silver certifications, as described in its piece on [sustainability at the new stations](https://www.soundtransit.org/blog/platform/building-greener-future-sustainability-our-new-south-king-county-stations). Riders will also be greeted by community-inspired public art at Federal Way, Kent, and Star Lake stations, highlighted in Sound Transit’s feature [Art in Motion](https://www.soundtransit.org/blog/platform/art-motion-new-public-art-welcomes-riders-along-1-line-extension).

King County Metro is pairing expansion with accessibility upgrades. Executive Shannon Braddock announced improvements to Metro’s Access paratransit service—such as easier reservations, better on-time performance, and pilots for grocery delivery and same-day trips—to support riders with disabilities in rural communities, detailed in Metro’s update on [Access paratransit upgrades](https://kingcountymetro.blog/2025/11/14/executive-braddock-announces-upgrades-to-metros-access-paratransit-service-improving-freedom-and-flexibility-for-riders-with-disabilities-living-in-rural-communities/). For weekend riders, Metro also flagged construction detours and event-related changes in its [November 14–16 weekend update](https://kingcountymetro.blog/2025/11/14/metro-weekend-update-november-14-16-2025/).

### Veterans, elders, and disability-focused services

With Veterans Day this week, King County Metro spotlighted four employees who served in the armed forces and now keep the transit system running, in a profile on [recognizing the service of Metro veterans](https://kingcountymetro.blog/2025/11/10/recognizing-the-service-of-metro-veterans/). Catholic Community Services’ story on [St. Margaret’s Place](https://ccsww.org/veterans-find-a-permanent-home-at-st-margarets-place-apartments/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=veterans-find-a-permanent-home-at-st-margarets-place-apartments) underscores how dedicated veteran units and on-site support can break cycles of homelessness.

For older adults, the Chinese Information & Service Center shared the latest Community Living Connections newsletter, summarizing resources and programs for seniors across King County, available through the [CLC November–December newsletter](https://cisc-seattle.org/clc-newsletter-november-to-december-2025/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=clc-newsletter-november-to-december-2025). Metro’s [Access paratransit enhancements](https://kingcountymetro.blog/2025/11/14/executive-braddock-announces-upgrades-to-metros-access-paratransit-service-improving-freedom-and-flexibility-for-riders-with-disabilities-living-in-rural-communities/) also double as a major investment in independence for seniors and riders with disabilities, particularly in rural parts of the county.
