Seattle voters are presented with two critical propositions on the November 4 ballot aimed at addressing the city's budget deficit and protecting essential services. Proposition 1 seeks to double the Families, Education, Preschool, and Promise (FEPP) Levy, expected to generate $1.3 billion over six years for educational and family support programs. Proposition 2, known as the Seattle Shield Initiative, aims to restructure the Business and Occupancy Tax, generating approximately $80 million annually while reducing tax burdens on small businesses. This initiative would increase tax exemptions for businesses earning up to $2 million, ensuring that the majority pay less, while larger companies contribute more.

These measures come at a time when Seattle faces a projected $150 million budget deficit by 2026, compounded by potential federal cuts to Medicaid and SNAP benefits, threatening the welfare of many residents. Mayor Bruce Harrell's budget relies on the approval of both propositions to prevent severe cuts to housing and human services. While these initiatives won't completely solve the budget issues or federal funding losses, they represent a vital step towards safeguarding community well-being and educational opportunities for Seattle's children and families.
