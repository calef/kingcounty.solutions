Thank you to the community for supporting Boyer Children’s Clinic during the 2025 Inspiring Journeys Gala, which raised a record-breaking $813,000. This remarkable achievement ensures Boyer continues to be a vital resource for families. The success of the event was made possible by the contributions of current and alumni families, guests, sponsors, donors, volunteers, the Board of Directors, the Advisory Council, and community supporters. As Boyer enters a new chapter, ongoing partnership with the community is crucial for its mission. Those interested in future event sponsorship opportunities can reach out to Ellen Kuo, Chief Development Officer. Contributions have a significant impact, as illustrated by the story of Vivian and Violet, showcasing how support transforms the lives of children and families served by Boyer.
