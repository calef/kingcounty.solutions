Thousands of King County residents face challenges affording basic hygiene items such as soap, toothpaste, laundry detergent, and menstrual products. The King County Council is currently considering a $50,000 proviso in the 2026-2027 budget to study hygiene poverty and develop data-driven solutions. This initiative aims to address hygiene poverty and establish a foundation for sustainable recommendations in future budget cycles, promoting equitable access to hygiene products.

Community members are urged to support this funding by attending a Budget Town Hall on Nov. 12, 2025, from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. at the King County Courthouse or remotely. Participants can also share their support by emailing their King County council members, emphasizing that hygiene is a human right and advocating for the proposed funding. Personal stories can enhance these messages, highlighting the importance of access to hygiene products. The advocacy effort seeks to ensure that everyone in King County can access essential hygiene items, reinforcing the dignity and well-being of all residents.
