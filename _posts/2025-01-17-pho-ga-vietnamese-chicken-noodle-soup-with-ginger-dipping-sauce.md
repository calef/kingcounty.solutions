Pho Ga is a Vietnamese chicken noodle soup accompanied by a ginger dipping sauce, yielding four servings. The recipe requires a whole chicken, fresh ginger, shallots, and various spices to create a flavorful broth. After roasting the onion, shallots, and ginger, the chicken is cleaned and simmered with the aromatics and seasonings for about 30 minutes, then cooled and sliced. The broth is further cooked for an hour, strained, and seasoned to taste.

For garnishes, fried shallots, pickled onions, and serrano peppers are prepared. The pickling liquid consists of rice vinegar, sugar, and water. Fresh or dried flat rice noodles are soaked or untangled, then briefly boiled before assembly. Each bowl is layered with noodles, sliced chicken, pickled garnishes, and fresh herbs, topped with hot broth. Finally, a ginger fish sauce dipping sauce made with ginger, garlic, chili, fish sauce, sugar, and lime juice complements the dish. Pho Ga is served hot, allowing for a rich and bold flavor experience enhanced by the dipping sauce.
