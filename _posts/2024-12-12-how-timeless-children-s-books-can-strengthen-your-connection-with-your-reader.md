Children’s books evoke nostalgia, transporting readers back to cherished moments in their childhood. Reading these picture-filled tales fosters deep connections, both between tutors and students and between students and reading itself. Selecting a book that resonates with both the tutor and the student enhances this bond. Classic children's books serve as a bridge, allowing tutors to share personal stories and engage students in conversations about the story's relevance and enduring appeal. 

For tutors, reading beloved childhood books like *Corduroy* or *Where the Wild Things Are* not only eases them into lessons but also creates shared joy and excitement. These stories invite tutors to revisit their own childhood imaginations, making the reading experience rich and engaging. The act of reading becomes a shared exploration, where tutors model enthusiasm and curiosity, inspiring students to develop a love for reading.

Timeless children's books are not just educational tools; they are gateways to meaningful relationships and conversations, laying the groundwork for lifelong literacy and learning. Sharing favorite childhood stories can spark joy in young readers, setting the stage for their future love of literature.
