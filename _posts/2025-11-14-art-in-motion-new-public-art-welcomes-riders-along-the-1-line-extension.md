When the 1 Line opens to Federal Way on December 6, it will feature community-inspired public art reflecting the spirit and diversity of South King County. Each station, including Federal Way, Kent, and Star Lake, showcases unique artworks that tell local stories. The Sound Transit art program aimed to create spaces that connect communities and foster belonging. Artist-in-residence Sarah Kavage contributed to the project through community engagement and research. While most artworks will be ready by the opening, additional pieces are planned for 2026, ensuring the art program evolves alongside the transit line.
