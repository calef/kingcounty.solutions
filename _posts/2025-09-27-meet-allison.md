  _Allison, 2013_

  In 2009, Allison’s world shifted overnight. Just one month after graduating from high school, two days into a brand-new job, and in the middle of her sister’s wedding celebration, she received life-shattering news: she was diagnosed with leukemia.

  What should have been a season of joy and celebration suddenly became filled with fear, uncertainty, and what felt like endless hospital visits. Instead of preparing for college and enjoying the freedom of young adulthood, Allison found herself facing the greatest battle of her life. But in the midst of this upheaval, her family wasn’t alone. They found strength and stability through The National Children’s Cancer Society (NCCS), which provided financial and emotional support during her treatment from 2009 to 2011.

  As Allison began to recover, her experience with cancer inspired her to dream bigger. She wanted to dedicate her life to helping others the way so many had helped her. That dream led her to apply for the [Beyond the Cure Ambassador Scholarship](/scholarship), which eased the financial burden of attending college and pursuing her dreams. She began her studies at the University of Georgia, earning a degree in psychology, and later returned to Kennesaw State University to pursue her true calling, earning a Bachelor of Science in nursing.

  While in school, Allison poured her heart back into the community that had once lifted her up. As a Beyond the Cure Ambassador, she wrote educational blogs about cancer and survivorship for the NCCS website, offering insight and hope to other survivors. She also created educational materials for NCCS’ sun safety program, Sun-Day Fun-Day, equipping elementary school students with tools to protect themselves against the sun’s harmful rays and live healthier lives.

  Today, Allison is living proof of resilience and purpose. She is a registered nurse at an infusion and cancer center, where her care for patients is deeply personal. In March of 2025, she proudly earned her Oncology Certified Nurse (OCN) credential, a milestone that affirms both her expertise and her passion for serving those battling cancer.

  Beyond her professional achievements, Allison’s life is filled with joy and love. She and her husband are raising two young children, all while he is in medical school! Together, they are building a family rooted in compassion, care, and the belief that even the hardest challenges can give rise to extraordinary strength.

  Allison continues to support the NCCS community by serving on the Beyond the Cure Ambassador Scholarship judging panel, helping select and encourage the next generation of survivors who, like her, are determined to transform their challenges into opportunities for growth, hope, and healing.

Allison's life changed dramatically in 2009 when she was diagnosed with leukemia just after graduating high school. Instead of enjoying her new job and celebrating her sister's wedding, she faced the challenges of cancer treatment, which included numerous hospital visits. The National Children’s Cancer Society (NCCS) provided vital financial and emotional support during her treatment from 2009 to 2011. Inspired by her experience, Allison applied for the Beyond the Cure Ambassador Scholarship, which helped her pursue higher education. She attended the University of Georgia to study psychology and later earned a Bachelor of Science in nursing from Kennesaw State University. 

As a Beyond the Cure Ambassador, she contributed by writing educational blogs about cancer survivorship and creating materials for NCCS’s sun safety program. Currently a registered nurse at an infusion and cancer center, Allison became an Oncology Certified Nurse (OCN) in March 2025. She is also a mother of two and actively supports the NCCS community by serving on the scholarship judging panel, empowering the next generation of childhood cancer survivors. Allison embodies resilience and the belief that adversity can lead to extraordinary strength.
