Allison's life changed dramatically in 2009 when she was diagnosed with leukemia just after graduating high school. Instead of enjoying her new job and celebrating her sister's wedding, she faced the challenges of cancer treatment, which included numerous hospital visits. The National Children’s Cancer Society (NCCS) provided vital financial and emotional support during her treatment from 2009 to 2011. Inspired by her experience, Allison applied for the Beyond the Cure Ambassador Scholarship, which helped her pursue higher education. She attended the University of Georgia to study psychology and later earned a Bachelor of Science in nursing from Kennesaw State University. As a Beyond the Cure Ambassador, she contributed by writing educational blogs about cancer survivorship and creating materials for NCCS’s sun safety program. Currently a registered nurse at an infusion and cancer center, Allison became an Oncology Certified Nurse (OCN) in March 2025. She is also a mother of two and actively supports the NCCS community by serving on the scholarship judging panel, empowering the next generation of childhood cancer survivors. Allison embodies resilience and the belief that adversity can lead to extraordinary strength.
