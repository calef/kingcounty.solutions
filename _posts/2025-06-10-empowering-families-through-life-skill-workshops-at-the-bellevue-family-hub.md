  <p>At Bellevue LifeSpring, we know that supporting children and fostering stability for families means more than just meeting urgent basic needs; it also means equipping parents and caregivers with the tools to navigate life’s everyday challenges.</p>



  <p>That’s why we offer free, family-focused life skill workshops in partnership with local organizations and businesses. Hosted at our Bellevue Family Hubs, these workshops are available both in person and virtually, with free childcare provided during in-person sessions.</p>



  <p><strong>Recent Highlights</strong></p>



  <p>In May, we partnered with <a href="https://elap.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eastside Legal Assistance Program</a> and the <a href="https://bellevuewa.gov/city-government/departments/community-development/conflict-resolution-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bellevue Conflict Resolution Center</a> to host a new workshop called <strong>Navigating Housing Challenges</strong>. For many families living in poverty, housing insecurity is a daily reality, and the fear of eviction can create chronic stress that impacts every area of life. </p>



  <p>Families in attendance learned practical tools to help prevent eviction, including how to communicate effectively with their landlords and navigate difficult conversations around housing. It was an empowering session that provided peace of mind and actionable steps for families facing housing insecurity. By demystifying the legal and communication processes involved in housing issues, families left the workshop feeling more prepared to advocate for themselves and avoid misunderstandings. For parents already balancing so much, this kind of knowledge can be a lifeline.</p>



  <p>This month, we dove into the complexities of parenting teens with a workshop called: <strong>The Science of Teen Decision-Making: Understanding the Adolescent Brain</strong>, presented in partnership with <a href="https://www.peps.org/">PEPs</a>. The session unpacked how brain development impacts teenage behavior and decision-making, offering research-backed strategies to help parents strengthen communication, reduce conflict, and build resilience in their teens.</p>



  <p>The workshop fostered greater empathy, patience, and confidence by helping parents and caregivers understand what’s happening in their teen’s brain. In a supportive, judgment-free space, families gained practical tools to navigate challenging moments, strengthening family bonds during one of the most formative stages of a child’s life.</p>



  <p><strong>Community Collaboration</strong></p>



  <p>We&#8217;re grateful for the opportunity to collaborate and host workshops alongside our community partners that empower families with essential knowledge and resources.</p>



  <p>If your business or organization has expertise to share and is interested in partnering, we’d love to hear from you! Together, we can empower more Bellevue families with the tools they need to succeed.</p>

At Bellevue LifeSpring, the focus is on equipping families with essential life skills through free workshops. These family-oriented sessions, available in person and virtually at Bellevue Family Hubs, aim to address everyday challenges faced by parents and caregivers. Recent workshops included "Navigating Housing Challenges," which provided families with tools to handle housing insecurity and effective communication with landlords, alleviating stress related to eviction fears. Another workshop, "The Science of Teen Decision-Making," explored adolescent brain development, offering parents strategies to improve communication and reduce conflict with their teens. Both workshops fostered a supportive environment, empowering families with practical knowledge to navigate life's complexities. Bellevue LifeSpring collaborates with local organizations to enhance these offerings and encourages partnerships to further support families in the community.
