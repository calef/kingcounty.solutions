---

At Bellevue LifeSpring, the focus is on equipping families with essential life skills through free workshops. These family-oriented sessions, available in-person and virtually at Bellevue Family Hubs, aim to address everyday challenges faced by parents and caregivers. Recent workshops included "Navigating Housing Challenges," which provided families with tools to handle housing insecurity and effective communication with landlords, alleviating stress related to eviction fears. Another workshop, "The Science of Teen Decision-Making," explored adolescent brain development, offering parents strategies to improve communication and reduce conflict with their teens. Both workshops fostered a supportive environment, empowering families with practical knowledge to navigate life's complexities. Bellevue LifeSpring collaborates with local organizations to enhance these offerings and encourages partnerships to further support families in the community.
