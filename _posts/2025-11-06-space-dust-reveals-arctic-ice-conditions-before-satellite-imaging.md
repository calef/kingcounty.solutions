  <p>Arctic sea ice has <a href="https://arctic.noaa.gov/report-card/report-card-2024/sea-ice-2024/">declined by more than 42% since 1979</a>, when regular satellite monitoring began. As the ice grows thinner and recedes, more water is exposed to sunlight. Ice reflects sunlight but dark water absorbs it, advancing warming and accelerating ice loss. Climate models indicate that the Arctic will <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/five-things-understand-about-ice-free-arctic">see ice-free summers</a> within the coming decades, and scientists still aren’t sure what this will mean for life on Earth.</p>
  <p>Researchers have known for some time that fine-grained dust from space blankets the surface of Earth, falling from the cosmos at a constant rate and settling into ocean sediments. A study <a href="http://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adv5767">published Nov. 6 in Science</a> shows that tracking where cosmic dust has fallen — and where it hasn’t — can reveal how sea ice coverage has changed over millennia.</p>
  <p>“If we can project the timing and spatial patterns of ice coverage decline in the future, it will help us understand warming, predict changes to food webs and fishing, and prepare for geopolitical shifts,” said <a href="https://environment.uw.edu/faculty/frankie-pavia/">Frankie Pavia</a>, a UW assistant professor of oceanography, who led the study.</p>

  <p>The three sites featured in the study “span a gradient of modern ice coverage,” Pavia said. The first, located near the North Pole, is covered year-round.

  <p>The researchers found that year-round ice coverage corresponded with less cosmic dust in the sediment. This was also observed during the last ice age, around 20,000 years ago. As Earth began to thaw, cosmic dust once again appeared in samples.</p>
  <p>The researchers then matched ice coverage to nutrient availability, showing that nutrient consumption peaked when sea ice was low and decreased as ice built up.</p>
  <p>The data on nutrient cycling comes from tiny shells once occupied by nitrogen digesters called <a href="https://ocean.si.edu/ocean-life/plankton/foraminifera">foraminifera</a>. Chemical analysis of these organisms’ shells shows what percentage of the total available nutrients were consumed when they were alive.</p>
  <p>“As ice decreases in the future, we expect to see increased consumption of nutrients by phytoplankton in the Arctic, which has consequences for the food web,” Pavia said.</p>
  <p>Additional research is needed to show what is driving changes in nutrient availability. One hypothesis suggests that sea ice decline increases the amount of nutrients used by surface organisms because there is more photosynthesis, but another argues that nutrients are diluted by ice melting.</p>
  <p>Both scenarios present as more consumption, but only the first indicates an increase in marine productivity.</p>

Ice coverage in the Arctic has decreased by over 42% since 1979, accelerating the melting process and altering nutrient availability in the region. A University of Washington study reveals that cosmic dust can be used to reconstruct Arctic ice conditions over the past 30,000 years. Researchers found that the accumulation of this space dust in ocean sediments correlates with sea ice coverage; when ice is present, cosmic dust is blocked from reaching the seafloor. By analyzing sediment cores from three sites with varying ice coverage, the team established a historical record of sea ice and its relationship to nutrient cycling. They observed that lower ice levels corresponded with higher nutrient consumption by marine organisms, specifically foraminifera. As the Arctic continues to warm, it is expected that phytoplankton will consume more nutrients due to increased sunlight exposure, significantly impacting the food web. The findings emphasize the importance of understanding past ice conditions to predict future ecological shifts and their consequences. Further research is needed to determine the factors influencing nutrient availability, with hypotheses suggesting either increased productivity or nutrient dilution resulting from melting ice.
