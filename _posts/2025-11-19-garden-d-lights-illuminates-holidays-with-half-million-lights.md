Celebrating its 31st year, Garden d’Lights will illuminate the Bellevue Botanical Garden from November 29 to December 31, excluding Christmas Day. This popular event features over half a million lights arranged in whimsical shapes, including plants, flowers, and animals, set against the garden's natural beauty. Live music from local groups will be featured on select nights, and the Copper Kettle Coffee Bar will offer hot drinks and snacks. Tickets are $10 on general admission nights, with special $5 nights on December 1-4 and December 8-11. Children aged 10 and under can enter for free, and tickets must be purchased in advance. Parking costs $5 per car, or is free with a disability permit, with additional free parking available at nearby Wilburton Hill Park. Attendees can also use the free BellHop shuttle service from downtown. Approximately 130 volunteers contributed over 6,400 hours to prepare the event, which is produced by the Bellevue Botanical Garden Society in partnership with Bellevue Parks & Community Services, with proceeds supporting garden improvements and educational programs. Amazon is this year’s presenting sponsor.
