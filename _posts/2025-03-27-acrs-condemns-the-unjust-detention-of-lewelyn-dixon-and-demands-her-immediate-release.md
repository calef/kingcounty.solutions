title: ACRS condemns the unjust detention of Lewelyn Dixon and demands her immediate
  release
topics: []

ACRS has condemned the unjust detention of Lewelyn Dixon, a long-time permanent U.S. resident and UW lab technician, who was detained at Seattle airport upon returning from the Philippines in February 2025. She was held for two days without explanation before being transferred to ICE custody at the Northwest Detention Center, where she currently remains without any charges or violations. Dixon’s attorney suggests her detention may be linked to an old conviction for a nonviolent offense from 2000, for which she fulfilled her court obligations. ACRS highlights that her detention exemplifies the harmful targeting of immigrants by federal enforcement agencies, which creates fear and separation within communities. They assert that Dixon’s dedication of over 50 years to the U.S. community should be recognized, not punished. ACRS is demanding her immediate release and is calling on elected leaders to expedite her court proceedings, as she faces a lengthy wait for her first hearing in July. They encourage community support through letters, petitions, and donations to assist with her legal fees and livelihood.
