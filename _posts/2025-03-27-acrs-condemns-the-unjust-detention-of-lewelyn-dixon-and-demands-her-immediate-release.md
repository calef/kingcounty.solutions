  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a service provider and trusted messenger to Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander community members, we are outraged by the escalating targeting and unjust detention of community members by federal immigration enforcement agencies. These actions are separating families, creating panic and distrust, and inflicting lasting harm on the mental health and well-being of our communities.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewelyn Dixon, a UW lab technician and permanent U.S. legal resident for over 50 years, was returning home to Seattle from the Philippines in February 2025 when she was detained at the airport. She was held there for two days without explanation before being transferred to ICE&#8217;s custody and sent to the Northwest Detention Center, where she remains. Lewelyn was denied a bail hearing and has to wait until July for her first hearing. Until then, she remains detained despite having no current charges or violations. </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewelyn&#8217;s attorney has publicly stated that federal immigration enforcement likely detained her due to an old conviction on her record upon her return. However, she had pleaded guilty to the nonviolent offense in 2000 and complied with the court’s orders to pay restitution. We do not doubt that Lewelyn&#8217;s unjust detention is another attempt by this administration to villainize immigrants as criminals and push their own political agenda.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lewelyn Dixon, along with all of our detained community members separated from their loved ones, deserves more. As our siblings at Tanggol Migrante Network have said, &#8220;She has entrusted this country with her life, labor, and talents. With over 50 years of her life dedicated to service to the people here, Auntie Lynn should be rewarded for her work. But instead, she is criminalized and discarded simply for being a migrant.&#8221;</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We demand the immediate release of Lewelyn Dixon from the custody of ICE and ask that our elected leaders do everything in their power to ensure that she is released. Her family has asked that, at the very least, she be given an earlier court date so she doesn&#8217;t remain detained for over three months at the Northwest Detention Center.</span></p>

ACRS has condemned the unjust detention of Lewelyn Dixon, a long-time permanent U.S. resident and UW lab technician, who was detained at Seattle airport upon returning from the Philippines in February 2025. She was held for two days without explanation before being transferred to ICE custody at the Northwest Detention Center, where she currently remains without any charges or violations. Dixon’s attorney suggests her detention may be linked to an old conviction for a nonviolent offense from 2000, for which she fulfilled her court obligations. ACRS highlights that her detention exemplifies the harmful targeting of immigrants by federal enforcement agencies, which creates fear and separation within communities. They assert that Dixon’s dedication of over 50 years to the U.S. community should be recognized, not punished. ACRS is demanding her immediate release and is calling on elected leaders to expedite her court proceedings, as she faces a lengthy wait for her first hearing in July. They encourage community support through letters, petitions, and donations to assist with her legal fees and livelihood.
