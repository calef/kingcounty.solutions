In celebration of Native American Heritage Month, the City of Bellevue and the nonprofit Unkitawa are hosting an event titled "Indigenous Ways of Knowing in Community" on November 14, from 6 to 8 p.m. at City Hall. The event features Indigenous educator Bawaajigekwe Boulley from the Bad River Ojibwe, who will present on "The Six Rs: Relationship, Respect, Responsibility, Relevance, Reciprocity, and Reverence." The presentation will explore how Indigenous knowledge emphasizes belonging, connection, and collective responsibility, encouraging participants to engage in storytelling and reflection that honors Native histories and contemporary leadership. Attendees will have the opportunity to connect with others in a mix-and-mingle format before the presentation. The event will conclude with a round dance, inviting all guests to participate. Preregistration is required to attend this community-focused celebration.
