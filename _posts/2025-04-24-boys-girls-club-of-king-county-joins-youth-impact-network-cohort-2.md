Boys & Girls Clubs of King County has been selected to join the Youth Impact Network, a national initiative beginning in May 2025. Over 14 months, the organization will collaborate with Boys & Girls Clubs of America and other peer clubs to enhance the quality and consistency of the Club Experience. Carlee Hoover, Program Services Director, and Nerrisah Townsend, Area Director, will lead this initiative, focusing on staff development, youth experience, and ongoing program improvement. The Youth Impact Network includes monthly coaching sessions, in-person workshops at BGCA's National Conferences, training in youth development practices, and support for data-driven improvements. The initiative aims to foster a culture of continuous learning, data-driven decision-making, and community engagement. Hoover emphasizes the importance of utilizing data to remove barriers and strengthen relationships, creating an environment where every young person feels a sense of belonging and growth. This commitment to investing in youth is seen as a broader investment in the community, with the goal of building a stronger future together.
