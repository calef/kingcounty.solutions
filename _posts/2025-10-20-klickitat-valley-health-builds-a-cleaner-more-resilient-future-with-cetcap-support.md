Klickitat Valley Health (KVH), a rural hospital in Goldendale, Washington, is launching several energy resilience projects between 2022 and 2027 with support from the Washington Clean Energy Tax Credit Assistance Program (CETCAP). These projects, which include microgrid development, ground source heat pump retrofitting, central utility plant upgrade, hydrogen fuel cell installation, energy efficiency retrofits, and the addition of 10 electric vehicle charging stations, are being financed through a mix of federal and state grants, local funding and investment tax credits. CETCAP's support helped KVH qualify for an estimated tax credit of $5-6 million. The projects are expected to increase energy efficiency, reduce natural gas usage, create jobs, and improve public trust in clean energy.
