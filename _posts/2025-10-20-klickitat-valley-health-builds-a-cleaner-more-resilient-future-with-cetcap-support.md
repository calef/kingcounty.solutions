  > “Elective pay finally makes clean energy real for rural hospitals. Without it, our hydrogen fuel cell wouldn’t have been feasible.” – Jonathan Lewis, Director of Support Services, KVH

  ## Project overview

  Klickitat Valley Health (KVH) is a rural critical access hospital located in Goldendale, about 13 miles north of the Oregon border. With a staff of 200, KVH has launched several energy resilience projects scheduled for phased completion between 2022 and 2027:

  - Microgrid development (solar + battery)
  - Ground source heat pump retrofitting
  - Central utility plant upgrade
  - Hydrogen fuel cell installation
  - Energy efficiency retrofits (lighting, insulation, controls)
  - 10 electric vehicle (EV) charging stations

  KVH is financing these projects through a combination of federal and state grants, the Department of Ecology, local funding, and funds from the 48: investment tax credit.

  ## Technical assistance provided

  With an estimated $16 million total cost across multiple project phases, KVH leveraged legal and filing support through CETCAP partners Avisen Legal and Giraffe Financial. Through the program, CETCAP was able to determine elective pay eligibility, prepare filings, and deliver a cost segregation analysis – ultimately resulting in KVH qualifying for an estimated tax credit amount of $5-6 million.

  ## Outcomes and impact

  Klickitat Valley Health expects to see the following benefits from these energy projects:

  - Estimated 700,000 kWh/year solar offset
  - Central utility plant efficiency increase of 30%
  - Hydrogen fuel cell provides 100 kilowatt (kW) peak capacity
  - 93% natural gas usage reduction with ground source heat pump
  - EnergyStar portfolio manager score of 100; EUI of 154
  - 10 temporary new construction jobs; 1 new full-time O&M position
  - Improved public trust and increased clean energy visibility in rural WA

  ## Washington Clean Energy Tax Credit Assistance Program (CETCAP)

  In partnership with Lawyers for Good Government and Giraffe Financial, the Washington Clean Energy Tax Credit Assistance Program (CETCAP) team has helped more than 150 organizations statewide secure hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax credits by providing legal and filing assistance for hundreds of projects.
