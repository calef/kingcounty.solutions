The Rainier Valley Food Bank (RVFB) expressed gratitude for the overwhelming support received during GivingTuesday 2024, where they raised over $110,000 to enhance food access for all community members, irrespective of their backgrounds. The initiative aimed to reaffirm RVFB's commitment to providing a safe resource for individuals regardless of housing status, income, or immigration status. More than 200 local supporters contributed to surpassing the fundraising goal, demonstrating the community's dedication to ending hunger in South Seattle. RVFB acknowledged the media coverage from outlets like Seattle Business Magazine, South Seattle Emerald, and KUOW, which highlighted their efforts alongside other nonprofit organizations. The organization emphasized that the fight against hunger continues and encouraged those who missed the GivingTuesday opportunity to still contribute. They offered various ways for community members to get involved, including volunteering, becoming monthly donors, hosting drives, and spreading awareness about food access issues. RVFB remains committed to working collaboratively with the community to address hunger challenges in South Seattle.
