---

Nikita Sharma volunteers at Broadview Shelter and Transitional Housing, where she supports children and parents escaping domestic violence and homelessness. Her favorite part of volunteering is when children feel safe enough to express themselves freely, even if it means getting rowdy. Over 1,100 volunteers contributed nearly 23,000 hours to various projects, including tutoring and gardening, to help the community. Nikita, who started volunteering after relocating to Seattle for work, found meaning and stability during a challenging period in her life. She engages in diverse activities like distributing lunches, tutoring, and leading fun games to foster healthy relationships and social-emotional skills among children. Her efforts are appreciated by both the children, who enjoy her presence, and her colleagues, who recognize her ability to connect and adapt to various needs. Nikita values the relationships she has built, especially with the children who initially struggle to engage. She finds it rewarding to be a safe space for them, cherishing the trust they place in her when they share their stories. Despite returning to work, she continues to volunteer, emphasizing the importance of the community and the connections she has made at Broadview.
