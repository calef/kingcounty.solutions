  <p>Good Morning YouthCare Friends &amp; Family,</p>



  <p>Today, YouthCare is announcing the six-member transition team that will lead the organization in refocusing programmatic efforts and financial systems to best align with its core mission. We feel this is an important step in setting YouthCare up for a long, successful future. I am excited to help lead this team as Interim CEO, pulling from my long history of working to fight homelessness in King County, including as Executive Director at Mary’s Place.</p>



  <p>Joining me in these efforts are Alison Dean, Jackie Liao, Rob Stewart, Kristi Tollner and William J. Wiggins, names you will no doubt recognize as strong leaders in our community who share the mission, vision and values of YouthCare. For those who might not know them as well, I’ve included short bios for all of them at the bottom of this email.</p>



  <p>I am so grateful for the staff and volunteers who have worked diligently to carry out YouthCare’s mission for so many years. They will continue to be an important part of revitalizing the organization so that it may continue to serve hundreds of unhoused youth every year.</p>



  <p>I am committed to transparency and open communication throughout this process, which will begin with focusing on a 60 day plan in conjunction with our board and staff to develop a clear strategy for the organization. We expect to be able to share more insights into this plan by October. Myself and members of the transition team will simultaneously be engaging with city and county leaders, community members, unhoused youth and YouthCare supporters in the spirit of collaboration which has made YouthCare such a well-respected organization in the region.</p>



  <p>YouthCare was founded in 1974 by a couple who sought to take action and prevent the trauma caused by youth homelessness. For more than 50 years, YouthCare has continued those efforts, expanding its staff, programs and footprint.&nbsp;It is with that spirit and intentions in mind that we embark on this new journey together. Stability and hope are not just within reach for YouthCare, they are ahead of us, because this community believes in our mission and in the limitless potential of the young people we serve.</p>



  <p>I welcome the opportunity to connect with you. Please reach out if you have any questions or would like a personal update: <a href="mailto:marty.hartman@youthcare.org">marty.hartman@youthcare.org</a>.</p>
