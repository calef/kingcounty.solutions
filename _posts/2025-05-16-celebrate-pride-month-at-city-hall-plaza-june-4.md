In celebration of Pride Month, the City of Bellevue and Pride Across the Bridge are hosting "Pride on the Plaza" on June 4 from noon to 2 p.m. at City Hall. The free event will feature music, food, and performances showcasing local queer artists. It will begin with a pride flag raising ceremony and remarks from city leaders, including a keynote address by Edgar Longoria, executive director of Entre Hermanos. Attendees can enjoy music from a live DJ and light refreshments, as well as visit resource tables offering information to support the LGBTQIA+ community.

Axton Burton, executive director of Pride Across the Bridge, expressed pride in collaborating with Bellevue to create inclusive spaces for the community. Mayor Lynne Robinson reaffirmed the city’s commitment to inclusivity and diversity. Additional activities include Pride banners along the Grand Connection in downtown Bellevue, and the Bellevue Downtown Association will host the Paws and Pride Dog Walk on May 31. The City Council will recognize Pride Month with a proclamation on June 3. For those needing accommodations or alternate formats, contact the city in advance.
