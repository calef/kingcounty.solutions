  <h2>If confirmed, this would be the first human case of avian influenza reported in Washington in 2025</h2>

  <p><strong>OLYMPIA</strong>&nbsp;– A Grays Harbor County resident has tested preliminarily positive for <a href="https://doh.wa.gov/you-and-your-family/illness-and-disease-z/avian-influenza">avian influenza</a>, also known as bird flu. Confirmatory testing through the Washington State Public Health Laboratories is pending.</p>

  <p>Health officials are working to determine the potential sources of the infection, including contact with wild or domestic birds. The person, who is an older adult with underlying health conditions, developed a high fever, confusion, and respiratory distress and was hospitalized in early November. They are currently receiving treatment in King County after previously being treated in Thurston and Grays Harbor counties.</p>

  <p>Public health disease experts have not identified any risk to the public. The Washington State Department of Health is working with the local health departments and healthcare facilities to support the investigation.</p>

  <p><strong>About Avian Influenza</strong></p>

  <p><a href="https://doh.wa.gov/you-and-your-family/illness-and-disease-z/avian-influenza">Avian influenza</a> is a disease caused by influenza type A viruses, which naturally occur in wild aquatic birds around the world. These viruses can infect other bird species, and, occasionally mammals, and can be deadly to domestic birds such as chickens and turkeys.&nbsp;On rare occasions, avian influenza viruses can infect people and make them sick. Most cases have occurred in people who were exposed to sick or infected animals. Reported human cases of avian influenza in the United States have typically been mild, with symptoms such as conjunctivitis (red eyes), fever, and respiratory symptoms.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The risk of avian influenza increases in the fall and winter because migratory birds can carry the virus and spread it to domestic animals including commercial poultry farms and backyard flocks.</p>

  <p>Transmission of avian influenza between humans is extremely rare and has never been documented in the United States. To ensure that human-to-human spread is not occurring, public health officials are contacting anyone who has been in close contact with the patient to monitor for symptoms and provide testing and treatment as needed.</p>

  <p><strong>Public Health Guidance</strong></p>

  <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) currently considers the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html">risk to the public from avian influenza to be low</a>. However, people who work with or have recreational contact with infected birds, cattle, or other potentially infected domestic or wild animals, are at higher risk and should take precautions, including wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, masks, eye protection, and fluid-resistant coveralls or other outerwear.</p>

  <p>People with backyard poultry should avoid contact with &nbsp;sick or dead birds and report illness to the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) by calling 1-800-606-3056 or&nbsp;<a href="https://arcg.is/05KT8S">reporting online.</a> Veterinarians <a href="https://fortress.wa.gov/agr/apps/rad/">should report sick or dead domestic animals or livestock</a> suspected of having avian influenza to WSDA.&nbsp;Avoid contact with sick or dead wildlife and report sick or dead wild birds or other animals to the&nbsp;<a href="https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/1550804e5fd743668049e06d5ad8836a">Washington State Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife. </a>&nbsp;Never handle or allow pets near dead birds or other wildlife.</p>

  <p>Avoid eating raw or undercooked food products, such as unpasteurized (raw) milk or raw cheeses, and don’t feed these products to pets.</p>

  <p>It is especially important that people who may have exposure to sick birds get a seasonal flu vaccine. While the seasonal flu vaccine will not prevent bird flu infection, it reduces the risk of becoming sick with both human and avian influenza viruses at the same time. Seasonal flu vaccine is recommended for everyone six months and older.</p>
