The Seattle Department of Education & Early Learning (DEEL) is hosting Community Conversations in December to discuss the renewal of the Families, Education, Preschool & Promise Levy (FEPP). Following the passage of Prop 1, Seattle will implement a six-year spending plan in 2026 aimed at supporting children, youth, and families. Community members are invited to attend events to learn about proposed investments in childcare and education while sharing their priorities. The Every Child Ready Community Conversation Series will take place at various locations: 

- December 2, 5:30–7:30 PM at Magnuson Community Center
- December 10, 5:30–7:30 PM at Ballard Branch – Seattle Public Library
- December 11, 5:30–7:30 PM at Denny International Middle School
- December 16, 5:30–7:30 PM at Rainier Community Center

Events are family-friendly, featuring free dinner, interpretation services, and activities for children. Attendance is limited, and RSVPs are encouraged. DEEL aims to gather community feedback on how the levy can enhance access to affordable childcare, high-quality preschool, K-12 supports, and college and career opportunities.
