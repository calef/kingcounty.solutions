The Seattle Department of Education & Early Learning (DEEL) is hosting a series of Community Conversations in December to discuss the renewal of the Families, Education, Preschool & Promise Levy (FEPP). This initiative is part of a six-year spending plan set to begin in 2026, aimed at supporting children, youth, and families in Seattle. The events will cover planned investments in childcare and education, offering families an opportunity to express their priorities. 

The community events will be family-friendly, providing free dinner, interpretation services, and activities for children. Scheduled meetings will take place on December 2 at Magnuson Community Center, December 10 at Ballard Branch of the Seattle Public Library, December 11 at Denny International Middle School, and December 16 at Rainier Community Center, all from 5:30 to 7:30 PM. Due to limited space, attendees are encouraged to RSVP. DEEL aims to gather community input on how the levy can enhance access to affordable childcare, high-quality preschool, K-12 support, and college and career opportunities. More information can be found on DEEL’s levy renewal webpage or by contacting the department directly.
