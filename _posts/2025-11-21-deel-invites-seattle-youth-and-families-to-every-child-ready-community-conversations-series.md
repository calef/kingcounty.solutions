The Seattle Department of Education & Early Learning (DEEL) is hosting the Every Child Ready Community Conversations series this December to discuss the renewal of the Families, Education, Preschool & Promise Levy (FEPP). The city will implement a six-year spending plan starting in 2026 to support children, youth, and families. Community members are invited to participate in these events to learn about upcoming investments in childcare and education while sharing their priorities. 

The events are family-friendly, offering free dinners, interpretation services, and children's activities. Scheduled meetings are on December 2 at Magnuson Community Center, December 10 at Ballard Branch of Seattle Public Library, December 11 at Denny International Middle School, and December 16 at Rainier Community Center, all from 5:30 PM to 7:30 PM. Due to limited space, attendees are encouraged to RSVP. DEEL aims to engage the community to understand how the FEPP Levy can enhance access to affordable childcare, quality preschool, K-12 support, and college and career opportunities.
