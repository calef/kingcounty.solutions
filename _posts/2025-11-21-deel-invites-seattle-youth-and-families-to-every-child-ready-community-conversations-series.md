The Seattle Department of Education & Early Learning (DEEL) is hosting community conversations in December to discuss the renewal of the Families, Education, Preschool & Promise Levy (FEPP). The FEPP Levy, approved by voters, will fund a six-year plan starting in 2026 to support children, youth, and families in Seattle. Events will take place on December 2, 10, 11, and 16 at various locations, featuring family-friendly activities, free dinner, and interpretation services. These conversations aim to gather community input on priorities for investments in affordable childcare, quality preschool, K-12 support, and college and career opportunities. Attendance is limited, and RSVPs are encouraged. DEEL seeks to engage with the community to ensure the levy meets the needs of families in Seattle. Further details on the FEPP Levy renewal can be obtained by contacting DEEL directly.
