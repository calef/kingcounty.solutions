Deel invites Seattle youth and families to participate in the "Every Child Ready" Community Conversations Series. This initiative aims to engage the community in discussions about early childhood education and support systems. The series will focus on gathering input from families and youth to inform programs and services that enhance readiness for school and life. Participants will have the opportunity to share their experiences and perspectives, which will be used to shape future initiatives in the community. The conversations will be held at various locations throughout Seattle, making it accessible to a diverse range of participants. Deel emphasizes the importance of community involvement in creating a supportive environment for children and their families. By fostering collaboration and dialogue, the organization seeks to strengthen the foundation of early childhood education in the region. Families are encouraged to attend and contribute to these vital discussions, ensuring that their voices are heard in the planning and implementation of educational resources and support systems.
