The Seattle Department of Education & Early Learning (DEEL) is hosting a series of Community Conversations in December focused on the renewal of the Families, Education, Preschool & Promise Levy (FEPP). This initiative follows the passage of Prop 1, which will enable the City of Seattle to implement a six-year spending plan starting in 2026 to benefit children, youth, and families. The events aim to inform attendees about planned investments in childcare and education while gathering community input on priorities. The Every Child Ready Community Conversation Series will take place at four locations: Magnuson Community Center on December 2, Ballard Branch of the Seattle Public Library on December 10, Denny International Middle School on December 11, and Rainier Community Center on December 16, all from 5:30 to 7:30 PM. These family-friendly events will provide free dinner, interpretation services, and children's activities. Space is limited, and attendees are encouraged to RSVP. DEEL aims to understand community needs and enhance access to affordable childcare, high-quality preschool, K-12 supports, and college and career opportunities.
