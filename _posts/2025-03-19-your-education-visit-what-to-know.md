Your education visit focuses on engaging with children through play, which is essential for their learning. During the visit, there is no need for special toys; any home items that interest the child can be used. At the conclusion, goals may be established for future visits, and parents will receive advice on how to support their child's progress at home.

Parent coaching is a key service model where strategies are developed for parents to use independently with their children. This includes demonstrating play techniques, discussing challenging routines, and sharing insights about the child's learning style and development. The primary aim is to equip parents with effective tools for caregiving.

To ensure a successful visit, it is recommended to schedule it when the child is awake, minimize distractions, and have a caregiver present for the entire session. If there are any questions about the strategies discussed, parents are encouraged to reach out to their therapy team.

Children may receive support from multiple providers, such as occupational or speech therapists, to address various developmental areas, enhancing the effectiveness of their educational experience through teamwork.
