The Families, Education, Preschool, and Promise (FEPP) Levy in Seattle, originally approved in 2018, supports education programs from preschool to postsecondary, focusing on equity for marginalized groups. With the renewal (Proposition 1) on the ballot, voters can continue this essential funding, which aids Black, Indigenous, immigrant, refugee, and low-income youth facing barriers. The Levy funds early learning and childcare, K–12 academic and health services, and the Seattle Promise, which offers free community college tuition for graduates. The renewal proposes adding 800 new childcare slots, 600 more preschool seats, support for 5,000 childcare workers, and ongoing academic and health care services in K–12 schools.

Stories highlight the Levy's impact, such as a mother ensuring her child receives developmental support and a refugee family avoiding eviction through housing advocacy. The Levy not only benefits individual students but strengthens communities by reducing barriers and improving educational outcomes. Neighborhood House, a key partner in these efforts, utilizes FEPP funding for programs like afterschool initiatives that build skills and support youth, fostering family engagement and connections across generations. The collaboration aims to empower youth and enhance their opportunities for success.
