King County is launching Saturday water taxi service for Vashon Island starting October 11, adding eight round-trips between Pier 50 in Seattle and the Vashon Ferry Terminal. This expansion follows requests from residents and is supported by funding from the State Legislature, reflecting the growing demand for transit options. The new Saturday service includes additional Friday night sailings, enhancing connectivity to the mainland and providing more opportunities for recreation and exploration.

The water taxi fare is set at $7.00 for adults, with discounts available for those with an ORCA card, while passengers 18 and under can ride for free. The service will not operate on major holidays such as Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year’s Day. This initiative is part of a pilot program funded for one year, ending in October 2026. King County officials and local leaders express excitement about the expanded service, highlighting its potential to boost Vashon's local economy and community health. The project represents a significant milestone in improving transit options for island residents and visitors alike.
