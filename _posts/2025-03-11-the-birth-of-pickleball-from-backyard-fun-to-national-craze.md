Pickleball is rapidly gaining popularity across the U.S., becoming one of the fastest-growing sports, especially in the Pacific Northwest. This engaging game blends elements of badminton, pingpong, and tennis, making it accessible and enjoyable for players of all ages. Its social nature and low-impact physical activity appeal to many, prompting cities to invest in dedicated courts and leagues.

The sport originated on Bainbridge Island in 1965 when Congressman Joel Pritchard and his friend Bill Bell created it out of boredom after a golf game. They improvised with pingpong paddles and a plastic ball on an old badminton court. With the help of Barney McCallum, they refined the game, establishing rules and creating better paddles. By 1968, they founded Pickle Ball Inc. to promote the game.

After nearly two decades as a regional pastime, pickleball surged in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic, offering a socially distanced activity. The name "pickleball" has two conflicting origin stories: one links it to a "pickle boat" in crew, while another ties it to Pritchard's dog, Pickles, though the dog came after the game's invention. Today, pickleball remains a significant sport in the U.S.
