On Thanksgiving Day, the City of Seattle's Community Connect Resource System (CCRS) helped connect individuals experiencing homelessness with essential services, including shelters and hot meals. The initiative aimed to ensure that those in need could access warm meals and a safe place to stay during the holiday. Various local organizations and volunteers collaborated to provide these vital services, demonstrating community support and solidarity. The program's efforts included outreach to individuals in encampments and public spaces, emphasizing the importance of inclusivity and care for all residents. By facilitating access to resources, the CCRS aimed to alleviate some of the challenges faced by vulnerable populations during the holiday season. The initiative highlighted the ongoing commitment of the Seattle community to support its members in need, particularly on significant days like Thanksgiving.
