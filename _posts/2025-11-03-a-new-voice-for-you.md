Seattle City Light (SCL) and Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) have launched an upgraded customer care phone system aimed at enhancing customer service accessibility. The new system allows callers to select their preferred language right at the start of the call, with options including English, Spanish, Vietnamese, Cantonese, Mandarin, Somali, Tagalog, Korean, and an "Other languages" option for additional support. This initiative ensures that customers can communicate directly in their chosen language, streamlining the process and improving overall service efficiency.

The service includes free interpretation assistance, emphasizing the commitment to equity, respect, and accessibility for all customers. The upgrade reflects a dedication to listening to the community's needs and providing essential services with ease and confidence. Customers can call (206) 684-3000 to utilize the new features and receive support in their preferred language. This system aims to create a more inclusive environment, allowing every customer to feel heard and supported in their interactions with utility services.
