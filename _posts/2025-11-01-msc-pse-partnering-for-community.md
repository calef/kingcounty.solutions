Multi-Service Center (MSC) and Puget Sound Energy (PSE) have collaborated since 2002 to provide energy assistance to PSE customers in South King County. The PSE HELP program now offers over $24 million annually in direct benefits through bill credits for electricity and gas. Following the introduction of the Bill Discount Rate (BDR) program in 2023 and a shift to self-attestation, the number of households receiving assistance from MSC has significantly increased—from approximately 9,000 to over 33,000 in the last fiscal year. This surge is attributed to the simplified online application process and higher income eligibility thresholds for assistance. For example, while federal guidelines require a family of four to earn under $4,019 monthly for LIHEAP, they can qualify for PSE HELP with incomes up to $10,096. This flexibility helps additional households facing financial difficulties. Oksana Savolyuk, MSC’s Energy Assistance Director, emphasized the partnership's commitment to equitable access. Beyond energy assistance, PSE supports MSC through grants for food and housing programs and sponsorship of events.
