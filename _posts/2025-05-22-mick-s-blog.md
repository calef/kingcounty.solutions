At the age of 14, a survivor experienced sexual assault by her boyfriend but did not recognize it as such until years later. Despite being educated and politically aware, she grappled with cognitive dissonance, believing that not saying "no" equated to consent. Her abuser continued to harass her, prompting her to seek help after a distressing conversation. A call to a domestic violence hotline provided reassurance and clarity about emotional abuse and the nature of consent. She began Prolonged Exposure therapy at KCSARC, which proved challenging yet transformative. Sharing her story became easier, and she encourages others to speak out, highlighting the availability of resources for survivors. After years of struggle, she recently felt a renewed sense of hope about her future, which she attributes to her ongoing healing journey. Now studying gender-based violence and international human rights in college, she emphasizes the need for cultural change regarding sexual violence and urges open discussions within personal circles. She underscores the importance of listening to survivors, who are the true experts on their experiences, and reassures others that help is accessible and hope is attainable.
