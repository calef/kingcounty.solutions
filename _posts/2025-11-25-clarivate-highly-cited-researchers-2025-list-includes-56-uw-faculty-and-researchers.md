  <p>The University of Washington is proud to announce that 56 faculty and researchers who completed their work while at UW have been named on the <a href="https://clarivate.com/highly-cited-researchers/?campaignname=Highly_Cited_Researchers_SAR_Global_2022&amp;campaignid=7014N000001uvdq&amp;utm_campaign=Highly_Cited_Researchers_SAR_Global_2022&amp;utm_source=earned_coverage&amp;utm_medium=press">Highly Cited Researchers 2025</a> list from Clarivate.</p>
  <p>The annual list identifies researchers who demonstrated significant influence in their chosen field or fields through the publication of multiple highly cited papers during the last decade. Their names are drawn from the publications that rank in the top 1% by citations for field and publication year in the <a href="https://clarivate.com/academia-government/scientific-and-academic-research/research-discovery-and-referencing/web-of-science/web-of-science-core-collection/science-citation-index-expanded/">Web of Science citation index</a>.</p>
  <p>Highly Cited Researchers demonstrate significant and broad influence in their fields of research. The total list includes 7,131 awards from more than 1,300 institutions in 60 countries and regions. This small fraction of the global researcher population contributes disproportionately to extending the frontiers of knowledge and contributing to innovations that make the world healthier, more sustainable and which drive societal impact, according to Clarivate.</p>

title: Clarivate Highly Cited Researchers 2025 list includes 56 UW faculty and researchers
topics: []
---

The University of Washington (UW) has announced that 56 of its faculty and researchers have been recognized in the Highly Cited Researchers 2025 list by Clarivate. This prestigious annual list highlights researchers who have made significant impacts in their fields through the publication of highly cited papers over the last decade. The selection represents a small fraction of global researchers, with only 7,131 individuals from more than 1,300 institutions across 60 countries included in the list. These researchers are noted for their contributions to advancing knowledge and fostering innovations that enhance global health and sustainability. The list comprises individuals affiliated primarily with UW, as well as some associated with the Fred Hutch Cancer Center and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. Some individuals listed may no longer be with UW, and their current affiliations are mentioned. The determination of this list is based on bibliometric analyses conducted by experts at the Institute for Scientific Information at Clarivate.
