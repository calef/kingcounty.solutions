For nearly 40 years, Treehouse has supported children and youth in foster care, striving to ensure they graduate high school equipped for adulthood. Recently, the Washington State Legislature cut $7.46 million from Treehouse's funding, significantly affecting its budget. Despite this challenge, Treehouse remains committed to its mission, focusing on helping foster youth graduate at rates comparable to their peers. With support from OSPI Superintendent Chris Reykdal, who redirected $1.4 million in discretionary funding, Treehouse aims to sustain its services.

To adapt to the funding loss, Treehouse will concentrate its educational coaching services in areas with high concentrations of foster youth, while maintaining a statewide educational advocacy program, albeit with reduced capacity. The organization plans to streamline its services and integrate post-high school programs to provide continuous support. Additionally, Treehouse will continue to offer material and financial resources through various initiatives, funded largely by donations.

Treehouse is actively advocating for funding restoration in the upcoming state budget and emphasizes the importance of community support to maintain its services. The organization remains dedicated to empowering young people in foster care, ensuring they have the opportunities needed to thrive.
