Rubén Peralta reflects on his five years as a Program Officer at Inatai Foundation, highlighting the importance of authenticity in leadership and community engagement. He emphasizes the value of joy, stating it strengthens the pursuit of other values, even through challenges. Peralta shares a significant lesson learned: Inatai encourages him to embrace his identity, including his name's pronunciation, which fosters a sense of belonging. He appreciates that his diverse experiences as a formerly undocumented immigrant and bilingual educator are valued alongside his professional background. 

A notable community story for him is the rise of ELLA Adelante, a Latina-led organization empowering social justice in the Yakima Valley, which has successfully elected candidates and is cultivating community power. Peralta also cherishes Franklin County, especially Pasco, for its rich Mexican heritage, vibrant cultural celebrations, and authentic cuisine, underscoring its role as a home for many Latinx individuals in Washington.
