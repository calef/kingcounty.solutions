  When [Rubén Peralta](https://inatai.org/team/ruben-peralta/) joined Inatai Foundation five years ago as a Program Officer, he brought his whole self to this role. It’s those life experiences alongside his career as an educator and community engagement specialist that have made Rubén a compassionate, trustworthy, and strategic partner to grantee organizations. We asked him five questions for his five-year anniversary at Inatai.

  **1. Where is your favorite place in Washington?**

  Anywhere that has beautiful sunsets. We have some of the best in the Tri-Cities, but Port Townsend has some amazing ones featuring the ocean.

  **2. Which Inatai value resonates with you the most?**

  Joy. I think this value touches on the rest of them. Even those that might cause us pain as we seek to realize them, joy will give us the strength to persevere.

  **3. What is an important lesson you learned over the last five years?**

  I’m going to skip the work- and task-related lessons. The most important lesson and the one that has impacted me the most is that at Inatai, my colleagues want me to be who I am. I have an accent on my name, and everyone here knew it meant something; so people have asked me how to pronounce my name because they want to do it correctly.

Rubén Peralta reflects on his five years as a Program Officer at Inatai Foundation, highlighting the importance of authenticity in leadership and community engagement. He emphasizes the value of joy, stating it strengthens the pursuit of other values, even through challenges. Peralta shares a significant lesson learned: Inatai encourages him to embrace his identity, including his name's pronunciation, which fosters a sense of belonging. He appreciates that his diverse experiences as a formerly undocumented immigrant and bilingual educator are valued alongside his professional background. 

A notable community story for him is the rise of ELLA Adelante, a Latina-led organization empowering social justice in the Yakima Valley, which has successfully elected candidates and is cultivating community power. Peralta also cherishes Franklin County, especially Pasco, for its rich Mexican heritage, vibrant cultural celebrations, and authentic cuisine, underscoring its role as a home for many Latinx individuals in Washington.
