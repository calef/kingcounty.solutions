Since 2018, the Seattle Department of Education and Early Learning (DEEL) has engaged with the Children’s Funding Project, a national network focusing on voter-approved funding for children's services. This collaboration allows DEEL to connect with more than 25 other cities and counties to share best practices in service delivery, legislative advocacy, grant-making, and evaluation. A recent blog post by the Children’s Funding Project highlighted Seattle's efforts, particularly the Families, Education, Preschool, and Promise (FEPP) Levy, alongside initiatives in Cincinnati and two counties in Colorado seeking to renew or establish children’s funds. The Children’s Funding Project aims to enhance equitable opportunities for youth through strategic public financing. DEEL continues to explore ways to leverage local tax funds to support child and youth success.
