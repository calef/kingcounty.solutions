In October 2025, Neighborcare celebrated the opening of its renovated school-based health center at Mercer Middle School in Seattle, marking a significant milestone after two years of operating from temporary portables during the school's reconstruction. The Public Health School-Based Partnerships team was welcomed to the new facility, which aims to enhance health services for students. Neighborcare expressed gratitude to the Mercer Middle School staff for their support and acknowledged the beauty of the new clinic.
