Asian Counseling and Referral Service (ACRS) has appointed Kendee Yamaguchi as its new Chief Executive Officer, effective June 2, 2025, following a comprehensive national search. Yamaguchi brings over 20 years of executive leadership experience across various sectors, including federal, state, and local government. Most recently, she served as Deputy Assistant Secretary at the U.S. Department of Commerce. ACRS Board President Gloria Shin expressed gratitude for the leadership of outgoing CEO Michael Byun, who has been at the helm since 2018. Under his guidance, ACRS expanded its programs and strengthened its role as a resource for underserved communities amid the COVID-19 pandemic and the national racial justice movement. Yamaguchi has previously held significant roles, including Deputy Mayor of Seattle and Executive Director of the Washington State Commission on Asian Pacific American Affairs, where she advocated for policies benefiting underserved communities. In her new role, Yamaguchi aims to continue advancing ACRS's mission for equity and social justice while working collaboratively with staff, volunteers, and community members. The transition reflects ACRS's commitment to inclusive leadership and a progressive vision for the future.
