In a recent episode of Curiosity at Work, Dr. Julie Pham interviews Ed Ewing, Executive Director of Bike Works, a nonprofit in Seattle dedicated to empowering youth and fostering community through bicycles. With over three decades of leadership experience, Ewing emphasizes his commitment to social justice, racial equity, and cycling, which drives the mission of Bike Works. The organization operates as a nonprofit bike shop that sells refurbished bikes and reinvests all profits into community programs. Ewing’s leadership aims to enhance accessibility for underserved communities, particularly in Seattle’s South End, leveraging bicycles as a means of connection and transformation.
