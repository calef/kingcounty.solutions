Abdullah Haji Zada, a 19-year-old Afghan national and U.S. lawful permanent resident, has been sentenced to 15 years in federal prison for conspiring to commit a terrorist attack on Election Day 2024. Zada and his co-conspirator, Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, 28, received two AK-47-style rifles and 500 rounds of ammunition, intending to use them in a planned attack on behalf of ISIS, a designated terrorist organization. Zada, who was arrested in October 2024, pleaded guilty as an adult in April 2025, acknowledging his participation in the plot and agreeing to be removed to Afghanistan after serving his sentence. At sentencing, U.S. District Judge Scott L. Palk emphasized the severity of Zada's actions, which betrayed the opportunities offered by the U.S. Zada also waived his right to appeal the conviction. Tawhedi, who pleaded guilty in June 2025 to similar charges, faces a maximum penalty of 20 years for providing material support to ISIS and up to 15 years for firearms charges. Both individuals will be permanently barred from reentering the U.S. after their sentences. The FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force investigated the case, highlighting the importance of preventing acts of terrorism.
