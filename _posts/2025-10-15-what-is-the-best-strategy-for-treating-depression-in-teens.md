Supporting teen mental health is crucial, as 78% of teens report signs of moderate to severe depression. A comprehensive approach to treatment involves three key steps. 

First, maintain open communication with your teen. Regular check-ins help distinguish between normal teenage behavior and signs of depression, such as loss of interest in activities or feelings of hopelessness. 

Second, consider implementing a Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) program, which has proven effective for reducing severe depression symptoms in adolescents. DBT combines individual and group therapy, focusing on mindfulness, emotional regulation, and interpersonal skills. This therapeutic environment fosters peer interaction, allowing teens to practice coping strategies in a supportive setting.

Third, integrate DBT skills into daily life. Parents play a vital role by encouraging their teens to apply what they learn in therapy at home. Striking a balance between providing support and fostering independence enables teens to take ownership of their mental health while feeling secure in their family environment. 

This holistic approach, combining parental involvement with professional care, aims to help teens navigate their mental health challenges and build a fulfilling future.
