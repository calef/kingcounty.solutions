title: Bellevue engages community to refine communication methods, messages
topics: []

The City of Bellevue is engaging the community to enhance its communication methods and messages. Residents are invited to participate in a community listening session titled "Exploring Bellevue’s Identity Together," scheduled for September 25 from 6 to 7:30 p.m. at City Hall. This session aims to gather feedback on community perceptions, values, and communication preferences, which will influence future city communications and engagement strategies.

For those unable to attend the session, an online survey is available until October 5, with translated versions starting September 15. Feedback from this survey will be compiled into a report for the city council, including recommendations for actions based on community input. A related survey will be launched in late September to further assess community sentiment regarding engagement, accessibility, decision-making, and city values.

Community participation is essential for the city to understand residents' priorities and improve communication efforts. These initiatives align with two of the Council Priorities established by the Bellevue City Council in 2024.
