  Now that we’re past the solstice and it is officially summer, the King County Library System is gearing up with warmer-weather ways to celebrate, to enjoy and to learn–­indoors and outdoors.

  Our all-ages [Summer Reading Program](https://kcls.org/summer/) is in full swing, encouraging patrons to track their reading minutes. Reading to others and listening to audiobooks counts toward minutes read. All can be tracked through the [Beanstack app](https://kcls.beanstack.org/users/sign_in), or with a reading log obtained from your library. Check our website for details.

  For those who love to read outdoors (and who doesn’t?), KCLS is hosting a [Summer Reading in the Park](https://kcls.bibliocommons.com/events/6627f6503849bf4100b464c1) event from 5-7pm July 24 at Steel Lake Park in Federal Way. Bring a book, a picnic blanket or chair. Some refreshments will be provided while supplies last.

  Valley View and Shoreline Libraries are also hosting [Summer Meals](https://kcls.bibliocommons.com/v2/events?q=Summer%20Meals). Check our website and calendar for dates and times.

  Summer Reading challenges people to read, but it also invites people of all ages to participate in fun and educational programs, ranging from arts and crafts to science classes, book groups and author talks.

  Our [Makerspaces](https://kcls.bibliocommons.com/v2/events?q=Makerspace) offer a variety of hands-on activities and are popular draws. Labs and other sessions are scheduled at Federal Way Library, as well as the Bellevue Library, which recently reopened following the completion of a window replacement project.

  Study Zone is up and running again after a brief break in late June. Tutoring and homework help are available online and in-person.

  As for celebrations, many may not realize that public library access in some King County communities predates the formation of the Library System in 1942. Last year, Enumclaw celebrated its 100-year anniversary, and on July 13, Carnation Library will celebrate [its own centennial](https://kcls.bibliocommons.com/events/662dd0af8b48e73a00da63b4). Everyone is welcome to join in festivities that begin at 11am with crafts, followed by a science program with ice cream samples. A birthday ceremony that includes cake and an Eastside Fire Department firetruck tour will round out the day.

  Summer is also the time to visit local farmer’s markets, and KCLS’ Library2Go bookmobiles will be visiting sites to provide some services and convenient access to books and other materials. On July 6, the bookmobiles will visit Maple Valley and Issaquah Farmer’s Markets, and Fairwood Market Night in Renton July 10.

  Library2Go vehicles also will participate in parades, offering access to books. Parade events include Pacific Days July 13, as well as Tukwila’s Paint and Read in the Park event July 13. Bookmobiles will also attend the North Bend Block Party and the Vashon Strawberry Festival, both on July 20. See our website for the [Bookmobile’s summer schedule](https://kcls.org/news/bookmobile-schedule/).

  With all that is happening this summer, remember that KCLS libraries will be closed July 4 to honor our nation’s Independence Day holiday.

  Let’s hear it for summertime!
