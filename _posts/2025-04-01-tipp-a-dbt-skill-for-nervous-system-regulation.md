  <h2>Emotions aren’t just in your head</h2>
  <p>Have you ever wondered why emotions are also often called “feelings”? We use this term because we literally feel them in our bodies. Those butterflies in your stomach, a pounding heart, ice-cold hands and feet, blushing, getting overheated, feeling warm and fuzzy, a boost of energy, relaxation? All of these physical sensations can be ways emotions manifest in your body.</p>
  <p>What connects your mental experience of emotions with your body, creating physical experiences that accompany life experiences like grief, love, joy, anger, fear, and more?</p>
  <p>Your nervous system.</p>
  <h2>Emotional dysregulation and the nervous system</h2>
  <p>It’s normal to have physical responses to emotional experiences. These responses often lead to experiences that help you regulate after an emotional trigger sends you off-kilter. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-fainting-couch/202306/crying-it-out-the-complexities-of-mood-regulation#:~:text=One%20such%202014%20study%20posits,which%20controls%20involuntary%20bodily%20functions." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Crying is a great example</a>. Researchers have shown that crying helps your nervous system release some of the stored emotional energy, bringing you back in balance. How does crying help? It activates your parasympathetic nervous system, the part of your nervous system that helps you slow down, rest, and restore.</p>
  <p>That said, the physical experience of emotions can become overwhelming, especially if you struggle with dysregulated emotions. Having huge, long-lasting emotional responses can make coming back to a calm state an uphill battle, and <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8205175/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extended, intense emotional responses</a> are a common symptom of many mental health conditions. These dysregulated emotions can trigger your sympathetic nervous system, the part of your nervous system that pushes you to fight, flee, or freeze, generating huge physical responses that overwhelm you in the moment, making regulating your emotions even harder.</p>
  <h3>Regulation is possible, even in intense emotional experiences</h3>
  <p>You’re probably left wondering: does it have to be this way? Our answer is a resounding “<a href="https://thirahealth.com/2022/10/05/what-is-dbt-skills-training-and-how-can-it-help-you-overcome-anxiety-depression-and-other-mental-health-struggles/">No</a>!”</p>

  <h3>Temperature</h3>
  <p>The phrase “chill out” is surprisingly accurate. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38436059/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cooling down your body</a> triggers your parasympathetic nervous system. You can hold ice cubes in your hands (only 30 seconds at a time, to prevent skin damage), splash your face with very cold water, drink a glass of ice water, place an ice pack on the back of your neck (cover it with a dishcloth first to protect your skin), or take a cold shower.</p>
  <h3>Intense exercise</h3>
  <p><a href="https://dbt.tools/distress_tolerance/tip.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A quick 10-15 minute burst of activity</a> like a speedy walk or even a run, having a dance party, lifting weights, doing some jumping jacks or burpees, or any kind of movement you enjoy that increases your heart rate can help you shake off extra emotional energy.

Paced breathing for 1-2 minutes can activate your parasympathetic nervous system, helping your body lower your heart rate, reduce sweating, and cool you off from being flushed. <a href="https://dbtselfhelp.com/tipp-changing-your-body-chemistry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You can even</a> add visualization to paced breathing, imagining you’re breathing out the intense emotions to help you regulate them.</p>
  <p>Paced breathing can simply be breathing with a long inhale and an even longer exhale or counting during each breath to give yourself a steady breathing pace. Some examples include:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Box breathing: breathe in for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 4 seconds, breathe out for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 4 seconds.</li>
  <li><a href="https://dialecticalbehaviortherapy.com/distress-tolerance/tipp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Breathe</a> in through your nose for a count of four and out through your mouth for a count of eight.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Paired or progressive muscle relaxation</h3>
  <p>When your sympathetic nervous system is active, your muscles tense. Your brain wants you ready for anything, and the tension in your body shows it. Intentional muscle relaxation helps guide your nervous system back to a resting phase. There are two ways to try this exercise:</p>
  <ol>
  <li><a href="https://dbtselfhelp.com/tipp-changing-your-body-chemistry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inhale</a> and tense the muscles in your body. Feel that tension throughout, then relax all the muscles you can as you exhale. Try to do this a few times, and notice how you feel after several rounds of relaxing your muscles.</li>
  <li>Sit or lie quietly and tense your head/face muscles for one inhale. Relax them on the exhale. Move down to your shoulders, tense on the inhale, and relax on the exhale. Now, your arms, torso, upper legs, and lower legs. Tense on the inhale, relax on the exhale. What do you notice that’s different? Are you less overwhelmed by your emotions?</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>How can you remember to use TIPP in the moment?</h2>
  <p>Now that you know how to adjust your nervous system to help you manage your emotions, it’s time to put it to use in everyday life.</p>
  <p>It’s easy to remember distress tolerance skills like holding ice cubes or using breathing exercises when you’re feeling calm, but when you’re in the middle of an emotional upheaval, it can be harder to pause and use your skills to help you calm down.</p>
  <p>How do you keep TIPP handy for tough emotions and physical overwhelm?</p>
  <h3>Write it down where you’ll see it regularly</h3>
  <p>Write out your favorite DBT skills, like the TIPP skill, on sticky notes, and put them where you’ll see them regularly. Your bathroom mirror, car dashboard, or work desk are all great options. Choose places that will be obvious to you when you’re emotionally overwhelmed so you can quickly see the tools you need to withstand emotional distress.</p>
  <p>Leaving notes for yourself may feel a little weird at first; that’s normal! Sticky notes all around your house or your car with acronyms like TIPP and STOP, may feel silly, but they’re a powerful visual reminder of the skills you know will help you. They’re also proof you’re investing in your well-being by learning how to tolerate distress.</p>
  <h3>Create a distress tolerance skills toolkit</h3>
  <p>One common DBT approach to distress tolerance is to gather things that help you self-soothe together in one place so you have a toolkit on hand when you’re grappling with a distressing feeling or an emotional situation.</p>
  <p>Distress tolerance toolkits often include sensory items like lavender oil or minty gum, comforting objects like fidget toys or soft blankets, and headphones for soothing music. You can add DBT skill worksheets, information cards, or even just a list of distress tolerance skills in your toolkit to quickly remind you that you can get through this moment. It’s a reminder that you’ve got this, and you’ll make it through to calmer moments if you use what you learn in your <a href="https://www.thirahealth.com/how-dialectical-behavior-therapy-works-at-thira-health/">DBT</a> treatment program.</p>

  <p>This suggestion combines <a href="https://dbtselfhelp.com/dbt-skills-list/mindfulness/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the DBT skill of mindfulness</a> with distress tolerance skills like TIPP. If you practice introspection regularly, where you look inward and consider the thoughts and feelings of the moment, sitting with them without labeling them as “good” or “bad” but simply there, a part of you, it gets easier to use introspection to notice difficult emotions or strong feelings faster.

title: 'TIPP: A DBT Skill For Nervous System Regulation'
topics:
- Mental Health & Counseling
---

TIPP is a DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy) skill designed to help individuals regulate their nervous systems and manage intense emotions. Emotions manifest physically through sensations like a pounding heart or cold hands, which are linked to the nervous system's responses. Emotional dysregulation can lead to overwhelming experiences, often triggering the sympathetic nervous system, which prepares the body for fight or flight. TIPP provides four strategies to shift the nervous system back to a calmer state:

1. **Temperature** – Cooling the body, such as holding ice cubes or splashing cold water on the face, activates the parasympathetic nervous system.
2. **Intense Exercise** – Engaging in a 10- to 15-minute burst of physical activity can help release stored emotional energy and moderate heart rate.
3. **Paced Breathing** – Slowing breath can signal safety to the body, helping to lower heart rate and calm the mind. Techniques include box breathing and extended exhales.
4. **Paired Muscle Relaxation** – Tensing and relaxing muscles aids in transitioning from tension to relaxation.

To effectively use TIPP, individuals are encouraged to keep reminders visible, create a distress tolerance toolkit, and practice regular self-check-ins to enhance emotional awareness and response strategies.
