TIPP is a DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy) skill designed to help individuals regulate their nervous system and manage intense emotions. Emotions manifest physically through sensations like a pounding heart or cold hands, linked to the nervous system's responses. Emotional dysregulation can lead to overwhelming experiences, often triggering the sympathetic nervous system, which prepares the body for fight or flight. TIPP provides four strategies to shift the nervous system back to a calmer state: 

1. **Temperature** - Cooling the body, such as holding ice cubes or splashing cold water on the face, activates the parasympathetic nervous system.
2. **Intense Exercise** - Engaging in a 10-15 minute burst of physical activity can help release stored emotional energy and moderate heart rate.
3. **Paced Breathing** - Slowing breath can signal safety to the body, helping to lower heart rate and calm the mind. Techniques include box breathing and extended exhales.
4. **Paired Muscle Relaxation** - Tensing and relaxing muscles aids in transitioning from tension to relaxation.

To effectively use TIPP, individuals are encouraged to keep reminders visible, create a distress tolerance toolkit, and practice regular self-check-ins to enhance emotional awareness and response strategies.
