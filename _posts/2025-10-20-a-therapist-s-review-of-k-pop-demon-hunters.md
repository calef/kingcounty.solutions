  gets right about shame and facing our inner demons.</span></p>\n<h3><span>1. The
  source of shame</span><span>. </span></h3>\n<p><span>Truthfully, the psychological
  world is split about how they view shame. Some contend that shame is never a beneficial
  emotion seeing it as a negative view on the self without any remedy rather than
  a negative on a circumstance which can be addressed. Others note that shame can
  be an important element towards building honor, a sense of right and wrong, and
  societal mutuality, particularly in more collectivistic cultures. Regardless, at
  its worst, toxic shame can be a very oppressive experience. It can arise both due
  to a decision or action, or due to a sense of self. In the movie, we see both examples
  of shame: Jinu, the leader of the band The Saja Boys, who was turned into a demon
  because of a decision he made negatively affecting his family, and Rumi, the leader
  of the girl group HUNTR/X who was part demon by birth. Similarly, we see in our
  world that one can develop shame from actions, thoughts, or feelings, either as
  a single large event or a repetitive experience. Other times, shame develops due
  to a fear that a part or aspect of oneself is not acceptable; I’m not good enough,
  I always fail, nobody could tolerate this part of me. These thoughts can develop
  from explicit negative feedback or implicit messages, but in either case, the feeling
  becomes fully formed when the messages are internalized and becomes the way a person
  understands who they are. </span></p>\n<h3><span>2. Shame makes us hide</span><span>. </span></h3>\n<p><span>The
  natural first reaction of toxic shame is to hide. This is particularly prevalent
  in shame-based cultures where the idea of saving face can be strongly supported
  within social systems. In the movie, this idea is explicitly stated by Celine, Rumi’s
  surrogate mother, in her warning, “Our faults and fears must never be seen,” and
  visualized as Rumi continually wears long sleeves and covers her neck so that others
  cannot see the patterns that would reveal her demon heritage. Similarly, we don’t
  want others to see our inner demons because there is a fear that something bad will
  happen. In therapy, some people can point to a specific negative outcome—“I will
  be abandoned”, or “I will be judged”—while others describe it as existential terror
  that is impossible to define— “I will cease to exist.” Others may share parts of
  their shame but may omit certain parts of the story, highlight less offensive pieces,
  or slightly shift facts or even portions of the narrative entirely. An example of
  this is when Jisu is able to confess that his actions lead to the destitution of
  his family but is not able to share that it was due to his direct decision. Often,
  these changes manifest from an internal tension between wanting connection or emotional
  catharsis and fear of revealing the most wounded parts of the self.</span></p>\n<h3><span>3.
  Hiding shame quiets the demons&#8230; for a time and at a cost.</span></h3>\n<p><span>It
  is true that hiding something shameful can bring temporary relief. The more it is
  out of the light, the less it can be reacted to by others and eventually it may
  become out of sight, out of mind even for the person holding the shame. Things may
  feel normal, and life may feel like it is able to move forward. Unfortunately, this
  is only a temporary and partial peace. The cost of hiding is that there are always
  conditions to the quiet. One rule is that things which are reminders of shame cannot
  be brought up lest the negative voices be rekindled. As a result, the person continually
  holds a certain amount of anxiety and loses the choice of what they can and cannot
  engage with; like Rumi, they lose their voice. Another rule is that true relational
  intimacy is unachievable. Because certain parts of the self are restricted and concealed,
  one can only partially be in a relationship, never fully. These conditions eventually
  lead to feelings of being trapped, fatigue, and loneliness, and the perceived sense
  of peace becomes a heavy net. Furthermore, when the shame is inevitably triggered
  once again, the person is dragged back down, once again face to face with their
  old demons.  </span></p>\n<h3><span>4. Finding true freedom requires facing our
  shame and coming to accept truth.</span></h3>\n<p><span>At the climax of the movie,
  we find Rumi alone, her demon side exposed, HUNTR/X broken up, and the protection
  against demons destroyed. She returns to her surrogate mother, Celine, who continues
  to try and cover up the demon within Rumi. Tearfully, Rumi responds, “No more hiding.
  No more lies. Why can’t you look at me, love me, all of me?!” She then sings the
  following words:</span></p>\n<p><span>“I broke into a million pieces, and I can&#8217;t
  go back</span></p>\n<p><span> But now I&#8217;m seeing all the beauty in the broken
  glass</span></p>\n<p><span> The scars are part of me, darkness and harmony</span></p>\n<p><span>
  My voice without the lies, this is what it sounds like”</span></p>\n<p><span>The
  sentiment expressed in this song is the key to defeating shame, namely, being able
  to see the parts of ourselves that are broken or considered not good enough and
  accept that they are indeed a part of us. In psychological terms, this idea is called
  “radical acceptance.” The practice of radical acceptance is the act of being honest
  regarding what is real about ourselves or a situation without judgement. It does
  not mean that one likes what they see or that things can’t change, but rather, it
  is taking a position of being open to where things are now so that things can honestly
  be addressed and deep change can occur. When a person can find that acceptance,
  it frees them up because there is nothing to hide; they are able to express themselves
  fully and genuinely and experience closeness and intimacy with others. It also builds
  resiliency because they learn they can survive hard things and so know it’s okay
  to make mistakes in the future. When one can face their shame and accept the truth
  of reality it gives them back their voice and, perhaps, allows a person to truly
  show the soul within themselves.</span></p>\n\n\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</div></div></div></div></div></div><div

  ### Four Things _K-Pop Demon Hunters_ Gets Right about Shame and Facing our Inner Demons

  #### By Isaiah Lin, MA, PsyD

  &nbsp;

  The newest streaming craze of 2025 is Netflix’s KPop Demon Hunters. Premiering in late June, the show has now amassed 314 million views making it the most watched film in Netflix history and is being referred to by some as the Frozen of this generation. Praised for its cultural authenticity, vibrant art style, the movie is most greatly powered by its shoulder bopping and vocally expansive music. KPop Demon Hunters has had four songs listed in the top ten of Billboard’s Hot 100 list, including its most popular song, “Golden,” which up to the writing of this article has topped the chart for seven weeks straight. As a therapist, however, the element of the movie that caught my attention was how they addressed the idea of shame or our hidden “demons.” Spoiler alert if you continue reading, but let me highlight four things KPop Demon Hunters gets right about shame and facing our inner demons.

  ### 1. The source of shame.&nbsp;

  Truthfully, the psychological world is split about how they view shame. Some contend that shame is never a beneficial emotion seeing it as a negative view on the self without any remedy rather than a negative on a circumstance which can be addressed.

Netflix's K-Pop Demon Hunters, released in June 2025, has become a cultural phenomenon, attracting 314 million views and drawing comparisons to Frozen. The show is celebrated for its cultural authenticity, vibrant art style, and catchy music, with its hit song "Golden" topping the Billboard Hot 100 for seven consecutive weeks. A therapist reviews how the film addresses shame and confronting inner demons, highlighting four key insights.

Firstly, it explores the origins of shame, illustrating how it can stem from actions or inherent traits, as seen in characters Jinu and Rumi. Secondly, it shows how shame causes individuals to hide, a theme echoed by the surrogate mother Celine’s warning about visibility of faults. Thirdly, while hiding shame may provide temporary relief, it leads to anxiety and relational isolation, ultimately creating a sense of entrapment. Finally, true freedom comes from facing shame and embracing radical acceptance. In a pivotal scene, Rumi declares her desire for acceptance, emphasizing that acknowledging brokenness is essential for healing. This acceptance allows individuals to express themselves authentically and fosters deeper connections with others, illustrating a path toward resilience and emotional liberation.
