Netflix's K-Pop Demon Hunters, released in June 2025, has become a cultural phenomenon, attracting 314 million views and drawing comparisons to Frozen. The show is celebrated for its cultural authenticity, vibrant art style, and catchy music, with its hit song "Golden" topping the Billboard Hot 100 for seven consecutive weeks. A therapist reviews how the film addresses shame and confronting inner demons, highlighting four key insights.

Firstly, it explores the origins of shame, illustrating how it can stem from actions or inherent traits, as seen in characters Jinu and Rumi. Secondly, it shows how shame causes individuals to hide, a theme echoed by the surrogate mother Celine’s warning about visibility of faults. Thirdly, while hiding shame may provide temporary relief, it leads to anxiety and relational isolation, ultimately creating a sense of entrapment. Finally, true freedom comes from facing shame and embracing radical acceptance. In a pivotal scene, Rumi declares her desire for acceptance, emphasizing that acknowledging brokenness is essential for healing. This acceptance allows individuals to express themselves authentically and fosters deeper connections with others, illustrating a path toward resilience and emotional liberation.
