Essentials First has been advocating for improved access to hygiene and basic needs through the Essential Needs Coalition. This Washington State Legislative Session, the coalition supports two bills to enhance the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, HB 1463 and HB 1845. A hearing for HB 1463 is scheduled for February 11, 2025. TANF serves as a critical resource for families in need, providing cash assistance to help meet basic needs and protect children from deep poverty. 

In 2011, Washington eliminated broad hardship exemptions that allowed families to receive TANF assistance beyond the federal 60-month limit, creating significant barriers for many, particularly Black, Indigenous, and multiracial families. During the pandemic, the state temporarily restored these exemptions, which improved access and racial equity. However, the restoration expired in June 2023, leading to over 5,000 children losing benefits. 

HB 1463 aims to reinstate these broad hardship exemptions, helping families maintain access to essential support. Advocates are urged to show support by signing in to the hearing, submitting written testimony, or contacting legislators to emphasize the importance of the bill.
