Phase 2 of the Rainier Avenue S bus lane project in Seattle has been completed, extending the northbound bus lane to over 2 miles. This improvement aims to enhance the reliability of Route 7, which serves approximately 12,000 riders daily. The project includes upgraded sidewalks, ADA-accessible curb ramps, and improved street crossings for pedestrians, benefiting both transit users and the broader community. Together with King County Metro and local organizations, the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) collaborated closely with residents to develop the project.

The new bus lanes allow buses to bypass traffic, potentially saving riders up to 5 minutes during peak morning hours. Additional enhancements, such as new marked crosswalks and improved streetlights, further support safety and accessibility. These upgrades are part of a broader commitment to sustainable transportation options and are funded by the Seattle Transit Measure approved by voters. The project also prepares the area for future developments, including the forthcoming RapidRide R Line. Overall, this initiative is positioned to improve transit efficiency and contribute to the vibrancy of the Rainier Valley community.
