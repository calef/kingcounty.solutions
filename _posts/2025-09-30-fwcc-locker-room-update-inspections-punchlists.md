Work on the FWCC locker room renovation is progressing, having entered the punch list and inspection phase. Flooring installation is nearly finished, partitions have been set up, and sinks and mirrors are now in place. The sauna and steam room have been activated and are fully operational. While a few final tasks remain, the project is nearing completion. A specific reopening date has yet to be confirmed, but updates will be provided as more information becomes available. The team appreciates the community's patience during this improvement process.
