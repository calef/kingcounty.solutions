On July 23, Tacoma and Pierce County officials celebrated the grand opening of Kingfisher Tiny House Village at 1824 S. 84th St. This initiative, a collaboration between the Low Income Housing Institute, Pierce County, and the Encampment Resolution Program, provides 60 tiny houses for individuals experiencing homelessness, particularly those living in unsafe conditions along public rights-of-way. The event also honored Jeff Robinson, Tacoma’s former director of community and economic development, who passed away on June 12. Dignitaries praised Robinson's contributions to housing solutions and his dedication to serving the community. Tacoma Mayor Victoria Woodards emphasized the village's commitment to providing a safe, supportive environment for the unhoused. Pierce County Executive Ryan Mello highlighted the importance of collaboration among government entities to achieve such initiatives. The project aims to offer dignity and stability to residents, with support services to help them transition to permanent housing. Testimonials from former residents underscored the positive impact of tiny homes on self-respect and community integration. The grand opening marked a significant step forward in addressing homelessness in the region, reinforcing the collaborative spirit needed to tackle this pressing issue.
