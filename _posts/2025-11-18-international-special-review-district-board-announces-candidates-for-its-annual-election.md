The International Special Review District (ISRD) Board is inviting community members to participate in its annual board election, which is crucial for shaping the future of the Chinatown International District (CID). The election will be conducted via mail-in ballots, with a new deadline set for Dec. 2, 2025, due to an error in the initially mailed ballots. New ballots and pre-stamped envelopes will be sent to registered voters, who are encouraged to return them promptly. Special office hours will be held on Dec. 2 at Hing Hay Coworks for ballot submission and interpretation services.

Three board positions are up for election: Position No. 1 for a business owner, property owner, or employee; Position No. 2 for a resident, tenant, or community participant; and Position No. 4 for a resident, tenant, or community participant. Candidates include Hyan Ho for Position No. 1, Zhiyun Zhu for Position No. 2, and Kyle Jacobson and Xue Yi Liu for Position No. 4. The ISRD Board, established in 1973, aims to preserve and enhance the cultural and historical qualities of the CID. Current board members' terms will end on Nov. 30, 2025.
