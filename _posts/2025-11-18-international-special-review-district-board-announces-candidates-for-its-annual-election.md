The International Special Review District (ISRD) Board is inviting community members to participate in its annual board election, crucial for shaping the future of the Chinatown International District (CID). The election will be conducted via mail-in ballots, with a new deadline set for December 2, 2025, due to an error in the initially mailed ballots. New ballots and pre-stamped envelopes will be sent to registered voters, and voters are encouraged to return them promptly. Special office hours will be held on December 2 at Hing Hay Coworks for ballot submission and interpretation services.

Three board positions are up for election: Position #1 for a Business Owner, Property Owner, or Employee; Position #2 for a Resident, Tenant, or Community Participant; and Position #4 for a Resident, Tenant, or Community Participant. Candidates include Hyan Ho for Position #1, Zhiyun Zhu for Position #2, and Kyle Jacobson and Xue Yi Liu for Position #4. The ISRD Board, established in 1973, aims to preserve and enhance the cultural and historical qualities of the CID. Current board members' terms will end on November 30, 2025.
