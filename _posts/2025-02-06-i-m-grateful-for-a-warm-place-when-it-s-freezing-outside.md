During severe winter conditions, The Sophia Way, a shelter in King County, extends its capacity to accommodate more women experiencing homelessness. The shelter extends its operating hours and adds extra beds to provide a warm, safe space. The staff ensures that there is extra food, warm clothing, and medical assistance if needed. Despite the emotional stress the cold weather brings, the shelter staff uses a trauma-informed approach to create a calm, supportive environment. The shelter’s services, fueled by community support, offer more than physical warmth, providing compassion, stability, and dignity to those in need.
