  winter temperatures plummet in King County, it can be life-threatening for women
  experiencing homelessness. During severe cold snaps, like the one in January and
  this week, The Sophia Way increases its shelter capacity – **extending Day Center
  hours and adding extra beds – so that women seeking warmth have a safe place to
  be.**\n\nTo meet the increased need, our staff works tirelessly to create a warm,
  welcoming space for those with nowhere else to go. The Day Center, which typically
  operates from 8 am to 3 pm, remains open until 7 pm, and 10 additional beds are
  made available to help women shelter inside from the bitter cold outside. Extra
  food is stocked to accommodate the increased number of women, while blankets, sleeping
  bags, and warm clothing are distributed generously. If a woman needs medical assistance,
  staff ensure she receives the care she needs. _ **“We provide everything they need
  and create a safe space for them to sleep and stay warm,”** _ shares Katie Glore,
  Programs Manager II at The Sophia Way.\n\nThe freezing temperatures drive more women
  to seek shelter. _“Usually, we see about five women needing a bed, but this week,
  it was up to 15,”_ says Katie. With only 10 extra beds, she immediately started
  calling the list of shelters provided by King County. _“We were able to find space
  for four women and even arranged Ubers to get them there.”_\n\nWinter is not just
  physically harsh – it takes an emotional toll as well. _“The cold adds stress to
  everyone involved,”_ explains Naoual El Imani, Programs Manager I at The Sophia
  Way. _“For some women unaccustomed to shelter life, stepping into one can feel overwhelming.
  For those already staying at Sophia’s Place, the sudden increase in people disrupts
  their sense of routine and stability.”_\n\nOur staff understands these challenges
  and works to **create a calm, supportive space.** Using a trauma-informed approach,
  they prioritize safety, dignity, and respect_. “We ensure that women feel safe,
  treating them with kindness and understanding,”_ says Naoual.\n\nThe warmth women
  receive at The Sophia Way is more than physical; it is the warmth of compassion,
  stability, and dignity. “ **_I didn’t know where to go tonight. I was worried I
  had to sleep outside again. I don’t know if I would’ve made it,”_** shares one woman.
  Another expresses relief: **_“I came to Sophia’s Place last week. Staff was so kind
  to me and made me feel safe.”_** These expressions of gratitude remind us how critical
  it is to have a place of safety and warmth during the harshest days of winter.\n\nAs
  we prepare for more cold weather through the La Nina cycle, **we are deeply grateful
  to the community for making it possible to welcome more women during these critical
  times** – providing nourishing meals, warm winter clothing, and the compassionate
  care of our dedicated staff. It is this collective kindness that makes The Sophia
  Way a place of hope and healing, especially when it is needed most.\n\n> \n\nThe
