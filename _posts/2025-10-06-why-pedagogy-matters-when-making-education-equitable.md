title: Why Pedagogy Matters When Making Education Equitable
topics:
- Education & Learning
---

Boze Elementary students engage in project-based learning, emphasizing collaboration and individual exploration. Pedagogy, the practice of teaching, varies among educators and has traditionally emphasized compliance through rote memorization and standardized testing, particularly in schools serving students of color. This outdated system prioritizes correct answers over critical thinking and conformity over cultural identity. TAF aims to transform pedagogy by focusing on equity and liberation, moving away from mere test preparation to empowering students to effect change within their communities.

Through the STEMbyTAF model, education becomes a vehicle for students to address real-world issues, fostering agency and autonomy. Students actively participate in their learning, co-authoring rubrics and leading projects that resonate with their interests, such as tackling housing insecurity. This approach cultivates meaningful learning experiences rather than solely improving grades. TAF believes that students, particularly those of color, can shape their own educational journeys when provided with the necessary support and resources. The model serves as a blueprint for equitable education, aiming to create a system where every student feels centered in their learning, supported by a community committed to this vision.
