In project-based learning environments like TAF, students collaborate and engage in their own learning processes rather than merely complying with traditional educational models. The article critiques conventional public education, which often prioritizes rote memorization and standardized testing, particularly affecting students of color. This outdated system tends to value correct answers over critical thinking and cultural identity. TAF aims to redefine pedagogy as a means to promote equity, seeing education as a tool for liberation rather than assimilation. 

The STEMbyTAF model emphasizes real-world application and racial equity, encouraging students to tackle issues relevant to their communities. This approach fosters student agency, allowing them to become active participants in their learning—researchers, designers, and advocates. By co-authoring rubrics and leading discussions, students develop autonomy and a sense of purpose in their education. A notable example is a 7th grader who realized that school can be a force for good in addressing housing insecurity. TAF's vision is to empower all students, especially those of color, to shape their educational journeys and enact meaningful change, while fostering community partnerships to extend these opportunities to more learners.
