In honor of National Foster Care Month, Treehouse shares inspiring stories from Jeniece Driver, a dedicated education specialist who has worked extensively with youth in foster care. With a background in psychology and years of experience in child welfare, Jeniece highlights the resilience of two students she has supported.

The first student faced intense anger outbursts and homelessness, which led to multiple school changes. Despite these challenges, they graduated on time by switching to online schooling, becoming the first in their family to earn a high school diploma. They credited Jeniece's consistent support: “You always show up when you say you’re going to... You actually give a sh*t.”

The second student struggled with family addiction and became a caretaker for siblings. After a series of personal tragedies, including the loss of a grandparent and a career-ending injury, they persevered, enrolling in online school while working part-time. They graduated with honors, expressing disbelief at their achievement: “I never thought this was even an option for me.”

Jeniece reflects on her experiences, emphasizing the strength and determination of these students and the joy of witnessing their successes. Their journeys exemplify the impact of unwavering support in overcoming adversity.
