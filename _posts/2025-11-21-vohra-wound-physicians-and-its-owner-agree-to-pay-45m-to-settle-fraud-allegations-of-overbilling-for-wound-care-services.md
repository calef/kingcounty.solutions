Dr. Ameet Vohra and Vohra Wound Physicians Management LLC have agreed to pay $45 million to settle allegations of violating the False Claims Act by submitting fraudulent Medicare claims. The allegations include billing for unnecessary surgical procedures and services that were not covered under Medicare rules. Vohra, a major provider of wound care in nursing homes, was accused of a nationwide scheme to bill Medicare for surgical excisional debridement procedures that were either unnecessary or not performed. The U.S. Department of Justice claimed that Vohra pressured and incentivized physicians to maximize the number of debridement procedures billed, regardless of patient needs. Additionally, the company allegedly manipulated electronic health records to ensure higher reimbursements and created false documentation to support these claims. As part of the settlement, Vohra will enter a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement requiring compliance oversight and annual certifications of adherence to the agreement. This case highlights the government's commitment to combating healthcare fraud, emphasizing the need for accountability among providers who exploit federal healthcare programs for personal gain.
