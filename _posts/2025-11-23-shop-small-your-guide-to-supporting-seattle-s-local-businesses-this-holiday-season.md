Support Seattle's small businesses this holiday season by participating in Small Business Saturday on November 29. Established in 2010, this day encourages shoppers to visit local shops and restaurants, celebrating the unique contributions of small businesses to the community and economy. For every $100 spent at a local business, an estimated $48 is reinvested in the community, generating significant local wealth.

To support small businesses, shoppers can utilize the Small Business Administration's tool to find participating local establishments, explore the Intentionalist’s directory, and enjoy events like the 30th Annual Magic in the Market at Pike Place Market, which features holiday activities and a tree lighting ceremony. The C-ID Small Business Saturday Food Walk offers special discounts at participating local eateries, while the Meet the Maker Holiday Market showcases Asian American artists and makers. Additional events include pop-up shops from Seattle Restored and the Holiday Happening at Pacific Place.

From December 1-20, shoppers can join the Annual Ornament Scavenger Hunt for added fun, along with discounts available through the Visit Seattle Perks Pass. Seattle's Office of Economic Development continues to provide resources for small business growth and sustainability.
