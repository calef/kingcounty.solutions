What are three words that describe you?</strong><br />Authentic, approachable, and witty.</p>\n<p><strong>2. What is the “long story short” of how you landed at Inatai?</strong><br />I first came to Inatai with an IT contractor, providing onsite IT support two days a week. Over time, I got to know the people here, built relationships, and learned more about the foundation’s values and mission. When this role opened, I knew I wanted to be part of the team. What drew me most was the culture. Inatai isn’t just about “getting work done,” but also about creating a sense of belonging and community. This role also fit my career path, offering more responsibility and growth than a traditional help desk position.</p>\n<p><strong>3. What excites you most about being part of Team Inatai? </strong><br />What excites me most about being part of Team Inatai is contributing to the foundation’s mission while working in a fun, engaging culture. I value the chance to build relationships and connect with diverse communities across Washington. During my time here, I hope to make the IT department the best it can be for the team, building on what’s already strong and helping improve the overall experience for everyone who relies on our support.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Tell us about the community or communities you belong to.</strong><br />I’m part of the Gambian community in Seattle, where I connect with others through cultural events and gatherings. I’m also active in the Lynnwood Muslim community, including involvement with our local masjid’s parking management. Culturally, I identify as Mandinka, a tribe from Gambia, and I engage with Mandinka community members here in Washington as well. These communities keep me grounded, connected to my heritage, and supported through shared faith and culture.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Inatai’s strategies are underlined by a 50-Year Vision informed by communities. What is it about your community that keeps you hopeful for the future?</strong><br />What keeps me hopeful about my community is the deep sense of togetherness and support. People step in to help one another without hesitation, making it hard to struggle alone. That spirit of care and connection reflects the kind of future Inatai’s 50-Year Vision is working toward.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Finish this sentence: The Inatai value the most resonates with me is&#8230;</strong><br />Racial Justice.</p>\n<p><strong>7. What is your favorite fact about Washington?</strong><br />My favorite fact about Washington is its diversity of climate and landscapes. You can experience warm summers, rainy seasons, and snowy winters, all within one state. From lakes and rivers to rainforests, mountains, and Puget Sound, Washington truly offers a bit of everything.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Where is your favorite place in Washington?</strong><br />My favorite place in Washington is Alki Beach. I like the scenery of Seattle’s skyline, the ocean, and the long stretch of sand. It’s the perfect spot for scooter rides, bonfires, and taking in different views all along the strip.</p>\n<p><strong>9. What is the last thing you read, watched, or listened to that you would recommend? Why?</strong><br />The last thing I read was an article about how AI is transforming everyday IT tools. I’d recommend it because I’m excited about exploring how AI can make technology more efficient and user-friendly, both in my work and in daily life.</p>\n<p><strong>10. What do you like to do when you’re not at work?</strong><br />Outside of work, I enjoy going to the gym, hanging out with friends, and trying new foods. I also spend time watching shows on YouTube, playing video games, and shopping for clothes that match my style.</p></div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>"
