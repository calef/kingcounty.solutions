The Indian American Community Services (IACS) has launched a petition following the tragic death of 23-year-old Jaahnavi Kandula, demanding accountability and transparency from the Seattle Police Department (SPD). The IACS is seeking an independent investigation into Kandula's death and other civilian deaths involving SPD officers, disclosure of all details related to the fatal accident, release of all investigative reports from the Office of Police Accountability, and accountability for the three officers involved. The IACS is joined in its actions by numerous organizations, including the Asian Counseling Referral Service and the Asia Pacific Islander Coalition.
