Good news for Fresh Bucks customers in South Seattle: the Skyway Farmers Market is now accepting Fresh Bucks, providing a new option for shopping. Located in the Skyway community, this market supports BIPOC farmers and grassroots food justice initiatives. Established in response to food access challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, the market has evolved into a monthly event that fosters community spirit.

Starting May 25th and continuing through October, the market will be open on the 2nd and last Sunday of each month, from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the Skyway Resource Center parking lot. Shoppers will find a variety of fresh fruits, vegetables, and edible plant starts for home gardening. The acceptance of Fresh Bucks, along with SNAP/EBT, makes it an accessible and affordable shopping option for families. 

The Fresh Bucks and SNAP Market Match programs allow customers to maximize their food benefits while supporting local agriculture. The market dates for 2025 include May 25, June 8 and 29, July 13 and 27, August 10 and 31, September 14 and 28, and October 12 and 26.
