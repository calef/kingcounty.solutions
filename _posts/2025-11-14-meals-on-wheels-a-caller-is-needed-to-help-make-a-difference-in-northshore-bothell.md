Volunteers are needed for the Meals on Wheels program in Northshore/Bothell, specifically for the role of a caller. This position involves making weekly calls to homebound seniors to take their meal orders for delivery. Currently, the calling takes place on Monday mornings from 8:30 AM to 11 AM, but it will transition to Thursday mornings in the future. Volunteers will be a supportive voice for clients, ensuring they feel heard and valued, while also keeping their notes updated and connecting them to additional support services when necessary. Training is provided, and ongoing commitment is preferred from volunteers. Those interested in making a difference and contributing to the health and independence of seniors can contact the program for an application to get started.
