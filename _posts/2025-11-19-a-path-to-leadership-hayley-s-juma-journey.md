Hayley joined Juma while facing significant challenges as a young mother dealing with housing instability. Seeking stability for herself and her child, she was drawn to Juma’s YouthConnect Program. From the beginning, she felt supported by a team that trusted her, which allowed her to balance her responsibilities effectively. Her dedication quickly led to her promotion as Cart Lead, where she began mentoring other youths through their work experiences. Hayley developed her leadership skills, particularly when she coordinated her team during high-pressure events like the American League Championship Series at T-Mobile Park. Recently promoted to Assistant Enterprise Manager at Juma Seattle, she continues to thrive in her role, finding fulfillment in helping others grow. Hayley aims to further develop her leadership abilities while saving for school, embodying the values of empathy and support instilled by her mentors at Juma. Her journey exemplifies the organization’s mission to empower young people, demonstrating that trust and support can lead to personal growth and the ability to uplift others.
