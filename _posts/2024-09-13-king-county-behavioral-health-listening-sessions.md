  King County residents have two opportunities to share their input on the King County behavioral health system, including both mental health and substance use care.

  &nbsp;

  King County, and counties across the country, are facing behavioral health challenges including growing need for mental health and substance use care, a workforce shortage, and an overdose crisis, impacting residents all across the county, especially children and youth. The County is requesting to hear from a wide range of community voices to bring their experiences, concerns and desires into King County’s visioning and planning process for upcoming behavioral health system improvements.

  &nbsp;

  **1. Online survey**

  King County recently released a new online survey to learn how the behavioral health system can better serve communities. The survey takes about 10 minutes to complete and is available in 21 languages.

  **2. In-person Listening Sessions, starting September 23**

  King County is also hosting in-person listening sessions all across King County, including one event at each of the nine county council districts.

  Light snacks will be served and gift cards will be provided as compensation to those who attend. Spanish and ASL interpretation will be available.
