  Every fall, King County’s rivers come alive with one of nature’s most extraordinary spectacles: the salmon run. These iconic fish return from the ocean to the very streams where they were born, completing a journey that is as inspiring as it is essential to the health of our region. Salmon are more than just a Northwest treasure—they are a keystone species, central to the environment, our communities, and our shared future.

  This salmon season, the King County Flood Control District (KCFCD) invites you to celebrate the significance of salmon, learn more about the challenges they face, and experience firsthand the wonder of the salmon run at rivers throughout King County.

  ## **Why Salmon Recovery Matters**

  Salmon recovery is not just about fish. It’s about people, wildlife, and ecosystems. Salmon are an “indicator species,” meaning their health reflects the health of our entire environment. They provide food for orcas, bears, and eagles, and their nutrient-rich bodies sustain riverside forests, which in turn provide shade and clean water for future generations of salmon. Healthy salmon runs support local economies, cultural traditions, and the recreational opportunities that make the Pacific Northwest so special.

  Unfortunately, salmon populations across the region are in decline due to habitat loss, pollution, barriers to migration, and climate change. Their recovery is essential not just for the species itself, but for the resilience of our watersheds and communities.

  ## **Salmon and Indigenous Heritage**

  For Indigenous peoples of the Puget Sound region, salmon are far more than a food source. Salmon are deeply woven into cultural, spiritual, and economic traditions. They represent the cycles of life, teaching lessons about perseverance, reciprocity, and respect for the natural world. Many tribal communities continue to honor salmon through ceremonies, stewardship, and advocacy for healthy rivers. Protecting salmon is a way of honoring Indigenous heritage and preserving cultural traditions that have thrived in this region for thousands of years.

  ## **The KCFCD’s Role in Salmon Recovery**

  The KCFCD is proud to invest in projects that protect both people and salmon. By funding habitat restoration, the KCFCD is helping create healthier watersheds that reduce flood risks while supporting fish populations. Projects such as levee setbacks, side-channel reconnections, and floodplain restoration give rivers room to breathe, improve water quality, and restore vital spawning and rearing habitat for salmon.

  Every investment in habitat restoration is a win-win: protecting communities from flooding and ensuring that salmon have the conditions they need to thrive.

  ## **Witness the Salmon Run**

  One of the best ways to connect with salmon is to see them in action. Peak viewing months for watching salmon runs in King County are between July and November – so, we’re right in the middle of salmon season! Salmon viewing tips include:

  - Approach a river or stream slowly and stand quietly at the edge (do not enter the water). Do not walk in rivers or streams while salmon are spawning as you may accidentally damage salmon nests with eggs (redds).
  - Leave dead or dying salmon. Salmon carcasses provide valuable nutrients to the ecosystem and the future generation of salmon.&nbsp;
  - Maintain control of pets so they do not catch or scare salmon.

  Here in King County, you don’t have to travel far to see the salmon run for yourself. From the Cedar River to Bear Creek, there are many spots where you can safely watch salmon make their incredible journey. The [King County Salmon SEEson website](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/779f2239705a42fba71f198d958da479/page/Home) provides a map of viewing locations where you can witness this natural wonder before the run ends later this fall.

  ## **How You Can Help Salmon**

  Protecting salmon is a collective responsibility. Here are a few simple ways you can make a difference:

  - **Conserve water and electricity.** Reducing your use means less stress on rivers and the salmon that depend on them.
  - **Be an informed consumer.** Support businesses and practices that promote sustainable seafood and responsible water use.
  - **Plant native vegetation.** Trees and shrubs along rivers and streams help shade the water and keep it cool for salmon. Planting native vegetation in your yard, even if not along a river or stream, also helps other species, so it’s always a good idea to plant native vegetation!
  - **Dispose of waste properly.** Keep pollutants like motor oil, fertilizers, and plastics out of storm drains and waterways.
  - **Stay engaged.** Learn about salmon recovery projects and share what you know with your community.

  ## **A Season of Connection**

  Salmon are more than fish. They are a symbol of resilience, a cornerstone of Indigenous culture, and a vital part of King County’s identity. By supporting habitat restoration, protecting our watersheds, and making small but meaningful choices in our daily lives, we can ensure salmon continue to return to our rivers year after year.

The King County Flood Control District (KCFCD) is urging the community to celebrate and support the salmon season, a crucial event for the health of the region's environment and communities. Salmon, a keystone species, reflects the overall health of the environment, supports local economies, and is deeply intertwined with the culture and traditions of the Indigenous peoples of the region. However, salmon populations are declining due to habitat loss, pollution, migration barriers, and climate change. The KCFCD invests in habitat restoration and encourages community members to support salmon recovery through sustainable practices and active engagement in salmon recovery projects.
