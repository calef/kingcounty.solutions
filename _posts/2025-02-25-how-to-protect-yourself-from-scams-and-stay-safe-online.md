To enhance online safety and avoid scams, follow these essential tips. 

Create strong, unique passwords for your accounts using a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. Always keep your software up to date to benefit from security updates and bug fixes. Avoid sharing accounts with others to reduce security risks. 

When logging into websites, go directly to the site instead of using links from emails or texts, as these can be phishing attempts. 

Store your account logins securely using multiple methods. Consider keeping a physical copy of important logins in a secure place. Use secure notes or document apps like Apple Notes or Google Keep for digital storage. You might also create a Google Account to sync screenshots of your logins to Google Drive, making them accessible from any device. 

Lastly, provide a backup email address for account recovery, ensuring it is secure and accessible in case you forget your login details or lose access to your primary email. Implementing these strategies can significantly improve your online safety and protect against scams.
