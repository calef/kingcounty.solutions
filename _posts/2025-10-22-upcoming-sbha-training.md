A webinar titled "Preventing Substance Use and Exploitation in Adolescence" is scheduled for December 3, from 3:00 – 4:00 pm ET, hosted by Futures Without Violence and the School-Based Health Alliance. This session aims to equip health center providers and administrators with strategies to combat substance use, adolescent relationship abuse, and exploitation. Presenters will share clinical and community-based approaches to enhance prevention and response efforts, emphasizing the importance of universal education for all adolescent patients. Participants will learn to collaborate with youth, families, schools, and community organizations to create safer and healthier environments for adolescents.

Additionally, the Connected Communities Health Initiative (CCHI) will launch a webinar series on November 6, 2025, at 1 pm ET, focusing on addressing childhood chronic diseases. The first session will analyze insights from the HHS "Make Our Children Healthy Again" Assessment Report, discussing trends in nutrition, environmental hazards, mental health, and medication management affecting young health center patients. Featured panelists include Arielle Mather, MPH, and Dannielle Dobbins, M.Ed., with guest speaker Veda Johnson, MD, from Emory University School of Medicine.
