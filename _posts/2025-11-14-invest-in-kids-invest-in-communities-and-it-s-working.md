Seattle voters recently approved the renewal and expansion of the Family, Education, Preschool, and Promise (FEPP) Levy with a remarkable 77% support. This initiative will enhance access to high-quality, affordable early learning through the Seattle Preschool Program (SPP), providing preschool for 3,000 children from low-income families over the next seven years. The success of this initiative is attributed to strong community advocacy, with families and early educators playing pivotal roles in shaping public understanding of the importance of accessible child care and preschool.

The FEPP Levy not only increases preschool access but also supports child care providers through subsidies and staff retention payments. Testimonials from providers and parents highlight the positive impact of the SPP program on children's development and community engagement. Early learning provider Fabiola expressed how the program enables her to offer inclusive education, while parent Elisabeth shared her daughter's growth and happiness in the program.

Continued advocacy and community support are essential for maintaining these programs. Donations to organizations like BrightSpark help fund these efforts and ensure that all children have opportunities for early learning and growth.
