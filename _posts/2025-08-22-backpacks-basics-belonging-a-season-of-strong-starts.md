  <p>At Wellspring’s annual Back-to-School <a href="https://wellspringfs.org/family-resource-fair/">Family Resource Fair</a> on August 16, families walked away with backpacks, school supplies, and access to resources that go far beyond the classroom. Thanks to the generosity of donors, sponsors, and community partners, the fair was more than a place to pick up essentials. It was a space where families felt supported, connected, and ready for the year ahead. Parents saw that they weren’t alone in preparing their children for school, and children felt the excitement of beginning the year with the tools and encouragement they need to thrive.</p>

Starting strong in the new school year requires more than just supplies; it necessitates a supportive community. The Wellspring community exemplified this during its annual Back-to-School Family Resource Fair on Aug. 16, where families received backpacks and school supplies, fostering a sense of belonging. The event not only provided essentials but also connected families to resources and support, helping children enter the classroom with confidence and hope. Karly Lee, associate director of the Family Store and Volunteer Engagement, highlighted the importance of seeing a community rally around families during this time.

At Coronado Springs, a Bridge Housing property, the spirit of community continues through various programs and events. Residents celebrated Feria de las Flores, creating a vibrant mural that symbolizes cultural pride and belonging. Upcoming events include a Back-to-School Supplies Giveaway and a Tennis Together program, which aim to enrich children's lives and build confidence through play and learning. Cobie Sparks-Howard, director of Housing Services, emphasized that these initiatives show families they belong and are supported. Together, these efforts illustrate that community engagement can lead to a stronger, more connected environment for families and children as they embark on their educational journeys.
