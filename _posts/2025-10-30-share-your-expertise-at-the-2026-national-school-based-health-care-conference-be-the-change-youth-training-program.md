The National School-Based Health Alliance (SBHA) invites school-based health center (SBHC) providers, leaders, school partners, and youth advocates to contribute their expertise for the 2026 National School-Based Health Care Conference. This call seeks individuals whose work enhances student health access, collaboration, and health equity. Interested parties are encouraged to share their experiences related to expanding school-based health care, building partnerships, utilizing data for better outcomes, and creating innovative models for student well-being.

The SBHA is looking for expertise in clinical practice, business operations, policy, and innovation, including submissions in Spanish. Presenters can showcase their impact, inspire others, expand their networks, and gain national recognition. Reviewers can shape conference content, enhance their professional growth, and contribute to a diverse dialogue. The conference aims to unite health professionals, educators, state leaders, and youth to promote innovation and equity in student health. This is an opportunity to be part of a movement that transforms how schools support student health and well-being.
