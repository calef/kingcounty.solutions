Governor-elect Ferguson has hosted his first listening sessions focused on the Washington State ferry system. The sessions involved the Inlandboatman’s Union (IBU), Marine Engineers Benefits Association (MEBA), elected officials, business leaders, and commuters. Ferguson emphasized the importance of improving ferry service for island communities' access to healthcare, jobs, and education. His Transition Team is tasked with proposing reforms to increase ferry service reliability. Potential reforms include enhancing the Director of Ferries' role, expediting new vessel delivery, updating propulsion systems, and increasing staff training. The feedback from these sessions will help shape the proposed ferry system reforms. Ferguson will be sworn in on January 15, 2025.
