  Body\n\n**_Ferguson will prioritize improving system and service_  \nMUKILTEO –**
  &nbsp;Today, Governor-elect Ferguson held his first events focused on the Washington
  state ferry system. The events in Mukilteo and Clinton included meetings with Washington
  State Ferries staff, members of the Inlandboatman’s Union (IBU) and the Marine Engineers
  Benefits Association (MEBA), a tour of the vessel, and a listening session in Clinton
  with local elected officials, business leaders, and ferry commuters.\n\n“It is critical
  that we improve ferry service,” said Governor-elect Ferguson. “I heard again today
  how essential ferries to helping island communities access health care, jobs, and
  education. Washingtonians deserve service they can count on, and that is why addressing
  the ferry crisis is a priority for my administration.”\n\nFerguson has also directed
  his Transition Team to develop proposed reforms to improve the reliability and service
  of Washington State Ferries. The Transition Team, a 55-member group made up of stakeholders
  from across Washington State, includes a subcommittee with a focus on transportation
  infrastructure and the ferry system. The subcommittee will develop policy priorities
  for the first 100 days of Ferguson’s term, including key reforms to improve ferry
  reliability and service.\n\nFerguson shared the direction of some of those potential
  reforms during his listening sessions, which include:\n\n- Elevating the Director
  of Ferries within the Department of Transportation and Executive cabinet to improve
  accountability and direct communications;\n- Procurement reforms that could accelerate
  delivery of new vessels;\n- Research alternatives for updating the propulsion systems
  to minimize service disruptions;\n- Continue addressing to staff training and retention
  priorities to improve and restore services;\n- Create customer involvement programs
  that improve outreach, responsiveness, and feedback.\n\nThe input from workers,
  passengers, and local businesses will help shape Ferguson’s proposed ferry system
  reforms. Ferguson’s tour fulfills his pledge to meet with communities impacted by
  ferry service during his transition.\n\nThe event is the first in Governor-elect
  Ferguson’s planned outreach and engagement to ferry-impacted communities. He will
  visit San Juan County later in 2025.\n\nFerguson will be sworn in on January 15,
  2025."
