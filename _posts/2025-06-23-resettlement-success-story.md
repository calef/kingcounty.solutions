Niloofar, originally from Iran, resettled in Washington state with her family in 2023 after eight years of displacement. They initially fled to Kayseri, Turkey, in 2015, where they faced poor living conditions and community scrutiny while seeking refugee status from the UNHCR. Niloofar pursued her education at Erciyes University and Dokuz Eylul University, studying American culture and literature, while also supporting newly arrived refugees. After years of effort, her family obtained refugee status and was accepted into the U.S. resettlement program.

Upon arrival in Seattle, they were assisted by the Refugee Resettlement Office (RRO) with housing, Social Security, food, and job placement services. Niloofar enrolled in free ESL courses at Highline College and later completed her bachelor's degree in business administration. She secured a job at BECU as a concierge and was later promoted to member consultant II, where she helps other immigrants and refugees. Niloofar remains active in the refugee community, translating for Farsi-speaking clients and sharing her experiences. She emphasizes the importance of hope throughout her journey, which ultimately led her to fulfill her dream of visiting Hawaii.
