Seattle City Light has announced plans for a rate increase in 2026, aimed at addressing rising operational costs and investments in infrastructure. The proposed changes include a two-phase increase, with the first phase set to take effect in January 2026 and the second phase in January 2027. The increase is expected to average 3.5% for residential customers and will vary for commercial and industrial customers based on usage. City Light emphasizes the need for these adjustments to maintain reliable service and support sustainability initiatives.

In addition to the rate adjustments, City Light is focusing on enhancing its customer service and expanding programs that promote energy efficiency and renewable energy usage. The utility intends to engage with the community through public meetings and outreach efforts to gather feedback on the proposed rate changes. City Light aims to provide transparent information about the necessity of the rate increases and the benefits they will bring to the community, including improved service reliability and support for clean energy initiatives. Customer input will be considered as the utility finalizes its plans.
