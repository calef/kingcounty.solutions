Only 3% of Americans adhere to the four key habits for a healthy lifestyle: physical activity, diet, avoiding tobacco, and maintaining a healthy body weight. Recognizing that many people struggle with health due to busy lives and complex challenges, Valley's Lifestyle Medicine team has launched HealthyCare, a free 60-minute community session aimed at addressing these barriers. The session includes three impactful videos highlighting common obstacles like stress and time constraints, followed by a guided discussion among participants to reflect on these issues and their relevance to personal health. Additionally, attendees will be introduced to the services offered by Valley’s Lifestyle Medicine clinics, including Lifestyle365, physical therapy, and nutrition counseling. HealthyCare is positioned as an open dialogue about health, emphasizing understanding and actionable steps rather than a sales pitch. It invites those feeling frustrated with their health efforts to participate and fosters a shift from blame to empathy and from confusion to proactive change.
