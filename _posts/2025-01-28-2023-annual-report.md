In 2023, the Rainier Valley Food Bank (RVFB) served as a vital emergency food resource in Seattle's diverse community, operating for 197 days and distributing over 1.5 million pounds of food. The organization focused on providing a choice-driven service model while collaborating with partners to address food insecurity, which affects 1 in 10 people in Washington and more than 1 in 4 in Southeast King County. RVFB saw a nearly 20% increase in visits, totaling 98,428 instances of service for 6,746 households and 18,457 individuals.

Executive Director Gloria Hatcher-Mays highlighted efforts to secure grants for culturally relevant food amidst rising inflation. The SPARK To-Go Lunch program and grocery shopping services expanded significantly. The food bank's team grew, with salary increases to support living wage jobs. In addition to food distribution, RVFB enhanced its Community Connector services to connect individuals with housing and healthcare resources, reaching 350 people.

The organization thrived through community engagement, with 769 volunteers contributing over 21,000 hours of service. RVFB's funding for the year totaled over $6 million, supporting various programs and capital projects while laying the groundwork for future expansion.
