  #### Stay Steady, Stay Independent

  Falls are a leading cause of injury among older adults, yet most are preventable. As we enter the fall season, it is the perfect time to evaluate your risk of falling and take steps to strengthen your balance, improve your confidence, and maintain independence.

  #### Understanding Fall Risk

  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1 in 4 adults over age 65 experiences a fall each year. Risk factors include muscle weakness, poor balance, vision problems, medication side effects, and environmental hazards such as loose rugs or poor lighting.

  A physical therapist can assess your strength, balance, and gait to determine your personal risk and develop a plan to improve stability. Occupational therapists can help identify home safety risks and recommend modifications such as grab bars, adaptive seating, and improved lighting.

  #### Exercise and Prevention

  Exercise is one of the most effective ways to prevent falls. A combination of strength training, balance exercises, and flexibility routines can reduce fall risk and improve overall mobility.

  A well-known evidence-based program, the Otago Exercise Program, has been shown to reduce falls among high-risk populations through targeted balance and leg strengthening activities.

  Speech-language pathologists also play a role in fall prevention by addressing cognitive impairments or communication barriers that may affect a person’s ability to follow safety instructions or seek help after a fall.

  #### Community Resources

  Snoqualmie Valley Health is proud to participate in Falls Prevention Awareness Week by offering free educational materials and resources to the community.

  Join us at the Sno-Valley Senior Center in Carnation on Sept. 24 for free balance and hearing assessments, and learn more about how to stay steady, strong, and safe.

  If you or a loved one has experienced a fall, or you are concerned about fall risk, contact our rehabilitation team to schedule an evaluation. Staying upright starts with a strong foundation.
