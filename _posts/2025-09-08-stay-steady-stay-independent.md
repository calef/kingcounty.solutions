"Falls are a major cause of injury for older adults, but most can be prevented. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that 1 in 4 adults over 65 falls annually. Risk factors include muscle weakness, poor balance, vision problems, medication side effects, and environmental hazards. Physical and occupational therapists can assess personal risks and suggest improvements. Exercise, particularly strength training, balance exercises, and flexibility routines, can reduce fall risk. Snoqualmie Valley Health is offering free educational materials and resources for Falls Prevention Awareness Week, with free balance and hearing assessments at the Sno-Valley Senior Center on September 24."
