Monico Erich Gastelo, a 44-year-old from Fresno, California, was sentenced to 40 years in prison for sexual exploitation of a child and for receiving and distributing child pornography. Following his prison term, he will serve 15 years of supervised release with restricted access to children, computers, and the internet, and he must register as a sex offender for life. Gastelo created a fake social media profile pretending to be an 18-year-old to connect with minors, some as young as 12, demanding sexually explicit content from them. Between January and March 2020, he communicated with others interested in child exploitation, sharing and receiving numerous images and videos of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). A forensic examination of his devices uncovered over 1,500 CSAM files. His actions escalated in May 2020, when a minor victim reported being sexually exploited online by Gastelo, who had sent explicit images and pressured the minor to reciprocate. The case was investigated by various law enforcement agencies, including the Central California Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, and was part of the Department of Justice's Project Safe Childhood initiative aimed at combating child exploitation.
