The Bellevue City Council has voted to prepare an ordinance that mandates a minimum 30-day jail sentence for repeat offenders of third-degree theft crimes, including shoplifting. This applies to individuals with two or more prior theft convictions in Washington state within the last two years. Exceptions to this minimum sentence include participation in diversion programs, community court, and mental health or substance abuse treatment, as well as cases where there is a substantial risk of harm, allowing for electronic home monitoring instead. The council approved this measure with a 6-1 vote, and a check-in on the ordinance is planned after one year.

Additionally, the council received updates on the Conflict Resolution Center’s Housing Accord Program, which has successfully managed 454 landlord-tenant cases since 2023, aiming to reduce evictions and foster positive relationships. The council also reviewed an application from a resident seeking to reclassify a portion of their property as open space under the King County Public Benefit Rating System, which offers tax reductions for conservation efforts. Proclamations were issued for Domestic Violence Action Month, Filipino American History Month, and Disability Employment Awareness Month. The next council meeting is scheduled for October 7.
