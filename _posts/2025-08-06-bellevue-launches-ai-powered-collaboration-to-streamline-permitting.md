The City of Bellevue has partnered with Govstream.ai to pilot AI tools aimed at streamlining and accelerating the city's permitting processes. As Bellevue continues to grow, the initiative seeks to enhance efficiency and create a user-friendly experience for residents. The initial phase will support permitting staff, helping them access accurate information and navigate complexities more effectively. This partnership aligns with Bellevue’s goals of fostering a thriving community while maintaining high standards of livability.

City Manager Diane Carlson emphasized the initiative's potential to reduce permit application turnaround times and complexity, which has been a long-standing objective. The values-driven partnership prioritizes ethical AI use and includes safeguards to protect data and promote equitable outcomes. Govstream.ai, a startup focused on responsible AI deployment, aims to simplify the permitting process by converting city codes and records into clear, step-by-step guidance for staff and applicants.

Future phases will explore further streamlining of the application process and enhancing initial review times. Bellevue will assess the effectiveness of the AI tools after the pilot phases conclude to decide on their broader implementation. This collaboration reflects Bellevue's commitment to innovative technological solutions in city governance.
