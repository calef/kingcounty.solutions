  ## Bone-anchored prostheses improve gait, may reduce pain

  VA Eastern Colorado collaborated with University of Colorado Anschutz researchers to find bone-anchored limb implantations (BAL), also known as osseointegration, for above-the-knee amputations improves patients’ walking stride and potentially reduces long-term pain.

VA research highlights the challenges faced by veterans using prosthetic limbs, particularly concerning toxic materials and mental health. A recent study found that many prostheses contain harmful substances that can pose health risks over time. Additionally, veterans with limb loss often experience significant mental health issues, including depression and anxiety, which can be exacerbated by the physical limitations that accompany amputation.

Researchers are focused on developing safer prosthetic materials and improving mental health support for these veterans. Innovations in prosthetic design aim to enhance comfort and functionality while minimizing exposure to toxins. Mental health initiatives are also being prioritized to provide veterans with the necessary resources and support to cope with their conditions.

The VA continues to emphasize the importance of addressing both the physical and mental health aspects of veterans' care, recognizing that the well-being of those who have served is critical for their overall quality of life. Efforts are underway to integrate more comprehensive care models that encompass both physical rehabilitation and mental health services, ensuring a holistic approach to veteran care.
