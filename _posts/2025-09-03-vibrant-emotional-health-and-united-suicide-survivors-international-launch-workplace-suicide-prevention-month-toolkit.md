Vibrant Emotional Health and United Suicide Survivors International have collaborated to launch a toolkit aimed at workplace suicide prevention, coinciding with Suicide Prevention Month. This toolkit is designed to equip employers and employees with the necessary resources and strategies to foster mental health awareness and support within the workplace. It includes practical tools such as educational materials, guidelines for promoting mental well-being, and strategies for creating a supportive work environment. The initiative seeks to reduce the stigma surrounding mental health issues and encourage open conversations about suicide prevention. By addressing these critical issues, the toolkit aims to empower organizations to take proactive steps in safeguarding the mental health of their workforce and ultimately save lives.
