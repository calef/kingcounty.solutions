  <p><strong>NEW YORK, NY <b>–</b> (September 3, 2025) <b>–</b></strong> <a href="http://www.vibrant.org">Vibrant Emotional Health</a> (Vibrant), administrator of the <a href="http://www.988lifeline.org">988 Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline</a>, and the Workplace Suicide Prevention and Postvention Committee of <a href="https://www.unitesurvivors.com/">United Suicide Survivors International</a> have joined forces to launch a new Workplace Suicide Prevention Month Toolkit. This resource will help workplaces nationwide move from awareness to action during September—Suicide Prevention Month—and beyond.</p>
  <p>Timed with national observances like <a href="https://988lifeline.org/988-day/">988 Day (September 8)</a>, <a href="https://www.iasp.info/wspd/about/">World Suicide Prevention Day (September 10)</a>, and <a href="https://constructionsuicideprevention.com/">Construction Suicide Prevention Week (September 8–12)</a>, the toolkit provides a daily action calendar, sample communications, training resources, and strategies to integrate suicide prevention into workplace culture year-round.</p>
  <p>“Most people who die by suicide are of working age, and for many, the workplace is where they spend the majority of their waking hours,” said Wendy Martinez Farmer, Vice President of 988 Strategy, Quality Improvement and Clinical Standards at Vibrant Emotional Health. “By partnering with workplaces, we can normalize 988 as a trusted, accessible step for workers in distress—in addition to what traditional EAPs can provide—and ensure help is only a call, text, or chat away.”</p>
  <p>The partnership blends Vibrant’s crisis response expertise with the Committee’s mission to help workplaces become contributors, conveners, and conduits for suicide prevention.</p>
  <p>“Workers benefit when they have access to standardized high-quality behavioral health care, especially in times of crisis,” said Dr. Jodi Jacobson Frey, Co-Chair of the <a href="https://workplacesuicideprevention.com/">Workplace Suicide Prevention and Postvention Committee</a>. “988 provides workers increased crisis resources, reduced stigma and stronger support systems.”</p>
  <p>Dr. Sally Spencer-Thomas, Co-Chair of the Committee and President of United Suicide Survivors International, emphasized the broader goal: “September is our launchpad, but our vision is year-round culture change. This toolkit equips workplaces to identify risks, support those in crisis, respond compassionately to loss, and commit to ongoing mental health promotion.”</p>
  <p><strong>Join the Movement</strong><br />
  To sustain this momentum beyond September, we invite leaders, advocates, and people with lived experience to join the <a href="https://www.unitesurvivors.com/why-join">Lived Experience Collective Community</a>. This free, online network connects members to storytelling programs, workplace suicide prevention resources, peer support, and opportunities to shape national efforts. Together, we can transform workplaces into safer, more compassionate spaces where every voice is heard and every life matters.</p>
  <p>The <a href="https://workplacesuicideprevention.com/national-suicide-prevention-month-workplace-toolkit/">Workplace Suicide Prevention Month Toolkit</a> is available online, with customizable materials that can be adapted for any industry or organizational size. The daily calendar encourages leadership engagement, peer ally development, policy reviews, safe storytelling, and more, culminating in long-term commitments to mental health culture change.</p>
