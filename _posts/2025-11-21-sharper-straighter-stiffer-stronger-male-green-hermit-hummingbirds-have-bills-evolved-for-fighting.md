  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let’s get one thing out of the way: All hummingbirds fight. Most species fight for food, using their tiny bodies and sharp bills to force competitors away from flowers. But the green hermit hummingbird, which lives primarily in mountain forests of Central and South America, fights to win a mate.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They gather together at a place in the forest that looks just like a singles bar,” said </span><a href="https://www.biology.washington.edu/people/profile/alejandro-rico-guevara-0"><span style="font-weight: 400">Alejandro Rico-Guevara</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, an associate professor of biology at the University of Washington. “They all have perches, and if someone else takes their perch — their place in the singles bar — they go bananas, and they fight.”</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hummingbirds’ weapon of choice? Their own bills. Like medieval knights in a joust, the birds raise a long, needle-thin bill into the air before driving it into their opponent. The stakes are high: Hummingbirds also use their bills to eat, poking them deep into flowers to reach nutrient-rich nectar. Losing a fight means a hummingbird might not find a mate. Breaking a bill could mean they starve. </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">New research led by researchers at the </span><a href="https://www.burkemuseum.org/"><span style="font-weight: 400">UW Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, where Rico-Guevara is the curator of birds, found that these fights have shaped the species’ evolution, yielding significant differences in bill shape for male and female green hermits. Compared to their female counterparts, male green hermits’ bills are straighter, sharper and structurally stronger. The straighter bills work better as weapons, while female birds’ more curved bills provide improved access to nectar in some flowers. The findings suggest that green hermits’ bill sexual dimorphism — when two sexes of a species exhibit different characteristics — was likely driven by their tendency to fight, not solely by ecological factors.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Adult male green hermits have reinforced bills because they fight so much,” Rico-Guevara said. “It’s the same tool, but in very different contexts. This is an example of how much we can still learn from sexual dimorphism in nature.” </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the study, </span><a href="https://journals.biologists.com/jeb/article/228/21/jeb250769/369723"><span style="font-weight: 400">published Nov. 10 in the Journal of Experimental Biology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, researchers selected green hermit specimens from the Ornithology Collection at the Burke Museum and used </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry"><span style="font-weight: 400">photogrammetry</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to develop 3D models of male and female bills.

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the differences, researchers found, extend beyond bill shape. CT scans revealed that the male bill’s internal structure provided additional strength by transmitting forces more efficiently. </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, researchers ran the models through a series of simulated stabbings to stress-test the bills in both head-on and angled attacks.

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400">They also found that male bills’ straighter shape can accommodate a wider variety of attack angles, requiring less precision while fighting. </span></p>

Male green hermit hummingbirds have evolved distinct bill characteristics for combat, primarily to secure mates. Research by the University of Washington reveals that male bills are straighter, sharper, and structurally stronger than those of females, which have curved bills better suited for feeding. These adaptations are significant, as males engage in aggressive fights over perches in forested areas, akin to a "singles bar" scenario. The study indicates that the evolution of these sexually dimorphic traits was influenced more by the need for combat than ecological factors. 

Using 3D modeling and CT scans, researchers found that male bills are 3% straighter and 69% sharper, with a dagger-like tip absent in females. Male bills also show superior internal strength, allowing them to withstand greater stress during fights. Simulations demonstrated that male bills require 52.4% less energy during attacks and experience 39% less stress compared to female bills. This research highlights a unique example of sexual dimorphism in avian weaponry, contributing to our understanding of how competition shapes physical traits in birds.
