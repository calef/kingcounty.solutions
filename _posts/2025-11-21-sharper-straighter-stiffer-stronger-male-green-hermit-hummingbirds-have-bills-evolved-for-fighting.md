  bills evolved for fighting'

Male green hermit hummingbirds have evolved distinct bill characteristics for combat, primarily to secure mates. Research by the University of Washington reveals that male bills are straighter, sharper, and structurally stronger than those of females, which have curved bills better suited for feeding. These adaptations are significant, as males engage in aggressive fights over perches in forested areas, akin to a "singles bar" scenario. The study indicates that the evolution of these sexually dimorphic traits was influenced more by the need for combat than ecological factors. 

Using 3D modeling and CT scans, researchers found that male bills are 3% straighter and 69% sharper, with a dagger-like tip absent in females. Male bills also show superior internal strength, allowing them to withstand greater stress during fights. Simulations demonstrated that male bills require 52.4% less energy during attacks and experience 39% less stress compared to female bills. This research highlights a unique example of sexual dimorphism in avian weaponry, contributing to our understanding of how competition shapes physical traits in birds.
