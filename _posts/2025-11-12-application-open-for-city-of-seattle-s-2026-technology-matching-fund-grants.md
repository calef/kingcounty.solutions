The City of Seattle has opened applications for the 2026 Technology Matching Fund (TMF) grants, aimed at promoting digital equity and closing the digital divide. Non-profit organizations and community groups can apply for matching grants of up to $45,000 for projects that enhance digital literacy and access. The total funding available this year is $455,000. Applicants must provide a community match of 25% of the requested amount through volunteer time, staff hours, donated materials, or cash contributions.

Eligible projects include digital navigator services, digital literacy training, provision of devices and technical support, and expanding internet connectivity for low-income residents. The application deadline is January 13, 2026, with grant winners notified by the end of March 2026. The Seattle Department of Neighborhoods is partnering with Seattle IT to increase outreach and program visibility. Information sessions will be held to support applicants, and additional assistance is available for those facing barriers in the application process. This initiative continues the city’s long-standing commitment to ensuring equitable access to technology for all residents.
