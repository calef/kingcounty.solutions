The City of Seattle has opened applications for the 2026 Technology Matching Fund (TMF) grants, aimed at non-profit organizations and community groups focused on closing the digital divide and enhancing digital literacy. Grants of up to $45,000 are available, with a total of $455,000 allocated for this year. Applicants must meet a community match requirement, contributing 25% of the requested funding through volunteer time, staff hours, or cash contributions. Eligible projects include digital navigator services, digital literacy training, providing devices and technical support, and expanding internet access for low-income residents. The application deadline is January 13, 2026, with grant winners notified by the end of March 2026. Information sessions are scheduled to assist applicants with the process. This year, the Department of Neighborhoods is partnering with Seattle IT to broaden outreach and improve program visibility. The TMF was established to support efforts to bridge the digital divide, having awarded over $7 million since its inception. The initiative aims to empower communities by providing access to technology and digital skills necessary for participation in a technology-driven world.
