Help make a difference in Federal Way by joining the Meals on Wheels Volunteer team. This initiative aims to combat hunger among homebound seniors through the delivery of nutritious meals and personal support. Volunteers play a crucial role in ensuring meals reach those in need, with opportunities for individual contributions or to take on leadership as a Volunteer Site Coordinator. Coordinators oversee daily operations, organize delivery routes, and assist with various tasks to keep the program running smoothly. The position is based at the Meals on Wheels office in the Federal Way Community Center on Thursdays from 8–11 a.m., with some remote responsibilities. Long-term commitment and a passion for serving the elderly are essential. Ideal volunteers should possess strong communication skills, reliability, and a positive attitude. To volunteer, individuals must complete an application, pass a Washington State Patrol background check, be at least 21 years old, and have the ability to lift 15 pounds. A Washington state driver’s license and insurance are required for those interested in driving.
