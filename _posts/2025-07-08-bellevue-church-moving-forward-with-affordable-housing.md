St. Andrew’s Lutheran Church in Bellevue is moving forward with plans to co-develop an affordable housing project on its property located at 2650 148th Ave. S.E. The initiative is in collaboration with Imagine Housing, as reported by the Daily Journal of Commerce. This project aims to address the growing need for affordable housing in the area, reflecting a commitment to community support and development. The church's involvement highlights the potential for faith-based organizations to contribute to housing solutions. Further details on the project's progress and plans were noted in the DJC article, although access may require a subscription.
