Dr. Lisa Erlanger discusses GLP-1 agonists, medications increasingly used for weight loss, in a podcast with Julie Church, RDN, CD. The conversation covers the history, current applications, and side effects of these drugs, focusing on the implications for individuals with a history of eating disorders. Erlanger emphasizes that these medications are not transformative solutions, as the body still requires food and nourishment to function optimally. She critiques the marketing claims of these drugs being "miracle" treatments, asserting that safe and sustainable long-term weight loss is unachievable through medication alone. The discussion aims to inform listeners about the realities of weight loss medications while promoting a weight-inclusive perspective on health and nutrition.
