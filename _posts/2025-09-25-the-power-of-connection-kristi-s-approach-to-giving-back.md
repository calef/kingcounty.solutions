Kristi Hanna-Cruz embodies the spirit of giving back, shaped by her upbringing where generosity was paramount. She actively participates in Raise Your Vibe, an event for women entrepreneurs to connect and support charitable causes. At a recent gathering at Posh Beauty Bar, Kristi donated a portion of her proceeds to Mary’s Place, where Bhavani Kotha shared inspiring stories about the organization's mission to assist women and families in need. The event fostered engagement and connection among attendees. Kristi also organized a shopping trip, resulting in 17 bags of new clothes and essentials for families, enhancing their confidence and well-being. A memorable moment for Kristi occurred while delivering donations to a family shelter, where she connected with a young boy through a simple hand gesture, reminding her of the profound impact small acts of kindness can have. As the creator of Posh Beauty Bar and an online coach, Kristi is passionate about uplifting others. She emphasizes the power of community and believes that collective efforts can significantly improve lives, encouraging everyone to contribute to spreading kindness and support.
