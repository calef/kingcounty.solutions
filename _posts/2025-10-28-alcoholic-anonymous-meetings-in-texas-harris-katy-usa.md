Key local groups include the Katy 12 & 12 Group, which meets Mondays at 6:30 am at 5108 E 5th St, offering open meetings with a focus on meditation and the 12 Steps/12 Traditions.

AA's 12 Steps encourage members to acknowledge their struggles, seek a higher power, and make amends for past actions. Meetings are generally categorized as open or closed; open meetings welcome anyone, while closed meetings are for individuals committed to sobriety. New attendees are encouraged to arrive early, familiarize themselves with the group, and are often given a welcome keychain tag to celebrate their first step towards recovery.
