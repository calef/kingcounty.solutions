  <h2>The 12 Steps of AA</h2>
  <ol>
  <li><strong>We admitted we were powerless over alcohol—that our lives had become unmanageable.</strong> The first step is about recognizing the impact of alcohol and accepting the need for help in order to begin recovery.</li>
  <li><strong>Came to believe that a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.</strong> Members are encouraged to find hope in something beyond themselves, whether spiritual, communal, or personal.</li>
  <li><strong>Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of God as we understood Him.</strong> This step involves developing trust in a higher power and letting go of self-will as a path to healing.</li>
  <li><strong>Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.</strong> This introspective process helps members honestly assess their behaviors, thoughts, and relationships.</li>
  <li><strong>Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.</strong> Confession and honesty are key components in shedding the guilt and isolation of addiction.</li>
  <li><strong>Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of character.</strong> The focus shifts to willingness to change and grow beyond past mistakes.</li>
  <li><strong>Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.</strong> Members seek help—either from a higher power, group, or sponsor—to overcome personal flaws.</li>
  <li><strong>Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.</strong> This step prepares members for taking responsibility for their actions and repairing relationships.</li>
  <li><strong>Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.</strong> Actual reconciliation is attempted, provided it does no harm.</li>
  <li><strong>Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.</strong> Ongoing self-reflection and accountability help maintain sobriety and personal growth.</li>
  <li><strong>Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.</strong> Spiritual practice becomes a regular part of recovery.</li>
  <li><strong>Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.</strong> Members are encouraged to share their experience and support others in recovery.</li>
