Federal funding challenges are prompting YouthCare to make significant changes to ensure the sustainability of its services for youth in crisis in King County. The organization will close two programs: Casa de los Amigos, a shelter for undocumented immigrant youth, due to reduced referrals and funding uncertainty, and YouthGrow, a stay-in-school initiative, reallocating its resources to a new workforce initiative. Two additional programs will evolve, focusing on GED access and computer technology training.

YouthCare is preserving three critical programs: the Adolescent Shelter for homeless youth, the ISIS Program for LGBTQ+ youth, and the Phoenix Program for Unaccompanied Refugee Minors. These decisions reflect a commitment to maintaining essential services amidst a challenging funding landscape marked by decreased federal support and rising costs. 

YouthCare reaffirms its core mission through programs like Young Adult Transitional Living and emergency shelters, while also addressing the impact of these changes on staff, providing support and opportunities for affected employees. Looking ahead, YouthCare is focused on a future of stability and growth, highlighted by the upcoming Constellation Center, which aims to integrate various support services for youth in one location. Community support is vital as YouthCare continues to stand by the young people it serves.
