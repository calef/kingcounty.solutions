original_content: "![](https://sophiaway.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Image-BHM-2025-02.png)\n\nAs we commemorate Black History Month, **The Sophia Way recognizes the deep-rooted systemic barriers that have disproportionately impacted Black individuals in experiencing homelessness**. According to the 2024 Point-in-Time Count, 19% of individuals experiencing homelessness in King County identify as Black or African American, despite making up only 6% of the county’s general population, as reported in the 2020 U.S. Census.\n\nA history of discriminatory housing practices, such as redlining, along with socioeconomic disparities and the lasting impact of incarceration, continue to create significant barriers to stable housing. **Homelessness and the increasing lack of affordable housing are not just housing issues, but a racial justice issue.**\n\nAt The Sophia Way, we see these disparities firsthand. **Nearly 54% of the women we serve are women of color** , many of whom face challenging barriers to securing stable housing – systemic inequities, income disparities, and a severe shortage of affordable housing options. These challenges are the lived realities of the women walking through our doors every day.\n\nAdditionally, a significant percentage of The Sophia Way’s staff are women of color, many of whom have experienced similar challenges as the women they serve. Their lived experiences not only inform their work but also reinforce our commitment to advocating housing for all.\n\nThe Sophia Way’s mission is to be a place of hope and change for women experiencing homelessness. We advocate for systemic changes that will make it possible for all women to have a place to call home. This Black History Month, **we invite you to take action** – advocate for housing equity and support policies that expand affordable housing – to ensure that everyone, regardless of race or economics, has access to housing.\n\nThis February, we also invite you to **make a difference by supporting women with hair care products for Black and textured hair.** These hair care products are often expensive and hard to find, yet they are essential for proper hair health and dignity for the women we serve. We’re hosting a donation drive throughout the month to ensure everyone can access the products they need. You can find our requested items and a list of local black-owned small businesses on our **[webpage here](https://sophiaway.org/bhm-drive/).&nbsp;**\n\n> \n\nThe post [Honoring Black History Month: A Call for Housing Equity](https://sophiaway.org/bhm-2025/) first appeared on [The Sophia Way](https://sophiaway.org)."
