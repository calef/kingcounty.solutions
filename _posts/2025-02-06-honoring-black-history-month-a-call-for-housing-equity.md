The Sophia Way, a homelessness organization, recognizes systemic barriers that disproportionately impact Black individuals experiencing homelessness. Despite only making up 6% of King County's population, 19% of its homeless population identifies as Black or African American. The Sophia Way identifies discriminatory housing practices, socioeconomic disparities, and the effects of incarceration as major barriers to securing stable housing. Nearly 54% of the women served by The Sophia Way are women of color, facing similar challenges. The organization is advocating for systemic changes and affordable housing policies. They are also hosting a donation drive for hair care products for Black and textured hair.
