Douglas Wayne Cornett from Spotsylvania County, Virginia, was sentenced to life in prison after pleading guilty to two federal hate crime charges involving attempts to kill and discharging a firearm during a violent crime. On February 28, 2024, Cornett followed a box truck driven by a Latino male, referred to as O.G., to a gas station. After questioning O.G.'s status in the U.S. and learning he had been here for only two years, Cornett opened fire, hitting O.G. three times and a friend, J.M., once. Cornett admitted to the shooting, motivated by his perception of their national origin. The case was investigated by the FBI's Richmond Field Office and prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia. Officials emphasized the importance of holding accountable those who perpetrate hate-fueled violence.
