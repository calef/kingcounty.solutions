The College Ganas Program aims to empower Latino youth in their pursuit of higher education by fostering the cultural concept of "GANAS," which signifies the desire to succeed and achieve dreams. The program provides various forms of support, including workshops focused on college readiness and career planning, field trips to colleges, and assistance with scholarship applications and financial aid. Individual mentorship is emphasized to help students visualize their future on campus. The program also offers workshops for caregivers, recognizing the barriers faced by many families that may hinder participation in larger events. Eligibility is open to high school students in Seattle Public Schools or Auburn School District. The program is free for all youth and families, encouraging early planning for college, typically starting in the senior year. Financial support options include FAFSA/WASFA, scholarships, grants, and work-study opportunities. Contact information for program managers is provided for those in Seattle and Auburn to facilitate engagement.
