Join the Meals on Wheels team in Federal Way as an Alternate Delivery Driver. This volunteer opportunity helps homebound seniors maintain their health and independence by providing nutritious meals and personal contact. Volunteers are needed on Thursday mornings to deliver meals, with pickup occurring between 8 and 9 am. The delivery routes typically take 1-2 hours to complete. Training is provided, and mileage incurred during deliveries is reimbursable. This role is suitable for individuals and is kid-friendly. Interested volunteers can obtain an application by contacting the program directly.
