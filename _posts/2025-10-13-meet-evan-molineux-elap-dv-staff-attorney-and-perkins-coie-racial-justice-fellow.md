  In 2021 Perkins Coie launched a Racial Justice Fellowship to provide an opportunity for first- and second-year associates to spend six months doing full time pro bono legal work at a community-based organization. As part of that prestigious program, Evan Molineux has joined the ELAP team, and we are excited to have him on board as a Domestic Violence Staff Attorney for the next half year.

  We chatted with him about the fellowship, what he’s looking forward to in this role, and his commitment to domestic violence work.

  **Why did you decide to participate as a fellow?**

  One of the reasons Perkins Coie appealed to me as a law firm is because of this fellowship. Every law firm has a pro bono practice, but not all of them are necessarily fully living up to it. When I was interviewing at firms after graduating from law school, I found that Perkins Coie was one of the rare exceptions. People in the firm are actively involved in pro bono volunteering. And the opportunity to do six months of pro bono work is an incredible thing. It really speaks to the values of the firm and its mission to promote racial equity through direct service and community engagement.

  **Tell us about your interest in domestic violence work.**

  I went to Georgetown for law school, which has a domestic violence legal clinic. I was involved in that clinic, helping women in the DC area receive protection orders. I also volunteered at shelters and legal aid organizations that supported victims of domestic violence. It’s a personal issue for me—it’s something I always want to be involved with in some capacity in my career.

  **What do you hope to contribute and learn at ELAP?**

  So much of the work they are doing is supporting victims, and that’s a big thing for me. I want to continue to learn the best and most effective ways to help victims of domestic violence. It’s going to give me a lot of exposure and experience. It’s a great opportunity to learn from people who have been doing the work for longer than me. I’d also love to learn about other family law issues and be another hand that can do that work. I already have found the ELAP staff team to be very helpful, kind, and supportive.

  **Why do you do this work?**

  Domestic violence legal work is not just a professional interest, it is a lifelong commitment. Domestic violence is personal to me because I recognize the profound social and interpersonal complexities at its core. I’m grateful that I grew up in a mixed-race household surrounded by strong, loving women. I understand that domestic violence is not a simple issue of harm and relief. It is shaped by cultural, racial, socioeconomic, and interpersonal dynamics. Effective advocacy requires listening to clients and understanding their unique circumstances. I always try to be a calm and respectful presence and focus on understanding a client’s background.&nbsp;

  I’ve had some great mentors since I started this work at Georgetown, Perkins Coie, and now at ELAP. That’s been a major benefit for me in terms of learning and staying motivated even when the work is heavy. I’m grateful to everyone who’ve helped me grow and realize the value in this work.

  My goal is to help build a community where respect prevails and all individuals—victims, children, and respondents—can live free from harm. I am motivated to do this work because I believe that everyone has a responsibility to support survivors and work toward a future without domestic violence.

  **Do you have any secret skills?**

  I play the bass in a band, and I run ultramarathons.
