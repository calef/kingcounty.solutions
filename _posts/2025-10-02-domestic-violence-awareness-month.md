October is recognized as Domestic Violence Awareness Month, a time to raise awareness about the impact of domestic violence and support those affected. The campaign aims to educate communities about the signs of abuse and encourage individuals to take action against it. Domestic violence remains a significant issue, affecting millions across the country. It encompasses various forms of abuse, including physical, emotional, and financial abuse. 

Lighthouse Northwest emphasizes the importance of community involvement in combating domestic violence. Resources and support systems are available for victims, including hotlines and shelters, which can provide immediate assistance and safety. The organization encourages individuals to educate themselves, share information, and engage in discussions to promote awareness. 

Throughout October, various events and activities will be held to highlight the severity of domestic violence and to honor survivors. Advocacy and support initiatives are essential to break the cycle of violence and create a safer environment for everyone. Lighthouse Northwest invites the community to unite in this effort, fostering a culture that prioritizes safety and respect.
