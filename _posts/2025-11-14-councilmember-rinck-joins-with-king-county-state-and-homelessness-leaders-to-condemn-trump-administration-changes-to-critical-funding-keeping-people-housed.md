Councilmember Rinck and local leaders condemned recent changes to HUD’s Continuum of Care program, which threaten to impact nearly 4,500 households in Seattle and King County. The Trump administration's new funding guidelines limit the use of funds for permanent housing, potentially increasing homelessness for 170,000 people nationwide. Local officials are convening to develop contingency plans, as existing grants will expire before the new funding cycle concludes. Rinck proposed an amendment to allocate $11.8 million to sustain current housing programs, emphasizing the need for regional collaboration to protect vulnerable communities.
