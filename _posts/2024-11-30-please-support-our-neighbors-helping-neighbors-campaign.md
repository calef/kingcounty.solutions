Issaquah Community Services is launching its annual "Neighbors Helping Neighbors" fundraising campaign with a goal of raising $120,000, accounting for over one-third of its annual assistance budget. The organization heavily depends on community support to aid residents facing temporary financial crises. Every donation will directly benefit individuals living within the Issaquah School District. Each year, Issaquah Community Services assists over 400 households in paying rent and preventing eviction during financial emergencies. The recent "bomb cyclone" has exacerbated challenges for many local families, leading to lost wages and increased hardships as they approach the holiday season. The community is encouraged to read the autumn newsletter to learn about past assistance provided and to visit the donation page to contribute or discover other ways to support the mission. The organization expresses gratitude to its donors for their continued involvement and support.
