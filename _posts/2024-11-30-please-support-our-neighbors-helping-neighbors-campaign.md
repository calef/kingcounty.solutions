  #### **Make a Difference in Someone’s Life.**

  It’s time again for our annual fundraiser. Our goal for this year’s campaign is $120,000, a little more than one third of our annual assistance budget. We rely heavily on the support of our community to continue helping neighbors who experience a temporary financial crisis.

  100% of your donation will go to help residents living within the Issaquah School District boundaries.

  Each year, Issaquah Community Services helps over 400 local households pay rent and avoid eviction when they experience a financial emergency. The recent “bomb cyclone” left more than downed trees and debris in its aftermath. For many of our less fortunate neighbors, the resulting loss of wages means new hardships as they enter the holiday season.

  Read our autumn newsletter to learn about who and how we helped our neighbors with the money we raised last year.

  Visit our Donate page to donate now or learn about the many ways you can support our important mission.

  Thank you, donors, for being a part of the ICS team. We couldn’t do this without you.

Issaquah Community Services is launching its annual "Neighbors Helping Neighbors" fundraising campaign with a goal of raising $120,000, accounting for over one-third of its annual assistance budget. The organization heavily depends on community support to aid residents facing temporary financial crises. Every donation will directly benefit individuals living within the Issaquah School District. Each year, Issaquah Community Services assists over 400 households in paying rent and preventing eviction during financial emergencies. The recent "bomb cyclone" has exacerbated challenges for many local families, leading to lost wages and increased hardships as they approach the holiday season. The community is encouraged to read the autumn newsletter to learn about past assistance provided and to visit the donation page to contribute or discover other ways to support the mission. The organization expresses gratitude to its donors for their continued involvement and support.
