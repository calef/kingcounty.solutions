John will be out of the office on August 22nd and 25th, resulting in no tech help or tech 101 class on those days. Elevator issues are ongoing, attributed to users holding doors open, and assistance is requested to prevent this. The programming for August includes Roundtable Conversations led by social worker Syl on the 13th and 27th at 1:30 PM, focusing on topics like “Advice that you would give your 18-year-old self” and “What issues do you hope to see resolved in your lifetime.” John will conduct four tech 101 classes this month: Internet Basics on August 1st, Internet Safety on August 8th, and a special presentation on Artificial Intelligence for Seniors on August 13th instead of the usual Friday class. There will be no tech class on August 15th, and he will offer Internet Tips and Tricks on August 29th. Everyone is encouraged to participate in these programs for engagement and community building.
