---

The Snoqualmie Tribe has announced a 30-day comment period for the General Welfare Posthumous Internment and Headstone Benefit Policy. This draft policy was developed by the Tribal Council and the General Resources Department. Tribal members can request a copy of the draft policy by emailing RSVP@snoqualmietribe.us. The policy is not for public use and should not be shared on social media. 

Feedback from tribal members is encouraged to improve the draft's content and structure, ensuring it better supports program implementation. Comments must be submitted via email and should include the submitter's name and enrollment ID to verify they are an adult enrolled member. The comment period will close on December 26, 2025. A physical memo will also be mailed to all Tribal Members in early December.
