Join the Meals on Wheels team in Tukwila as a delivery driver and make a difference in the lives of homebound seniors. Volunteers are needed on Thursday mornings to deliver nutritious meals and provide personal contact to help seniors maintain their health and independence. Drivers typically pick up meals around 9 am and complete their routes within 1-2 hours. Training is offered, and mileage is reimbursed during deliveries. This opportunity is suitable for individuals and is kid-friendly. For those interested in volunteering, contact Meals on Wheels for an application to get started.
