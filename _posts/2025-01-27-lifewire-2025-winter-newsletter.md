LifeWire's 2025 Winter Newsletter highlights the impact of community support on survivors of domestic violence. The story of Erica, who relocated with her two daughters to escape an abusive relationship, emphasizes the crucial assistance provided by LifeWire, including help with housing and essential documentation. The newsletter also celebrates the success of the 1980s-themed World of Hope Gala, which raised over $312,000 to support families affected by domestic violence. The event featured nostalgic entertainment and generous contributions from attendees. 

Additionally, LifeWire's Holiday Shop brought joy to 111 parents and 245 children, providing gifts and gift cards to families in need. Community partners helped create a memorable holiday experience for participants. LifeWire has also introduced a new pet-friendly shelter, addressing the needs of survivors who may hesitate to leave due to concerns for their pets. The organization received a RedRover Safe Housing grant to support this initiative, ensuring that survivors can find safety without leaving their pets behind. Janeira Bencosme-Gil has been appointed Interim Executive Director, bringing her extensive experience to guide LifeWire's future efforts.
