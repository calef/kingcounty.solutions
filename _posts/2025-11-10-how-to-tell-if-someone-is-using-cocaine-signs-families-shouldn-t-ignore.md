Recognizing the signs of cocaine use is crucial for families concerned about a loved one’s health. Key indicators include noticeable changes in behavior, such as increased energy, restlessness, or hyperactivity. Users may also exhibit mood swings, irritability, or paranoia. Physical signs can include dilated pupils, frequent nosebleeds, or changes in appetite and sleep patterns. Additionally, individuals may engage in secretive behavior, neglect responsibilities, or experience financial issues due to spending on the drug. Families should pay attention to these signs and consider seeking professional help if they suspect cocaine use. Early intervention can make a significant difference in addressing addiction and supporting recovery.
