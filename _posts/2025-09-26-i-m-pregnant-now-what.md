  <p>Pregnancy wasn’t in your plans. Now you’re left with lots of questions. What do I do now? How will this work? How do I tell my parents? How do I finish school? How do I even know who the father is?&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Don’t be ashamed of any of your questions. Let&#8217;s explore some of the most common questions you might have when finding out you are unexpectedly pregnant.&nbsp;</p>



  <div style="height:8px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



  <h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>I just found out I’m unexpectedly pregnant. What do I do now?</strong></h1>



  <div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



  <h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>I’m pregnant. How far along am I?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



  <div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



  <p>There are several ways to figure out when you conceived. In general, women can only conceive during ovulation which happens around day 14 of the average 28 day menstrual cycle.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>You can learn more about how to track when you ovulated in this article:<a href="https://carenetps.org/when-did-i-get-pregnant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title=""> When Did I Get Pregnant?</a> This will give you a loose idea of when you became pregnant.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>The most accurate way to figure out how far along you are is with an<a href="https://carenetps.org/free-viability-ultrasound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title=""> ultrasound.</a> Care Net of Puget Sound offers free viability ultrasounds to confirm gestational age and pregnancy viability.&nbsp;</p>



  <h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>I’m pregnant. But I’m not sure who the father is.</strong></h2>



  <div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



  <p>Not knowing who the father is can make feelings even heavier. If you have had multiple sex partners within the same menstrual cycle, there are confidential ways to find answers. A paternity test can give you clarity and an accurate answer about the identity of the father.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>We are a safe space to slow down, breathe, talk through your situation and get answers without judgment.</p>



  <h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>I’m pregnant. How do I tell my partner?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



  <div style="height:6px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



  <p>Your life is about to change, but so is your partner’s. Figuring out how to tell him about the pregnancy can be overwhelming, especially if you don’t know how he will respond.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>It’s a good idea to figure out what you’re feeling first. Try journaling and thinking through why you might be feeling excited, nervous, or angry. Process with a friend first. When sharing this news with your partner, make sure to have this conversation in person and be open and honest about what you are feeling and want. Give him space to process this news and let him share what he is feeling too.&nbsp;</p>

  <h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>I’m pregnant. How do I tell my family?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



  <div style="height:4px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



  <p>Telling your parents you’re pregnant can be nerve-wracking. Especially if you are still in high school or college. What will they think? How will they react? Will they be disappointed?&nbsp;</p>



  <p>It might be helpful to talk to a trusted friend first. Getting the right support will help you feel more confident going forward in your conversation with your parents. Practicing what you want to say to your parents can help you accurately express what you are feeling. Once you&#8217;re ready, share the news with your parents. Remember, their initial reaction probably isn’t what they truly feel about you or the situation. This is the first they are hearing about your news and they also need time to process.</p>



  <p>No matter what your parents&#8217; reaction, you ultimately get the final say in your pregnancy decision.  Read more about how to tell your parents you’re pregnant in this article<a href="https://carenetps.org/how-do-i-tell-my-parents-im-pregnant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title=""> here.</a></p>



  <h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>I’m pregnant. But I’m still in school.</strong></h2>



  <div style="height:2px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



  <p>If you are still in school, pregnancy probably wasn&#8217;t a part of your plan. Just because it wasn’t a part of your plan doesn’t mean your plans have to come to a halt. It just means they might have to shift.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Often in life our plans never go exactly as planned. Unexpected changes can actually bring beautiful things into our life we didn’t even consider. These are the things that help us grow.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>If keeping the pregnancy is something you feel like you want to do, finishing school is possible. Our client advocates can offer the support to find the resources you need. You don’t have to figure this out alone.<a href="https://carenetps.org/make-appointment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title=""> Make an appointment today.</a></p>



  <h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>I’m pregnant. I can’t afford to take care of a child.&nbsp;</strong></h2>



  <div style="height:5px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



  <p>The reality is finances create a lot of stress and worry about pregnancy. If you feel like you are not in a place to financially support a child, or maybe even another child, take a breath. You have options.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Many organizations exist to help take the financial weight off you. These organizations offer things like medical bill assistance, healthcare, food, housing, clothing, education, and guidance in finding a stable job. We can help you connect with these organizations. <a href="https://carenetps.org/contact-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">Contact us</a>.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>If parenting isn’t something you feel ready for, there are several<a href="https://carenetps.org/adoption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title=""> adoption</a> options to choose from. Over the years, adoption has changed a lot and might be a great choice. It’s never a bad idea to explore all of your options.</p>

  <div style="height:2px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



  <p>Experiencing an unexpected pregnancy can sometimes feel like you only have one option&#8230;<a href="https://carenetps.org/abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="">abortion</a>. But abortion isn’t your only unplanned pregnancy option.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Whether it is finances, shame, or pressure from your partner or family, you have options to choose from that you get to make the final say in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p>You can parent with financial assistance or choose one of three adoption choices: open adoption, semi-open adoption, closed adoption. Read more about the different types of adoption and what might be right for you in<a href="https://carenetps.org/know-your-pregnancy-options/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title=""> this article.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p>If you decide none of these options are right for you, you can choose to terminate the pregnancy through a medical abortion or surgical abortion.

Pregnancy can be an overwhelming surprise, raising numerous questions about next steps. Understanding how far along you are can be achieved through tracking ovulation or a viability ultrasound, which can confirm gestational age and pregnancy viability. If you’re uncertain about the father’s identity, paternity testing is an option. Communicating the news to your partner requires honesty and openness, allowing both parties to process their feelings. Telling family members can be nerve-wracking, especially for students, but preparation and support can help ease the conversation.

Continuing education while pregnant is challenging but possible, as resources are available to support students. Financial concerns are common; numerous organizations offer assistance with medical bills, housing, and job placement. Exploring adoption is also an option, with various types available. Abortion is another choice, but it’s essential to consider all options carefully and seek an ultrasound beforehand for health reasons.

Support is crucial during this time, and Care Net of Puget Sound provides free consultations and resources to help navigate pregnancy decisions. You are not alone, and assistance is available to help you through this journey.
