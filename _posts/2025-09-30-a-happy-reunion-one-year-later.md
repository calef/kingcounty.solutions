**A Happy Reunion One Year Later**

A year ago, Engine 338 and Aid 331 crew responded to an emergency call on Highway 167, helping a mother give birth to her baby boy en route to the hospital. The mother and newborn were then transported to the hospital by King County Medics. On the baby boy's first birthday, the crew was delighted to reunite with him at Station 38. Baby AJ visited Firefighter Carlson, one of the responders who assisted during the roadside delivery. The crew expressed their joy and privilege to be part of this family's story.
