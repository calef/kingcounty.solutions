  One year ago, Engine 338 and Aid 331 responded to an unforgettable call along Highway 167. A mother en route to the hospital found herself welcoming her baby boy sooner than expected. Our crews were happy to assist and welcome him safely into the world, where King County Medics then transported baby and mom to the hospital.

  Yesterday, we were thrilled to reunite with Baby AJ at Station 38 as he celebrated his first birthday. He stopped by to visit Firefighter Carlson, one of the responders who helped during that unforgettable roadside delivery. Moments like these remind us why we do what we do, and it is a privilege to be a part of this family’s story.

  Happy 1st Birthday AJ!
