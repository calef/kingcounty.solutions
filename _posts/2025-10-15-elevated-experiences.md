In 2025, library operations were enhanced by extending hours, streamlining services, and preparing for a new energy-efficient sorter. Libraries at Mercer Island, Vashon Island, and Sammamish also expanded their hours within existing operational costs. Patron and staff computers were upgraded across many libraries. In 2026, further improvements to patron services are planned, including testing new charging lockers for personal electronic devices. A new customer service model is being developed with a focus on community collaboration, access, and inclusivity. An "innovation portal" is also being explored to facilitate staff brainstorming, grant funding pursuits, and scaling of successful projects.
