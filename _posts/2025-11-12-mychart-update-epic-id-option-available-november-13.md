  <p>Beginning November 13, you may notice that the MyChart login screen looks a little different. That’s because MyChart now offers the option to create an Epic ID — a single, secure login that can be used across all of your MyChart accounts. Whether you choose to create an Epic ID or continue logging in the way you always have, your experience will remain the same. Proxy access and other features are not changing.</p>



  <p>Creating your Epic ID is simple: Go to your Menu in your MyChart account and find the “Link My Accounts” page (in the section labeled “Sharing”). You should notice a banner on that page that invites you to link your MyChart account to MyChart Central. You can start the process of creating your Epic ID by clicking “Get Started” and following the instructions on your screen.</p>

Beginning Nov. 13, MyChart users will see an updated login screen featuring the option to create an Epic ID, a secure single login for accessing all MyChart accounts across various healthcare organizations. Users can decide whether to create an Epic ID or continue with their current login method, as both options will maintain the same user experience. Proxy access and other features will remain unchanged. 

To create an Epic ID, users can visit the “Link My Accounts” page in their MyChart account menu, where they will find a banner prompting them to link their account to MyChart Central. By clicking “Get Started,” they can follow on-screen instructions to complete the process. While the login screen will appear different, its functionality remains the same.
