Ida Deleza, known as Senior Chief Chikumbu in Mulanje, Malawi, has been a dedicated advocate for girls' education since her teaching career began over 20 years ago. After becoming chief in 2011, she focused on combating issues that lead to girls dropping out of school, such as early marriage and poverty. Her advocacy work included engaging with students to understand their challenges and collaborating with parents to support girls' return to school. Under her leadership, she implemented local bylaws to prevent girls from being excluded due to early pregnancies, resulting in several girls returning to education.

As a member of the Community Development Committee (CDC) and Vice-Chair of the CAMFED Malawi Board, Deleza actively oversees the distribution of educational resources and provides counseling to students. She passionately believes in the importance of education and women's leadership, emphasizing that educated individuals enrich their communities. Deleza also supports local women entrepreneurs and engages in community service, feeding numerous individuals and funding school fees for vulnerable children. Her story exemplifies the impact of dedicated leadership in advancing education and empowering women in Malawi.
