Bainbridge Island faces a significant affordability crisis, ranking in the bottom 3% for affordable housing availability according to the National Community Survey. The community has moved beyond debating solutions, recognizing the need for comprehensive action in light of state mandates like HB 1220, which requires an increase in affordable housing. The local economy is also at risk, as a substantial 79% of surveyed workers desire to live on the island but cannot afford it. This situation raises concerns about the sustainability of the island's charm and community identity if residents continue to be pushed away. Amidst national discussions on belonging and shared values, Bainbridge Island must confront these challenges and seek ways to support one another, emphasizing the need for affordable housing solutions that benefit the entire community.
