As SNAP benefits conclude on November 1st, many families may experience diminished food support. ReWA recognizes the importance of access to nutritious food and has assembled a list of local food bank resources for individuals and families. Various food programs are available to ensure access to healthy meals, fostering community empowerment.

Key resources include:

- **Hopelink** in Bellevue offers food support twice a month and plans to expand services starting November 3.
- **Renewal Food Bank** in Bellevue operates weekly with no service area restrictions.
- **St Vincent de Paul** and **SODO Community Market** in Seattle serve clients multiple days a week, requiring ID and bags.
- **Jewish Family Services** provides kosher food, while **El Centro de la Raza** specifically assists seniors and mobility-limited individuals.
- **West Seattle Food Bank** includes a pet pantry and operates several days a week.
- **FamilyWorks Food Bank** does not require ID and offers services on selected days.

These resources are vital for maintaining community health and well-being as families navigate the changing landscape of food assistance.
