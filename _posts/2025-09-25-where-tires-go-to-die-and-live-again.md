title: Where tires go to die (and live again)
topics: []

In 1887, John Boyd Dunlop invented the pneumatic tire, but bike tires typically last between 1,000 and 3,000 miles. Bike Works accepts tire donations, utilizing some for refurbished bikes and selling others as-is. Tires that are punctured, rotten, or worn are collected and taken annually to Liberty Tire in Portland for recycling. Loading these tires takes about ten people an hour, while unloading requires only two people twenty minutes. The recycling process grinds tires into reusable materials, including asphalt, playground surfacing, and various fuels. Recycling costs nearly a ton of tires amount to about 15 hours of labor, a $300 recycling fee, and additional fuel and maintenance expenses. Although many bike components are designed for obsolescence, the concept of a "forever bike" promotes minimizing waste. While a completely waste-free bicycle experience isn’t achievable, efforts can be made to reduce harm through mindful component choices. Bike Works encourages those with unused tires to donate, ensuring that as many as possible are reused or responsibly recycled.
