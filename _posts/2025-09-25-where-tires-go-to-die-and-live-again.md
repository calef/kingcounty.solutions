  <p>Back in 1887, Scottish veterinarian and inventor John Boyd Dunlop invented a pneumatic tire for his child&#8217;s tricycle. It wasn&#8217;t the first pneumatic tire patented—another Scot named Robert William Thompson gets the credit for his 1847 patent. When you google who made the first pneumatic tire, it mostly comes up Dunlop. But all you want to know is where do tires go to die.</p>

  <p>The average bike tire lasts between 1,000 and 3,000 miles if inflated properly, kept clear of sharps, and is stored away from the elements. Bike Works accepts the donation of tires in any form, and some are new enough for use on the <a href="https://shop.bikeworks.org/">refurbished bikes</a> we sell in the shop, while others are nice enough to sell as-is in the shop and during <a href="https://bikeworks.org/event/warehouse-sale/2025-10-04/">warehouse sales</a>. What about the punctured, the rotten, the tires worn to the threads? Well, we hoard them out back in a pile, and once a year we load up a van and haul them to be recycled at <a href="https://libertytire.com/">Liberty Tire</a> in Portland.</p>

  <p>It is said that the horse always pulls the strongest when it faces the barn, and there may be some synergistic relevance to loading and unloading tires. On average, it takes ten people about an hour to load a year’s worth of tires, though it takes two people about twenty minutes to unload them at the recycler. Needless to say, people aren’t horses and tires are a handful, particularly when they&#8217;re wet, dirty, and full of bugs.&nbsp;</p>

In 1887, John Boyd Dunlop invented the pneumatic tire, but bike tires typically last between 1,000 and 3,000 miles. Bike Works accepts tire donations, utilizing some for refurbished bikes and selling others as-is. Tires that are punctured, rotten, or worn are collected and taken annually to Liberty Tire in Portland for recycling. Loading these tires takes about ten people an hour, while unloading requires only two people twenty minutes. The recycling process grinds tires into reusable materials, including asphalt, playground surfacing, and various fuels. Recycling costs nearly a ton of tires amount to about 15 hours of labor, a $300 recycling fee, and additional fuel and maintenance expenses. Although many bike components are designed for obsolescence, the concept of a "forever bike" promotes minimizing waste. While a completely waste-free bicycle experience isn’t achievable, efforts can be made to reduce harm through mindful component choices. Bike Works encourages those with unused tires to donate, ensuring that as many as possible are reused or responsibly recycled.
