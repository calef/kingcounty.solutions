Falls Prevention Week highlights the critical need to address falls risk, particularly among older Americans, where falls lead to significant injuries and fatalities. Factors contributing to falls include balance issues, medication side effects, and visual impairments. Preventive measures include improving home safety by enhancing lighting, removing tripping hazards, and installing grab bars and handrails. 

Physical fitness is essential in reducing fall risk. Engaging in daily exercises like walking, swimming, or yoga can strengthen muscles and improve balance. Regular vision check-ups are vital to ensure prescriptions are up to date and help prevent vision-related falls. Communication with healthcare providers is crucial; patients should discuss any concerns about medications and their side effects. 

A tailored fitness program from a physical therapist can provide additional support, addressing specific fall risks. Maintaining an active lifestyle not only enhances physical well-being but also promotes social engagement, further supporting overall health in older adults.
