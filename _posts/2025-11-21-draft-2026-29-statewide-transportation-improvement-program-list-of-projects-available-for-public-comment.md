An annual compilation of prioritized transportation improvement projects in Washington State is now available for public review and comment until December 19. The draft 2026-2029 Statewide Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) includes over 1,100 projects funded by $5.3 billion in federal funds. These projects are identified through various planning processes involving state, metropolitan, regional, tribal, and local agencies. To authorize federal fund expenditures, projects utilizing Federal Highway Administration or Federal Transit Administration funds must be included in the STIP. The program encompasses a wide range of multimodal transportation projects, including highways, streets, railroads, transit hubs, and safety projects. The comment period is part of a larger community engagement effort that began during the development of individual improvement programs. Comments will be forwarded to relevant local agencies for consideration. Some county projects may not be included in the draft as they are required to finalize their improvement programs by year's end, with amendments added to the final STIP in January. Written comments can be submitted by mail or email, with a deadline set for 5 p.m. on December 19.
