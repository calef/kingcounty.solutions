  But when did thrifting get expensive?</p>\n<p>The question looms over many of the
  city’s seasoned thrift shoppers — a broad contingent that includes families sticking
  to a budget, environmentalists curbing their consumerism, savvy flippers making
  a buck and plenty more. The days of finding treasures at bargain prices in neighborhood
  stores seem to be coming to an end.</p>\n<p>Today, thrift shoppers of all stripes
  are reporting sticker shock at the very places where they once sought relief from
  high prices. Many in search of deep discounts are turning to online resale platforms
  instead. Meanwhile, brick-and-mortar thrift store operators are grappling with rising
  costs of their own. In this evolving environment, buyers and sellers alike are raising
  questions about whether thrift culture can even exist in a high cost of living city
  like Seattle.</p>\n<p>Longtime Seattle-area resident Tara Pham, 37, has seen the
  landscape undergo many changes over nearly 15 years of thrifting. Like many people,
  thrifting for her is no longer as affordable as it used to be.</p>\n<div class=\"multi-related-article-links

  stores in search of decent clothing for job interviews years ago. Then, she relied
  on thrift stores to dress her fast-growing child. She was a regular at the now-shuttered
  Value Village store in Ballard.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, she mostly frequents Goodwill
  in Everett and smaller consignment stores, but she relies more on hand-me-downs
  from friends and family.</p>\n<p>Thrifting is “fun and it’s meaningful,” she said.
  “But in terms of cost-savings, I don’t think it’s serving me that much.”</p>\n<p> A
  couple of converging factors have soured the experience for her. First, Pham has
  noticed that a flood of cheap items from fast-fashion brands like Shein are now
  drowning out the gems. The higher-quality products that she actually wants are getting
  priced so high that they’re sometimes more expensive than retail.</p>\n<p>“The other
  day, I saw a really nice sweater, but I was shocked,” she said. “It was priced at
  $120.”</p>\n<link rel=\"preload\" as=\"image\" href=\"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/02272025_9-thrift-stores_110248.jpg?d=780x498\"

  class=\"wp-block-heading\">“Gray economy” dynamics</h2>\n<p>Used-market pricing
  trends are difficult to measure. The modern secondhand shopping ecosystem is amorphous
  and informal, comprising traditional thrift chains like Goodwill and Value Village,
  pricier boutiques, garage sales, as well as enormous online marketplaces like Facebook,
  eBay, ThredUp and more.</p>\n<div class=\"ad-container u-ofh u-bg-dark-off-white

  \ </div>\n</div>\n<p>“It’s a gray economy,” said Jennifer Le Zotte, an associate
  professor of history at the University of North Carolina, Wilmington. While retail-level
  price data is widely available for tracking inflation among consumer goods and services,
  no such analog exists for the reuse and resale market.</p>\n<p>However, Le Zotte
  has noticed that the price gap between new and used goods has narrowed in recent
  years — attributable to both cheaper firsthand goods and greater interest in secondhand
  ones. Le Zotte is the author of “From Goodwill to Grunge,” a history of secondhand
  economies and styles.</p>\n<p>“Thrift stores aren’t exempt from the general rules
  of capitalist economies,” she said. “They respond to supply and demand.” As demand
  goes up, prices typically follow.</p>\n<div id=\"userMessagingInset\" class=\"user-messaging
  animate\"></div>\n<p>Cindy Isenhour, a professor at the University of Maine specializing
  in reuse markets, said that thrift stores traditionally see higher demand during
  periods of high cost of living. “When we see the price of new goods rise, and they
  become less affordable for some people,” she said, “there’s more demand for secondhand
  products.”</p>\n<p>Demand is also high because thrifting has become less stigmatized
  and more trendy over the past few decades. Today, Isenhour said, the practice is
  additionally associated with the virtue of environmentalism, especially in cities
  like Seattle.</p>\n<p>Further driving people to thrift is the proliferation of online
  resale platforms like Poshmark, Mercari and more, which have turned secondhand finds
  into a potentially lucrative source of gig income. The growth of these channels
  also reflects a change in the way that people, particularly among younger generations,
  shop secondhand. According to a report published last year by the consignment website
  ThredUp, 63% of consumers who purchased used clothing in 2023 made a purchase online
  — a 17 percentage point increase from the year prior.</p>\n<div class=\"ad-container

  has faced significant hikes in fuel, logistics and maintenance costs over the past
  five years, said CEO Libby Johnson McKee. The nonprofit operates 23 Goodwill stores
  in Washington and funds five job-training centers across King, Snohomish, Skagit,
  Whatcom and Kitsap counties. Labor costs have also ballooned rapidly: Between 2019
  and 2025, the minimum wage in Seattle increased by 25%.</p>\n<p>“All of those costs
  of doing business have gone up,” Johnson McKee said.</p>\n<div id=\"userMessagingPostscript\"

  there’s a reason why Goodwill shoppers might feel like they’re seeing higher prices,
  even as the average stays flat: a strategy known as product differentiation.</p>\n<p>Like
  many secondhand stores, Goodwill has been working to set more precise prices. The
  organization identifies expensive products, such as those from higher-end brands,
  and prices them accordingly. It also picks out items that tend to sell well online
  to list on Goodwill’s various digital platforms, which include an auction site,
  a fixed price store and an Amazon shop.</p>\n<div class=\"ad-container u-ofh u-bg-dark-off-white

  \ </div>\n</div>\n<p>“We don’t just do blanket pricing,” Johnson McKee said. While
  the practice isn’t new, she said that the organization has become better at product
  differentiation over time. Rather than setting all sweaters at a flat rate, for
  example, Goodwill has become adept at setting prices based on criteria such as quality,
  material and brand.</p>\n<p>The flip side of product differentiation is that some
  items — run-of-the-mill, lower-end, nonbranded, everyday <em>stuff</em> — can remain
  affordable or even get cheaper. In recent years, the organization has received a
  lot of donations of items from retailers such as Shein and Temu, online megastores
  that sell merchandise for rock-bottom prices. Brand-name jeans might get priced
  at $25 a pair or more, Johnson McKee said, while fast-fashion alternatives might
  get priced at $5 or less.</p>\n<p>“People can find something that fits their wallet
  across the range of products that we have, from clothing to home goods,” she said.</p>\n<h2
  class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tough choices</h2>\n<p>Cynical shoppers might bristle
  at the idea of thrift stores raising prices on donated items. But without enough
  revenue, the stores might face shutting down altogether.</p>\n<p>Last year Lifelong,
  a nonprofit that provides social services and food to low-income people in Washington,
  made the decision to close its thrift store on Capitol Hill, a beloved institution
  and mainstay in the community’s thrift scene since 2001. It will shutter when its
  lease ends this month.</p>\n<link rel=\"preload\" as=\"image\" href=\"https://images.seattletimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/02272025_6-thrift-stores_110242.jpg?d=780x484\"

  legally separate entity, the thrift store was originally intended to be a community
  hub and a source of additional funding for the nonprofit. But it hasn’t generated
  enough surplus revenue to support the organization in at least five years, said
  CEO Erica Sessle. While other retail businesses might struggle to keep prices low,
  thrift stores are particularly constrained in how much they can pass costs to shoppers
  without alienating them.</p>\n<div class=\"ad-container u-ofh u-bg-dark-off-white

  lose your customers.”</p>\n<p>Karin Virnig, 62, has been thrift shopping her whole

  the hit to her wallet, she understands where many of the increases are coming from.
  “I know they’re covering rent,” she said. “They’re covering minimum wage. They’re
  covering utilities. They’re covering all these expenses that we can’t even think
  about.”</p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Knock-on effects of higher prices</h2>\n<p>When
  thrift becomes more expensive, lower-income shoppers often find themselves priced
  out of the shopping experience altogether. Instead, they might turn to alternative
  free resources to meet basic needs.</p>\n<p>Organizations like the Jubilee Women’s
  Center, which has a boutique that gives out clothing for free, are seeing an increase
  in need among clients, attributable directly to higher prices in the secondhand
  market.</p>\n<p>“The women that we serve are definitely being affected,” said Mady
  Whitnah, operations and special projects manager. “I hear all the time from people
  coming in, saying that they used to shop at Goodwill but it’s just too expensive
  now.” The boutique’s clients are noticing similar trends across other consignment
  and secondhand stores, as well.</p>\n<div class=\"ad-container u-ofh u-bg-dark-off-white

  \ </div>\n</div>\n<p>The boutique operates by appointment, and growing demand means
  that the wait time for a time slot has roughly doubled, Whitnah estimates.</p>\n<p>For
  many, higher demand at thrift stores simply reflects the economic reality of inflation.</p>\n<p>“Rising
  prices mean something in your budget has to give,” said Robbin Peterson, development
  director of the West Seattle Food Bank, which runs a free clothing bank called Clothesline.
  “If suddenly your rent goes up, which we’ve seen all over Seattle, maybe now they
  can’t afford their food budget. Or because food then went up so high, now they can’t
  afford to clothe their kids.”</p>\n<p>Demand at Clothesline has more than doubled
  in the past two years. In the fiscal year ending in June 2022, Peterson estimates
  that the bank gave out just under 32,000 pieces of clothing. For the fiscal year
  ending in June 2024, it gave out almost 85,000.</p>\n<p>“We started seeing an increased
  need of clients coming to us more often for clothes. When asked about it, many of
  them were saying they can’t afford to shop at thrift stores anymore,” Peterson said.</p>\n<p>Clothesline
  relies on donations, though there’s been a slight decline in higher-quality ones,
  Peterson said. That, along with skyrocketing need, means Clothesline is now putting
  more clothes onto shelves that it normally would have rejected. Whatever Clothesline
  doesn’t sell it hauls off to Goodwill.</p>\n<div class=\"ad-container u-ofh u-bg-dark-off-white

  class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>More people are reselling online</strong></h2>\n<p>The
  secondhand goods market is undergoing changes on multiple fronts. Not only are more
  people participating in the economy as shoppers, but many are also becoming sellers
  themselves.</p>\n<p>Pam Mandel, 61, has been an avid thrifter for three decades.
  A technical writer living in West Seattle, she’s struggled to find work over the
  past two years. Though she’s not strained, she does feel economically uncertain
  right now.</p>\n<p>Previously, she would donate bags full of used clothing to her
  local Goodwill, where she also shops. But the overall quality of the selection at
  thrift stores has gone down, she said, and what remains has gotten pricey. Recently,
  she found a used Lodge brand cast iron pan listed for the same price as it would
  cost to order a new one on Amazon, shipping included.</p>\n<p>As frustrating as
  that is, Mandel recognizes her role in shaping what ends up in the thrift market.
  Rather than donating her used stuff, she tries to resell it first on Poshmark.</p>\n<p>“I
  get to set the price,” she said. “I had some cool vintage things that I’ve sold,
  and previously I would have been like, ‘Well, I’m not wearing this. It doesn’t fit
  anymore. I’m going to donate it.’ And now I’m looking in my closet and thinking,
  ‘Should I list that?’”</p>\n<p>She’s made a couple of hundred bucks in the two years
  since she started. “It’s not nothing. It’s good grocery money.”</p>\n<div class=\"ad-container

  \ </div>\n</div>\n<p>Mandel’s experience is a microcosm of how consumer relationships
  are changing, not just to thrift stores but to used goods as a whole. It might not
  be as cheap as it used to be to shop secondhand anymore, but getting rid of stuff
  can pay higher dividends than ever.</p>\n<p>Thrifting remains a joy for many in
  Seattle, even if it requires a bit more elbow grease to find a bargain.</p>\n<p>Albert
  Chang, 29, started thrift shopping five years ago. With concerns about overproduction
  and a tight budget, he hit up thrift stores to decorate his first apartment. Today,
  his favorite place to thrift is the Goodwill store on South Dearborn Street. Like
  others, he’s noticed higher prices.</p>\n<p>“I think Goodwill, especially with their
  size and their network, has been pushing the boundaries a bit in terms of the prices,”
  he said. “They’ve gotten a lot better at identifying brand names or items of higher
  value.”</p>\n<p>In turn, he’s become more discerning himself, better at lasering
  in on goods that were inadvertently underpriced. Sure, he has to look a bit harder,
  he said, but “that’s part of the adventure.”</p>    <div id=\"userMessagingIn-story\"></div>\n

  reporter\n\n[Affordability crisis](https://www.seattletimes.com/tag/affordability/)\n
  \n\nThis story is part of a Seattle Times focus on the affordability crisis in the
  Northwest. We explore the high cost of living and wealth disparities that shape
  our region; examine policies that impact prices for everything from housing to health
  care; and offer tips for making your money go further.\n\nSeattle loves to shop
  secondhand. But when did thrifting get expensive?\n\nThe question looms over many
  of the city’s seasoned thrift shoppers — a broad contingent that includes families
  sticking to a budget, environmentalists curbing their consumerism, savvy flippers
  making a buck and plenty more. The days of finding treasures at bargain prices in
  neighborhood stores seem to be coming to an end.\n\nToday, thrift shoppers of all
  stripes are reporting sticker shock at the very places where they once sought relief
  from high prices. Many in search of deep discounts are turning to online resale
  platforms instead. Meanwhile, brick-and-mortar thrift store operators are grappling
  with rising costs of their own. In this evolving environment, buyers and sellers
  alike are raising questions about whether thrift culture can even exist in a high
  cost of living city like Seattle.\n\nLongtime Seattle-area resident Tara Pham, 37,
  has seen the landscape undergo many changes over nearly 15 years of thrifting. Like
  many people, thrifting for her is no longer as affordable as it used to be.\n\n###

  remembers bouncing around the University District’s thrift stores in search of decent
  clothing for job interviews years ago. Then, she relied on thrift stores to dress
  her fast-growing child. She was a regular at the now-shuttered Value Village store
  in Ballard.\n\nNowadays, she mostly frequents Goodwill in Everett and smaller consignment
  stores, but she relies more on hand-me-downs from friends and family.\n\nThrifting
  is “fun and it’s meaningful,” she said. “But in terms of cost-savings, I don’t think
  it’s serving me that much.”\n\n&nbsp;A couple of converging factors have soured
  the experience for her. First, Pham has noticed that a flood of cheap items from
  fast-fashion brands like Shein are now drowning out the gems. The higher-quality
  products that she actually wants are getting priced so high that they’re sometimes
  more expensive than retail.\n\n“The other day, I saw a really nice sweater, but
  I was shocked,” she said. “It was priced at $120.”\n\n<link rel=\"preload\" as=\"image\"

  “Gray economy” dynamics\n\nUsed-market pricing trends are difficult to measure.
  The modern secondhand shopping ecosystem is amorphous and informal, comprising traditional
  thrift chains like Goodwill and Value Village, pricier boutiques, garage sales,
  as well as enormous online marketplaces like Facebook, eBay, ThredUp and more.\n\nAdvertising\n\n“It’s
  a gray economy,” said Jennifer Le Zotte, an associate professor of history at the
  University of North Carolina, Wilmington. While retail-level price data is widely
  available for tracking inflation among consumer goods and services, no such analog
  exists for the reuse and resale market.\n\nHowever, Le Zotte has noticed that the
  price gap between new and used goods has narrowed in recent years — attributable
  to both cheaper firsthand goods and greater interest in secondhand ones. Le Zotte
  is the author of “From Goodwill to Grunge,”&nbsp;a history of secondhand economies
  and styles.\n\n“Thrift stores aren’t exempt from the general rules of capitalist
  economies,” she said. “They respond to supply and demand.” As demand goes up, prices
  typically follow.\n\nCindy Isenhour, a professor at the University of Maine specializing
  in reuse markets, said that thrift stores traditionally see higher demand during
  periods of high cost of living. “When we see the price of new goods rise, and they
  become less affordable for some people,” she said, “there’s more demand for secondhand
  products.”\n\nDemand is also high because thrifting has become less stigmatized
  and more trendy over the past few decades. Today, Isenhour said, the practice is
  additionally associated with the virtue of environmentalism, especially in cities
  like Seattle.\n\nFurther driving people to thrift is the proliferation of online
  resale platforms like Poshmark, Mercari and more, which have turned secondhand finds
  into a potentially lucrative source of gig income. The growth of these channels
  also reflects a change in the way that people, particularly among younger generations,
  shop secondhand. According to a report published last year by the consignment website
  ThredUp, 63% of consumers who purchased used clothing in 2023 made a purchase online
  — a 17 percentage point increase from the year prior.\n\nAdvertising\n\n<link rel=\"preload\"

  in driving up thrift prices, Isenhour said. “It’s a really multidimensional phenomenon.”\n\nMichael
  Lambert, 25, has been thrift shopping since he was in high school, drawn to it because
  he believed it to be a more sustainable option than buying new things. Today, he
  primarily shops at the Goodwill store in Ballard, but he worries that prices are
  getting so high that they might dissuade people from buying used.\n\nLambert, a
  revenue management analyst, has tried to maintain a budget of $100 to $200 a year
  for clothing. He uses basic T-shirt prices as a benchmark for costs over time.\n\n##

  price trends on the Eastside. A regular shopper at Value Village stores in Redmond,
  Issaquah and Woodinville, she remembers buying T-shirts for $2.99 and $3.99; today,
  they’ve at least doubled in price, costing sometimes more than brand-new T-shirts
  at Old Navy. In recent trips, Wood, who works at a school district, said that she’s
  seen used kitchenware like spatulas priced higher used than new ones at Target.\n\n“For
  people who want to just recycle something without contributing to waste,” she said,
  “it’s becoming cost prohibitive.”\n\n## Sponsored\n\n## Running a thrift store isn’t
  cheap\n\nThrift stores today also have to contend with rising operational costs,
  and that means passing some on to shoppers.\n\nEvergreen Goodwill, one of the biggest
  thrift store networks in the Seattle region and beyond, has faced significant hikes
  in fuel, logistics and maintenance costs over the past five years, said CEO Libby
  Johnson McKee. The nonprofit operates 23 Goodwill stores in Washington and funds
  five job-training centers across King, Snohomish, Skagit, Whatcom and Kitsap counties.
  Labor costs have also ballooned rapidly: Between 2019 and 2025, the minimum wage
  in Seattle increased by 25%.\n\n“All of those costs of doing business have gone
  up,” Johnson McKee said.\n\nEvergreen Goodwill still has made a concerted effort
  to stay affordable, she said. The average product price has increased by just 14
  cents between 2019 and today, according to the organization.\n\n<link rel=\"preload\"

  - 335px), 630px\" fetchpriority=\"high\">\n\nBut there’s a reason why Goodwill shoppers
  might feel like they’re seeing higher prices, even as the average stays flat: a
  strategy known as product differentiation.\n\nLike many secondhand stores, Goodwill
  has been working to set more precise prices. The organization identifies expensive
  products, such as those from higher-end brands, and prices them accordingly. It
  also picks out items that tend to sell well online to list on Goodwill’s various
  digital platforms, which include an auction site, a fixed price store and an Amazon
  shop.\n\nAdvertising\n\n“We don’t just do blanket pricing,” Johnson McKee said.
  While the practice isn’t new, she said that the organization has become better at
  product differentiation over time. Rather than setting all sweaters at a flat rate,
  for example, Goodwill has become adept at setting prices based on criteria such
  as quality, material and brand.\n\nThe flip side of product differentiation is that
  some items — run-of-the-mill, lower-end, nonbranded, everyday _stuff_ — can remain
  affordable or even get cheaper. In recent years, the organization has received a
  lot of donations of items from retailers such as Shein and Temu, online megastores
  that sell merchandise for rock-bottom prices. Brand-name jeans might get priced
  at $25 a pair or more, Johnson McKee said, while fast-fashion alternatives might
  get priced at $5 or less.\n\n“People can find something that fits their wallet across
  the range of products that we have, from clothing to home goods,” she said.\n\n##
  Tough choices\n\nCynical shoppers might bristle at the idea of thrift stores raising
  prices on donated items. But without enough revenue, the stores might face shutting
  down altogether.\n\nLast year Lifelong, a nonprofit that provides social services
  and food to low-income people in Washington, made the decision to close its thrift
  store on Capitol Hill, a beloved institution and mainstay in the community’s thrift
  scene since 2001. It will shutter when its lease ends this month.\n\n<link rel=\"preload\"

  store was originally intended to be a community hub and a source of additional funding
  for the nonprofit. But it hasn’t generated enough surplus revenue to support the
  organization in at least five years, said CEO Erica Sessle. While other retail businesses
  might struggle to keep prices low, thrift stores are particularly constrained in
  how much they can pass costs to shoppers without alienating them.\n\nAdvertising\n\n“The
  levers that you have to make a sustainable business are different in a thrift store
  environment,” Sessle said. “You can only adjust the prices within a certain range
  in order to keep your customers happy, or else you’ll lose your customers.”\n\nKarin
  Virnig, 62, has been thrift shopping her whole life. Over the past two decades,
  she estimates that prices have gone up by 30% to 40%. Today, she shops less and
  tries to go to Goodwill only on Wednesdays, when shoppers 62 and over get 20% off.\n\n<link

  understands where many of the increases are coming from. “I know they’re covering
  rent,” she said. “They’re covering minimum wage. They’re covering utilities. They’re
  covering all these expenses that we can’t even think about.”\n\n## Knock-on effects
  of higher prices\n\nWhen thrift becomes more expensive, lower-income shoppers often
  find themselves priced out of the shopping experience altogether. Instead, they
  might turn to alternative free resources to meet basic needs.\n\nOrganizations like
  the Jubilee Women’s Center, which has a boutique that gives out clothing for free,
  are seeing an increase in need among clients, attributable directly to higher prices
  in the secondhand market.\n\n“The women that we serve are definitely being affected,”
  said Mady Whitnah, operations and special projects manager. “I hear all the time
  from people coming in, saying that they used to shop at Goodwill but it’s just too
  expensive now.” The boutique’s clients are noticing similar trends across other
  consignment and secondhand stores, as well.\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe boutique operates
  by appointment, and growing demand means that the wait time for a time slot has
  roughly doubled, Whitnah estimates.\n\nFor many, higher demand at thrift stores
  simply reflects the economic reality of inflation.\n\n“Rising prices mean something
  in your budget has to give,” said Robbin Peterson, development director of the West
  Seattle Food Bank, which runs a free clothing bank called Clothesline. “If suddenly
  your rent goes up, which we’ve seen all over Seattle, maybe now they can’t afford
  their food budget. Or because food then went up so high, now they can’t afford to
  clothe their kids.”\n\nDemand at Clothesline has more than doubled in the past two
  years. In the fiscal year ending in June 2022, Peterson estimates that the bank
  gave out just under 32,000 pieces of clothing. For the fiscal year ending in June
  2024, it gave out almost 85,000.\n\n“We started seeing an increased need of clients
  coming to us more often for clothes. When asked about it, many of them were saying
  they can’t afford to shop at thrift stores anymore,” Peterson said.\n\nClothesline
  relies on donations, though there’s been a slight decline in higher-quality ones,
  Peterson said. That, along with skyrocketing need, means Clothesline is now putting
  more clothes onto shelves that it normally would have rejected. Whatever Clothesline
  doesn’t sell it hauls off to Goodwill.\n\nAdvertising\n\n<link rel=\"preload\" as=\"image\"

  secondhand goods market is undergoing changes on multiple fronts. Not only are more
  people participating in the economy as shoppers, but many are also becoming sellers
  themselves.\n\nPam Mandel, 61, has been an avid thrifter for three decades. A technical
  writer living in West Seattle, she’s struggled to find work over the past two years.
  Though she’s not strained, she does feel economically uncertain right now.\n\nPreviously,
  she would donate bags full of used clothing to her local Goodwill, where she also
  shops. But the overall quality of the selection at thrift stores has gone down,
  she said, and what remains has gotten pricey. Recently, she found a used Lodge brand
  cast iron pan listed for the same price as it would cost to order a new one on Amazon,
  shipping included.\n\nAs frustrating as that is, Mandel recognizes her role in shaping
  what ends up in the thrift market. Rather than donating her used stuff, she tries
  to resell it first on Poshmark.\n\n“I get to set the price,” she said. “I had some
  cool vintage things that I’ve sold, and previously I would have been like, ‘Well,
  I’m not wearing this. It doesn’t fit anymore. I’m going to donate it.’ And now I’m
  looking in my closet and thinking, ‘Should I list that?’”\n\nShe’s made a couple
  of hundred bucks in the two years since she started. “It’s not nothing. It’s good
  grocery money.”\n\nAdvertising\n\nMandel’s experience is a microcosm of how consumer
  relationships are changing, not just to thrift stores but to used goods as a whole.
  It might not be as cheap as it used to be to shop secondhand anymore, but getting
  rid of stuff can pay higher dividends than ever.\n\nThrifting remains a joy for
  many in Seattle, even if it requires a bit more elbow grease to find a bargain.\n\nAlbert
  Chang, 29, started thrift shopping five years ago. With concerns about overproduction
  and a tight budget, he hit up thrift stores to decorate his first apartment. Today,
  his favorite place to thrift is the Goodwill store on South Dearborn Street. Like
  others, he’s noticed higher prices.\n\n“I think Goodwill, especially with their
  size and their network, has been pushing the boundaries a bit in terms of the prices,”
  he said. “They’ve gotten a lot better at identifying brand names or items of higher
  value.”\n\nIn turn, he’s become more discerning himself, better at lasering in on
  goods that were inadvertently underpriced. Sure, he has to look a bit harder, he
  said, but “that’s part of the adventure.”\n\nJessica Fu: 206-464-8502 or [jfu@seattletimes.com](mailto:jfu@seattletimes.com).

Thrift stores in the Seattle area continue to attract shoppers seeking unique finds at affordable prices, despite rising costs and changing consumer habits. Many stores, such as Goodwill and Value Village, have adapted to these challenges by embracing e-commerce and enhancing their in-store experiences. Shoppers can find a wide range of items, including vintage clothing, furniture, and household goods, often at a fraction of retail prices. The popularity of thrifting has surged, particularly among younger generations who appreciate sustainable shopping and the thrill of discovering hidden treasures. However, some thrift stores face inventory shortages due to decreased donations during the pandemic. To counter this, stores are encouraging donations through promotional efforts and community outreach. Overall, while the thrift store landscape is evolving, many still offer valuable bargains and a sense of community for shoppers.
