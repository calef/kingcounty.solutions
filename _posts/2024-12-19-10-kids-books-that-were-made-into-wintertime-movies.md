As winter approaches and schools close, families can engage children in reading by watching movies adapted from beloved wintertime books. This activity not only entertains but also fosters comprehension skills through discussions about differences between the book and its film version. Suggested stories include:

- **The Polar Express** by Chris Van Allsburg, a timeless classic.
- **A Christmas Carol** by Charles Dickens, featuring iconic characters like Kermit the Frog.
- **The Snowy Day** by Ezra Jack Keats, which has seen various adaptations since its 1962 debut.
- **Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone** by J.K. Rowling, often associated with winter due to its festive film releases.
- **The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe** by C.S. Lewis, set in a perpetual winter.
- **Eloise at Christmastime** by Kay Thompson, capturing the charm of a young girl living at the Plaza.
- **The Lord of the Rings** and **The Hobbit** by J.R.R. Tolkien, with debates over their seasonal setting.
- **Ice Princess**, a film tied to a book published alongside it.
- **How the Grinch Stole Christmas** by Dr. Seuss, a classic since 1957.
- **The Nutcracker and the Mouse King** by E.T.A. Hoffman, which inspired several adaptations, including ballet. 

These stories provide a cozy reading experience paired with warm beverages during the chilly season.
