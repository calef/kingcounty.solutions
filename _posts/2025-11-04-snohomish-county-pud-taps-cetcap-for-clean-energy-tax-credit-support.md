topics: []

The Snohomish County Public Utility District (PUD) has partnered with the City of Everett to develop a 400-kW solar project in South Everett, capable of powering around 30 homes annually. The PUD has sought assistance from the Washington Clean Energy Tax Credit Assistance Program (CETCAP) to help navigate the tax provisions of the Clean Energy Investment Credit. With the support of Lawyers for Good Government and Giraffe Financial, CETCAP has helped more than 150 organizations secure hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax credits. The total project cost of $2.3 million was funded by the Washington state Clean Energy Fund and Washington Community Solar Expansion Fund.
