The Commercial Aviation Work Group in Washington State will hold its fifth public hybrid meeting on December 9, 2025, at Boeing Field in Seattle, starting at 10 a.m. This meeting aims to assess the state's long-term commercial aviation and transportation needs. Members of the work group are tasked with exploring alternatives for increasing aviation capacity and utilizing existing airports, without pursuing the construction of new airports. Public participation is encouraged, with a designated 30-minute comment period for attendees both in person and online via Zoom. Additionally, the public can submit comments anytime through an online contact form. The meeting will be streamed live on TVW, and those wishing to attend remotely must pre-register. Free parking is available at the venue, and temporary internet access is provided for those without broadband. This group operates independently from the previous Commercial Aviation Coordinating Commission, which focused on identifying potential locations for future commercial aviation services and concluded its activities in 2023.
