  may not grab news headlines like fentanyl or meth, but alcoholism is one of the
  deadliest addictions, and stopping alcohol use comes with its own dangers. From
  alcohol withdrawal syndrome to delirium tremens, we’ll do a deep dive into all the
  alcohol-related detox dangers and explore how to quit safely (spoiler alert: You
  should seek the help of a trained professional).</p>\n<h2><strong>What Alcohol Addiction
  or Overuse Does to the Body</strong></h2>\n<p>A central nervous system depressant,
  alcohol slows brain activity and alters how your body functions. Over time, your
  brain adapts by working harder to stay alert, increasing excitatory chemicals. This
  constant push-pull between alcohol’s sedative effects and the brain’s compensation
  puts your body under stress.</p>\n<p>Some immediate effects of heavy drinking include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Slurred
  speech and impaired coordination</li>\n<li>Mood swings or aggression</li>\n<li>Memory

  (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Association)</p>\n<p>Alcohol poisoning
  is another risk of extensive drinking. It occurs when someone drinks so much that
  their body can’t process the alcohol quickly enough. The condition can be fatal,
  so it’s important to know the signs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Confusion or inability to wake
  up</li>\n<li>Vomiting</li>\n<li>Slow or irregular breathing</li>\n<li>Seizures</li>\n<li>Pale,
  bluish, or clammy skin</li>\n<li>Low body temperature</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Roughly
  178,000 people die from excessive alcohol use each year in the United States. –
  </em><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/about-alcohol-use/\"><em>Centers for
  Disease Control</em></a></p>\n<h2><strong>The Toll of Long-Term Overuse</strong></h2>\n<p>Chronic
  alcohol use affects nearly every one of the body’s organ systems. Over months or
  years, heavy drinking can lead to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Liver disease:</strong>
  fatty liver, hepatitis, cirrhosis</li>\n<li><strong>Heart problems:</strong> high
  blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, increased stroke risk</li>\n<li><strong>Digestive
  issues:</strong> gastritis, ulcers, pancreatitis</li>\n<li><strong>Brain changes:</strong>
  memory problems, cognitive decline, neuropathy</li>\n<li><strong>Mental health struggles:</strong>
  depression, anxiety, worsening mood disorders</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These effects of alcohol
  overuse also make withdrawal more dangerous because your body has adapted to alcohol’s
  presence, so removing it suddenly can have severe consequences.</p>\n<h2><strong>Why
  It’s So Important to Get Help to Quit Safely</strong></h2>\n<p>Because your brain
  and body have become dependent on alcohol, suddenly stopping drinking can shock
  your system. Medically supervised detox ensures that withdrawal symptoms are managed
  safely, preventing complications like seizures, severe dehydration, and delirium
  tremens (DTs).</p>\n<h2><strong>The Alcohol Withdrawal Process </strong></h2>\n<p>One
  of the reasons heavy drinkers are reluctant to quit alcohol is that the withdrawal
  process can be notoriously harrowing. Withdrawal symptoms can begin as early as
  6-12 hours after your last drink and may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Anxiety, tremors,
  sweating, nausea, insomnia</li>\n<li>Elevated heart rate and blood pressure</li>\n<li>Hallucinations</li>\n<li>Seizures</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The
  most severe alcohol withdrawal symptoms usually occur between 48-72 hours after
  the last drink. This is the window when a condition known as delirium tremens is
  more likely to develop.</p>\n<h2><strong>Delirium Tremens: The Most Severe Form
  of Withdrawal</strong></h2>\n<p>Delirium tremens (DTs) are the most dangerous alcohol
  withdrawal complication, and, according to <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/3909-alcoholism\">The
  Cleveland Clinic</a>, DTs can be life-threatening. They typically develop 1-4 days
  after withdrawal begins in those who have been drinking heavily for years.</p>\n<p>Delirium
  tremens cause extreme hyperactivity of the autonomic nervous system, which can result
  in dangerous spikes in heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature.</p>\n<p>DT
  symptoms include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Severe confusion and disorientation</li>\n<li>Visual,
  auditory, or tactile hallucinations</li>\n<li>Agitation</li>\n<li>High fever and
  heavy sweating</li>\n<li>Seizures</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6761825/\">The
  National Library of Medicine</a> reports that up to 5% of patients in alcohol withdrawal
  may develop DTs. Without treatment, the risk of death can be as high as 37% — but
  with proper medication and medical monitoring, the risk drops significantly.</p>\n<p>Women
  may present with fewer symptoms than men, making DTs harder to diagnose. Co-occurring
  medical problems (such as infections, altered blood chemistry, or Wernicke’s syndrome,
  a serious neurological disorder most commonly linked to <strong>chronic alcohol
  misuse</strong> and <strong>a vitamin B1 deficiency</strong>) can make symptoms
  worse, which is why professional care is essential.</p>\n<h2><strong>Why Quitting
  “Cold Turkey” Can Be Dangerous</strong></h2>\n<p>Is it time to get help for your
  alcohol use? We’ve established that alcohol addiction is hazardous to your health,
  but stopping alcohol abruptly can send your body into crisis. People who are hospitalized
  for surgery or other medical reasons are at increased risk of developing DTs because
  their drinking is suddenly interrupted. For anyone at home, quitting cold turkey
  without supervision can result in seizures, cardiac complications, or even death.</p>\n<h2><strong>What
  is Medically Managed Detox?</strong></h2>\n<p>That’s why it’s important not to try
  to quit alcohol on your own. In a professional detox program, you are monitored
  24/7, so they can prevent and respond to complications.</p>\n<p>Professional detox
  may include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Non-addictive medication assistance</strong>
  to prevent seizures and stabilize vital signs</li>\n<li><strong>IV fluids and electrolytes</strong>
  to prevent dehydration</li>\n<li><strong>Nutritional support</strong> (thiamine
  and vitamins to prevent brain damage)</li>\n<li><strong>Monitoring of vital signs</strong>
  to catch complications early</li>\n<li><strong>Emotional support</strong> to reduce
  anxiety and prepare you for the next phase of treatment</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This approach
  is not just about comfort — it is about keeping you safe.</p>\n<h2><strong>What
  Detox Looks Like at Lakeside-Milam</strong></h2>\n<p>The acute alcohol withdrawal
  phase generally lasts 3-7 days, but some symptoms (like anxiety or sleep disturbances)
  can persist for weeks. Continued treatment through a residential or outpatient program,
  group therapy, or aftercare support is crucial for lasting recovery.</p>\n<p>At
  Lakeside-Milam, <a href=\"https://lakesidemilam.com/seattle-drug-detox/\">detox</a>
  is a highly structured process focused on both safety and long-term recovery. It
  includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Individualized medical evaluation &#8211; </strong>Each
  client’s withdrawal plan is tailored to their history and needs.</li>\n<li><strong>24/7
  inpatient monitoring &#8211;</strong> Vital signs, hydration, and complications
  (like seizures or DTs) are closely monitored.</li>\n<li><strong>Step-down care &#8211;</strong>
  After detox (usually up to seven days), clients transition into residential treatment
  followed by partial hospitalization (PHP) and/or an intensive outpatient program
  (IOP) to continue treatment in a structured setting.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ongoing substance
  use disorder treatment may also include <a href=\"https://lakesidemilam.com/washington-mat/\">medication-assisted
  treatment</a> (aka MAT). Physicians at Lakeside Milam may prescribe naltrexone and
  acamprosate for alcohol addiction. These medications reduce cravings and prevent
  relapse by blocking the effects of alcohol, making it harder for individuals to
  experience the pleasure associated with alcohol use.</p>\n<h2><strong>Detox is Just
  the Beginning</strong></h2>\n<p>At Lakeside-Milam, we believe detox is just the
  start of someone’s recovery journey. For the best chance of maintaining long-term
  sobriety, detox should be followed by a comprehensive treatment program that includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>A
  focus on physical health &#8211; </strong>Physical health often suffers during addiction.
  Medical evaluations and coordination with primary care ensure health issues are
  treated alongside an alcohol addiction.</li>\n<li><strong>Education about addiction
  &#8211;</strong>You need to understand how you got here in order to not end up back
  here. Learning how addiction works reduces denial and helps patients commit to recovery.</li>\n<li><strong>Group
  counseling &#8211; </strong>Addiction thrives in secrecy and isolation. Peer support
  provides community, helping to break isolation patterns and encourage accountability.</li>\n<li><strong>Changing

  Therapy to help clients identify and change irrational thoughts that fuel addiction.</li>\n<li><strong>Personalized

---

Quitting alcohol without professional support can lead to serious health risks, including delirium tremens (DTs), a severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome characterized by confusion, hallucinations, and severe agitation. DTs can be life-threatening and often require medical intervention. Other dangers of detoxing alone include seizures and complications from underlying health conditions exacerbated by withdrawal.

Individuals attempting to quit alcohol must understand that withdrawal symptoms can vary greatly in severity and duration, making it crucial to seek medical assistance. Professional detox programs provide supervised care, ensuring safety and support throughout the withdrawal process. They can also address co-occurring mental health issues, which often accompany alcohol use disorders.

In addition to DTs, individuals may experience anxiety, depression, or other psychological symptoms during detox, underscoring the need for comprehensive treatment strategies. Professional detox services offer a structured environment to mitigate risks and improve the chances of successful recovery. Overall, quitting alcohol safely requires careful consideration and often the guidance of trained professionals to navigate the potential dangers of withdrawal.
