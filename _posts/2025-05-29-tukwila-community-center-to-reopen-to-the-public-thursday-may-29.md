The Tukwila Community Center is set to reopen following a temporary closure caused by flooding from a burst pipe. However, some areas of the center, including the lobby, teen room, meeting rooms, dance studio, and fitness center, will remain closed until further notice. In the meantime, select recreation programs will be held in the community center's gym and the west wing of the building. The center's revised opening hours are Thursday, May 29, from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Friday, May 30, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Future plans for the center's operations will be communicated to the public.
