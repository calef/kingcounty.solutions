Travelers in the greater Seattle area should prepare for significant delays and road closures starting late Friday evening, November 21, through early Monday, November 24. Key construction activities include lane reductions on southbound Interstate 5 over the Ship Canal Bridge, ramp closures at the I-405/State Route 522 interchange, and the closure of eastbound SR 520 from I-5 to Montlake Boulevard. 

The lane reductions on I-5 will begin at 10 p.m. Friday, with additional closures for the I-405 project starting at the same time. The eastbound SR 520 closure will start at 11 p.m. Friday, affecting access from I-5. All work is scheduled to complete by 5 a.m. Monday, just before the Monday morning commute.

This weekend marks the fourth of six scheduled weekends for drainage improvements as part of the Revive I-5 project, with crews moving to the right lanes ahead of schedule. Travelers are advised to expect delays and use alternate routes when necessary. The WSDOT encourages planning ahead with real-time travel information to minimize traffic disruptions.
