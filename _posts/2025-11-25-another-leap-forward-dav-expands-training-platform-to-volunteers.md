DAV is expanding its Interactive Training, Resource, Advocacy and Knowledge system (iTRAK) to include volunteer chapter and department service officers, enhancing their capacity to assist veterans in navigating the benefits claims process. Since its introduction in 2016, iTRAK has provided national service officers with essential training and resources, incorporating Title 38 regulations and past Board of Veterans’ Appeals decisions. This system has significantly improved advocacy for veterans by equipping advocates with the necessary tools to understand and address the complexities of the benefits system. By extending access to volunteers, DAV aims to ensure that all advocates, whether employees or volunteers, are well-prepared to support veterans effectively. This initiative is seen as a vital step in evolving DAV’s mission to provide the best possible service to veterans and their families, reinforcing the organization’s commitment to adapt and grow in support of those who have served. The expansion of iTRAK reflects the organization’s dedication to empowering a broader network of advocates, ultimately enhancing the services offered to veterans seeking assistance with their claims.
