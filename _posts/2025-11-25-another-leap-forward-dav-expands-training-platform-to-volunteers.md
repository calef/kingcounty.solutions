  ![](https://www.dav.org/wp-content/uploads/iTRAK_1_Featured-300x211.jpg)Representing veterans for their benefits claims has been DAV’s cornerstone for more than a century. But to remain the leader among veterans organizations, we must always look for areas to grow and evolve.

  Nowhere is that more evident than with DAV’s Interactive Training, Resource, Advocacy and Knowledge system, known as iTRAK.

  Introduced in 2016, iTRAK was more than a new piece of technology—it represented a strategic shift in how we train, support and empower those who advocate for America’s veterans. The comprehensive toolbox includes regulations and training modules, giving our national service officers the ability to sharpen their skills and broaden their knowledge.

  The influence it’s had on veterans’ claims cannot be overstated. The platform brings together Title 38 regulations; past decisions from the Board of Veterans’ Appeals; and an immersive, interactive model that helps illustrate the life-changing effects of their disabilities. Put simply, iTRAK has raised the bar for what’s possible within veteran advocacy.

  DAV’s mission has never been static, which is why we’re continually updating iTRAK to keep pace with new information.

  And now, we’re expanding access beyond our national service officers to include our volunteer chapter and department service officers. These individuals are certified volunteers who make it their mission to help veterans and families navigate the complex process of filing for veterans benefits. They are often the first contact veterans make when interacting with DAV. By ensuring all necessary information and forms are properly filled out, they give our national service officers more time to secure the benefits veterans have already earned.

  By equipping them with iTRAK, they’ll have the same cutting-edge resources that have strengthened our professional benefits advocates.

  This is more than innovation; it represents a promise that when our people—employees and volunteers alike—are armed with the right tools, they can deliver the very best to veterans. They’ll deepen their understanding of what can be an arduous system that veterans must navigate, giving them greater confidence and effectiveness in their roles.

  Nine years ago, we launched iTRAK—a leap forward in our ability to advocate and serve. Today, we’re expanding the platform to chapter and department service officers—another leap that extends our reach and ensures every veteran who turns to DAV finds an advocate ready for the task.

  When it comes to serving those who served us all, staying on the right track means continuing to evolve.

DAV is expanding its Interactive Training, Resource, Advocacy and Knowledge system (iTRAK) to include volunteer chapter and department service officers, enhancing their capacity to assist veterans in navigating the benefits claims process. Since its introduction in 2016, iTRAK has provided national service officers with essential training and resources, incorporating Title 38 regulations and past Board of Veterans’ Appeals decisions. This system has significantly improved advocacy for veterans by equipping advocates with the necessary tools to understand and address the complexities of the benefits system. By extending access to volunteers, DAV aims to ensure that all advocates, whether employees or volunteers, are well-prepared to support veterans effectively. This initiative is seen as a vital step in evolving DAV’s mission to provide the best possible service to veterans and their families, reinforcing the organization’s commitment to adapt and grow in support of those who have served. The expansion of iTRAK reflects the organization’s dedication to empowering a broader network of advocates, ultimately enhancing the services offered to veterans seeking assistance with their claims.
