As Veterans Day approaches, Metro recognizes the service of its military members, both past and present. A ceremonial flag raising took place on November 10 to honor veterans and their families. The article highlights the stories of four Metro employees who are veterans: Nicholas Warren, Ruy Diaz, Scott Peterson, and William Herbert. 

Nicholas Warren, a former U.S. Marine Corps electrician, values the discipline and leadership skills he gained, which he applies at Metro. Ruy Diaz, a 22-year U.S. Army veteran, leads asset management initiatives and emphasizes teamwork and accountability learned during his service. Scott Peterson, formerly a paratrooper and communications specialist in the U.S. Army, discovered a passion for technology and highlights the importance of organization and teamwork in his role as an IT Project Manager. Lastly, William Herbert served in both the Navy and Air Force, cherishing the bonds formed in service and now contributes to Metro's mission of community connection. 

Metro expresses gratitude to all veterans and encourages support for veteran initiatives within the community.
