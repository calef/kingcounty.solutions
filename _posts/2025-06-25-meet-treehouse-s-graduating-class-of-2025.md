  This year, Treehouse is celebrating more than 140 students in foster care as they graduate from high school, attain their GED, or complete apprenticeships!&nbsp;&nbsp;

  When youth who’ve experienced foster care make academic progress, it empowers and helps them achieve long-term stability and independence. That’s why education is key to Treehouse’s mission and why our [Graduation Success program](https://www.treehouseforkids.org/our-services/graduation-success/) focuses on one-on-one support.&nbsp;

  Now, we’re turning the mic over to some Class of 2025 graduates to share what getting their diploma means to them and hear about their future plans.&nbsp;&nbsp;
