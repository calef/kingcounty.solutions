  The City of Bellevue has selected BRIDGE Housing and Su Development to build multifamily housing complexes with affordable housing and amenities for artists on two separate city-owned properties in the BelRed Arts District.&nbsp;

  Both transit-oriented developments, next to the BelRed light rail station, will advance multiple city goals related to housing and economic development, in alignment with Bellevue’s Affordable Housing Strategy.

  “This marks a significant opportunity for the City of Bellevue, in both housing development and support of the arts and cultural ecosystem,” said Bianca Siegl, director of the city’s Office of Housing. “We look forward to continuing to expand housing opportunities for all to support thriving people and communities.”

  In July, the city solicited teams to design and construct housing, retail and community-oriented spaces on the two sites on 130th Avenue Northeast. BRIDGE Housing will develop the site at 1500 130th Ave. NE, while Su Development will develop the site at 1700 130th Ave. NE.&nbsp;

  The city is in the process of negotiating final agreements with both developers.

  - BRIDGE Housing will transform the now vacant 1.15-acre parcel in the 1500 block of 130th into an affordable housing community complete with integrated arts and cultural space. Supporting Bellevue’s goal of creating or preserving 5,700 affordable housing units over the next 10 years, the project will deliver at least 172 affordable homes, including family-sized units for households at or below 80% of the area median income.

The city of Bellevue has chosen BRIDGE Housing and Su Development to create multifamily housing complexes in the BelRed Arts District, focusing on affordable housing and artist amenities. These transit-oriented developments, located near the BelRed light rail station, support Bellevue’s Affordable Housing Strategy and broader goals for housing and economic development. BRIDGE Housing will develop a 1.15-acre site into an affordable community with at least 172 homes for families earning below 80% of the area median income, incorporating arts and cultural spaces. Su Development will convert a park-and-ride lot into a complex featuring a 302-stall parking garage, a mix of market-rate and affordable housing, and a ground-floor arts hub with retail spaces for artists and a public arts plaza. The developments aim to enhance the BelRed Arts District, which is home to more than 100 creative businesses, fostering a vibrant community that promotes living, working, and cultural engagement. The BelRed Arts District Community Alliance has played a vital role in realizing this vision, contributing to the area's transformation into a hub of connectivity and creativity.
