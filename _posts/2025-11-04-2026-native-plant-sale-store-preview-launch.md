The King Conservation District (KCD) has announced its 2026 Native Plant Sale. The sale offers a range of native trees, shrubs, and groundcovers suitable for conservation projects and home gardens. The plants are mostly bareroot stock, harvested in winter when dormant and ready for replanting. The sale operates on a pre-order/pre-purchase basis, with no walk-up sales available. The KCD has also introduced rolling pickups for customers who have been notified their orders are ready. The pickup location is the Tukwila Community Center. Customers are urged to order early due to high demand.
