  When&nbsp;Tonia&nbsp;Bartz was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia in 2021, everything changed overnight. **“I went to the ER knowing something was off, but I never imagined&nbsp;it would be cancer or that&nbsp;I’d be admitted immediately for chemotherapy,” she recalls.**

  Her journey included chemo, radiation, a stem cell transplant, and a donor lymphocyte infusion. As she approaches three years of remission,&nbsp;Tonia&nbsp;reflects on how healing continued long after treatment ended. **“Life after cancer&nbsp;is&nbsp;so different,” she says. “I wish I’d known how deeply those changes would matter—big ones like shifting my career, but also the unexpected&nbsp;losses, like missing my hair or rethinking my identity.”** With a background in holistic wellness,&nbsp;Tonia&nbsp;leaned on mindfulness and compassion to navigate the “messy middle” of recovery. “Healing isn’t linear—it can last a lifetime,” she says. **“Seeking support isn’t weakness—it’s wisdom.”**

  That wisdom led her to Cancer Lifeline. “I was looking for a support group and found so much more,” she shares. “Cancer Lifeline became a space where I could show up as I was, ask questions without judgment, and connect with others who truly understand.”

  Her support group became a lifeline in every sense—friends who listen, share, and hold space for honesty and hope. **“There’s something irreplaceable about shared experience,” she says. “It creates permission to be real.”** From sound baths to therapy horses,&nbsp;Tonia&nbsp;found that Cancer Lifeline’s programs seem to “intuitively meet people where they are.” **Now she gives back by facilitating classes herself, helping others find what she found: a community that heals together, one day at a time.**
