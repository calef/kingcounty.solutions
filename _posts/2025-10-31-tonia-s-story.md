Tonia Bartz was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia in 2021, which drastically changed her life. After being admitted to the hospital for chemotherapy, her treatment journey included additional procedures like radiation and a stem cell transplant. As she nears three years of remission, Tonia reflects on the profound changes in her life post-cancer, including a career shift and the emotional impact of losing her hair and redefining her identity. Utilizing her background in holistic wellness, she embraced mindfulness and compassion during her recovery, acknowledging that healing is not linear and can last a lifetime. Seeking support became essential for her, leading her to Cancer Lifeline, where she found a community that offered understanding and acceptance. The support group provided her with friendships, shared experiences, and a safe space to express her feelings. Tonia appreciates the various programs offered by Cancer Lifeline, such as sound baths and therapy with horses, which cater to individual needs. Now, she contributes by facilitating classes for others, fostering a sense of community that promotes healing together, one day at a time.
