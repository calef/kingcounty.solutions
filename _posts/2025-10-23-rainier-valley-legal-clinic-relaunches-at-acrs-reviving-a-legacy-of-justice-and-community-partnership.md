The Rainier Valley Legal Clinic has relaunched at the Asian Counseling and Referral Service (ACRS), marking an important milestone in community justice. On its opening night, volunteer attorneys from the Asian Bar Association of Washington and King County Bar Association provided free legal advice on housing, family, and consumer issues to clients in South Seattle. This clinic revives ACRS's long-standing commitment to ensuring equal access to justice, a legacy initiated by volunteer attorney John Chen Beckwith decades ago. ACRS emphasizes that access to justice should not depend on income, immigration status, or language ability. The clinic, which had been on hold during the COVID-19 pandemic, aims to serve diverse immigrant and refugee communities in the area. Operated under the KCBA Neighborhood Legal Clinics program, the clinic offers 30–60 minute consultations by appointment. While it does not handle immigration cases directly, it provides referrals to trusted resources. Future clinics will be held on the third Wednesday of each month. Interpretation services are available in multiple languages, reinforcing the clinic's commitment to culturally responsive assistance. Volunteers, including attorneys and law students, are encouraged to participate.
