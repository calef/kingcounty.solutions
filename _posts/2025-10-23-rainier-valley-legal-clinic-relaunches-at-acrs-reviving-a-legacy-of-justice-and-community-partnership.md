  <p data-start="541" data-end="1247"><strong data-start="541" data-end="571">SEATTLE — October 22, 2025</strong> — The return of the <strong data-start="592" data-end="623">Rainier Valley Legal Clinic</strong> at Asian Counseling and Referral Service (ACRS) quietly marked a powerful milestone in community justice. On its opening night, three volunteer attorneys from the <strong data-start="787" data-end="833">Asian Bar Association of Washington (ABAW)</strong> and <strong data-start="838" data-end="876">King County Bar Association (KCBA)</strong> met one-on-one with clients seeking free legal advice — from housing and family issues to consumer concerns — in private rooms at ACRS’s main office.

  <p data-start="1285" data-end="1716">The relaunch marks the revival of one of ACRS’s earliest initiatives for equal access to justice — a legacy that began decades ago when volunteer attorney John Chen Beckwith helped the organization provide pro bono legal assistance to Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (A&amp;NH/PI) and other communities in South Seattle. Today’s clinic builds on that foundation, continuing the spirit of community advocacy that has long been part of ACRS’s DNA.</p>
  <p data-start="1718" data-end="2065">“This is a full-circle moment for us,” said G De Castro, ACRS Deputy Director. “Access to justice should never depend on income, immigration status, or language ability. This clinic brings that belief to life by connecting clients with volunteer attorneys who not only understand the law but also the lived experiences of the people we serve.”</p>
  <p data-start="2115" data-end="2561">The clinic had been on pause since the COVID-19 pandemic, when in-person legal services were suspended for health and safety reasons. Its return represents a renewed commitment to serving the diverse communities in South Seattle, many of whom are immigrant and refugee families.</p>
  <p>&#8220;Our very first pro bono attorney, John Chen Beckwith, helped build this foundation decades ago. Bringing this clinic back reminds us &#8211; and everyone watching &#8211; that no matter what obstacles come our way, we will meet the need,&#8221; said ACRS CEO Kendee Yamaguchi.</p>

  **SEATTLE — October 22, 2025** — The return of the **Rainier Valley Legal Clinic** at Asian Counseling and Referral Service (ACRS) quietly marked a powerful milestone in community justice. On its opening night, three volunteer attorneys from the **Asian Bar Association of Washington (ABAW)** and **King County Bar Association (KCBA)** met one-on-one with clients seeking free legal advice — from housing and family issues to consumer concerns — in private rooms at ACRS’s main office. Joined by ACRS CEO **Kendee Yamaguchi** and Deputy Director **G De Castro** , the evening reflected the heart of the clinic’s mission: restoring access to justice through compassion, expertise, and cultural understanding.

  The relaunch marks the revival of one of ACRS’s earliest initiatives for equal access to justice — a legacy that began decades ago when volunteer attorney John Chen Beckwith helped the organization provide pro bono legal assistance to Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (A&NH/PI) and other communities in South Seattle. Today’s clinic builds on that foundation, continuing the spirit of community advocacy that has long been part of ACRS’s DNA.

  “This is a full-circle moment for us,” said G De Castro, ACRS Deputy Director. “Access to justice should never depend on income, immigration status, or language ability. This clinic brings that belief to life by connecting clients with volunteer attorneys who not only understand the law but also the lived experiences of the people we serve.”

  The clinic had been on pause since the COVID-19 pandemic, when in-person legal services were suspended for health and safety reasons. Its return represents a renewed commitment to serving the diverse communities in South Seattle, many of whom are immigrant and refugee families.

  “Our very first pro bono attorney, John Chen Beckwith, helped build this foundation decades ago. Bringing this clinic back reminds us – and everyone watching – that no matter what obstacles come our way, we will meet the need,”&nbsp;said ACRS CEO Kendee Yamaguchi.

  ### How the Clinic Works

  The **Rainier Valley Legal Clinic** operates as part of the **KCBA Neighborhood Legal Clinics (NLC) program**, which offers free, limited legal advice and referrals to King County residents. Volunteer attorneys meet with clients by appointment for 30–60 minute consultations to help identify legal issues, explain possible options, and connect them with resources or referrals for ongoing support.

  While the clinic does not handle immigration cases directly, clients in need of immigration-related legal help are referred to trusted community resources and outside attorneys. Interpretation is available in multiple languages through ACRS’s on-demand language service, ensuring that clients receive accurate and culturally responsive assistance.

  ### A Collaboration Rooted in Community

  Volunteer attorneys from ABAW, KCBA, and the broader legal community will staff the clinic, with coordination led by ABAW. Each monthly session includes two to three attorneys, and partners are exploring opportunities for law students to participate in future operations.

The Rainier Valley Legal Clinic has relaunched at the Asian Counseling and Referral Service (ACRS), marking an important milestone in community justice. On its opening night, volunteer attorneys from the Asian Bar Association of Washington and King County Bar Association provided free legal advice on housing, family, and consumer issues to clients in South Seattle. This clinic revives ACRS's long-standing commitment to ensuring equal access to justice, a legacy initiated by volunteer attorney John Chen Beckwith decades ago. ACRS emphasizes that access to justice should not depend on income, immigration status, or language ability. The clinic, which had been on hold during the COVID-19 pandemic, aims to serve diverse immigrant and refugee communities in the area. Operated under the KCBA Neighborhood Legal Clinics program, the clinic offers 30–60 minute consultations by appointment. While it does not handle immigration cases directly, it provides referrals to trusted resources. Future clinics will be held on the third Wednesday of each month. Interpretation services are available in multiple languages, reinforcing the clinic's commitment to culturally responsive assistance. Volunteers, including attorneys and law students, are encouraged to participate.
