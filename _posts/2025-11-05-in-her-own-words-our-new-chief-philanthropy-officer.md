Anna Cronin, the new Chief Philanthropy Officer at United Way of King County, reflects on her upbringing in Seattle, where her parents' activism instilled values of equity and community service. Her diverse educational experiences highlighted the importance of racial equity, shaping her nearly two-decade career in nonprofits. Cronin has worked across various organizational sizes, focusing on supporting marginalized communities. She emphasizes the current challenges facing the safety net in Washington, particularly as nearly a million residents risk losing SNAP benefits, with children significantly affected. While she believes that government should primarily sustain this safety net, she acknowledges that philanthropy currently plays a critical role in addressing immediate needs as funding is cut and policies change. Cronin expresses her commitment to fostering partnerships with donors and organizations to create a better world, calling for generosity and collaboration during this challenging time. She is excited to embark on her journey with United Way of King County, confident in the community's ability to support those in need.
