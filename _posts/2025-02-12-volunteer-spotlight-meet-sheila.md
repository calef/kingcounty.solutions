  For February, we want to highlight Sheila who has, in such a short time, been an integral part of HIP Packs! Through purposefully placed brochures, Sheila found HIP while volunteering with Lifetime Learning Center, (who share the same building with!), a non-profit offering classes and workshops to older adults, teaching classes. Currently retired, Sheila has experience volunteering with various organizations including YWCA Food Bank, soup kitchens, shelters, and schools. Volunteering, she explains, brings her joy, peace, and a time for reflection.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  Her perception of&nbsp;volunteering is deeply rooted in the idea of giving back. She explains: “It allows me to give back to the community in which I live in small ways and brings me closer to those who struggle every day to put food on the table and to pay their bills. I feel strongly that it is my responsibility, as a person to whom so much has been given, to offer my time and effort to serve others in ways that extend beyond writing a check.” Although she mentions feeling inspired by the work we do at HIP, we’re in awe of her dedication&nbsp;to her community and values.

  Although Sheila has volunteered with HIP’s various programs including Shelter and&nbsp;Senior Meals, she was&nbsp;particularly drawn to HIP Packs. “Children, she explains, have always been dear to my heart and I&nbsp;find&nbsp;fulfillment in being able to work with a program that helps provide food and nourishment for needy children”.&nbsp;Those feelings of endearment are evident in the picture above, which shows Sheila with her granddaughter.

For February, Sheila is highlighted as a key volunteer at HIP Packs. She discovered HIP through brochures while volunteering at the Lifetime Learning Center, which offers classes to older adults. Retired, Sheila has a rich history of volunteering with organizations such as the YWCA Food Bank and various shelters and schools. She finds joy and reflection in her volunteer work, viewing it as a way to give back to her community and support those facing food insecurity. Sheila believes it is her responsibility to serve others beyond financial contributions.

Though she has participated in multiple HIP programs, she is particularly passionate about HIP Packs, expressing a deep affection for children and the fulfillment she gets from providing food to those in need. Despite joining HIP just a couple of months ago, her contributions have been significant, especially in assembling and organizing HIP packs. Sheila's dedication and multifaceted experience are greatly valued by the organization, and her impact is already evident.
