For February, Sheila is highlighted as a key volunteer at HIP Packs. She discovered HIP through brochures while volunteering at the Lifetime Learning Center, which offers classes to older adults. Retired, Sheila has a rich history of volunteering with organizations such as the YWCA Food Bank and various shelters and schools. She finds joy and reflection in her volunteer work, viewing it as a way to give back to her community and support those facing food insecurity. Sheila believes it is her responsibility to serve others beyond financial contributions.

Though she has participated in multiple HIP programs, she is particularly passionate about HIP Packs, expressing a deep affection for children and the fulfillment she gets from providing food to those in need. Despite joining HIP just a couple of months ago, her contributions have been significant, especially in assembling and organizing HIP packs. Sheila's dedication and multifaceted experience are greatly valued by the organization, and her impact is already evident.
