Little Saigon has been identified as the most crime-ridden area in King County, plagued by criminal activities, open-air drug use, and drug trafficking. In response, a coalition including the International District Rotary and LIHI has proposed a comprehensive 15-Point Plan to enhance public safety in the neighborhood, unveiled at a press conference on September 16. Key recommendations include establishing a Community Safety and Service Office, increasing police patrols, enforcing laws against illegal activities, adding tiny house villages for the homeless, and boosting funding for affordable housing. The plan also calls for financial support for small businesses affected by crime. Public officials, including King County Councilmember Claudia Balducci and Seattle City Council President Sara Nelson, expressed their support, emphasizing the urgent need for immediate action to restore safety and community well-being. The plan aims to transform Little Saigon into a thriving, culturally rich area where residents and visitors can feel safe, addressing both the criminal activities and the underlying issues contributing to the neighborhood's decline.
