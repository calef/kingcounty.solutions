A delegation of 17 high school students and three teachers from Thonon Les Bains, France, is visiting Mercer Island for a 10-day cultural exchange, celebrating the 25th anniversary of their sister city relationship. The students will stay with host families, tour local attractions, and attend classes at Mercer Island High School. The visit began with a Halloween-themed reception attended by local officials. Students are excited to experience American culture and improve their English. This exchange fosters friendships and cultural understanding, highlighting the ongoing partnership between the two cities formed in 2000.
