Preventing bicycles from entering the waste stream is viewed as common sense rather than merely environmentalism. The Recycle & Reuse department at Bike Works has been recognized with a Green Globe award from King County Natural Resources and Parks for their efforts in this area, processing over 5,000 bicycles in 2024. However, this effort is small compared to the global bicycle industry, which produces 55,000 bikes daily. Major bicycle companies prioritize minor enhancements in performance and weight, transforming bicycles from durable machines into disposable commodities. The article questions the longevity of modern bikes, especially eBikes, and emphasizes the challenges in maintaining complex systems over time. 

In contrast, the concept of the "forever bike" is promoted, which consists of analog, mechanical systems designed for longevity and ease of repair. The Recycle & Reuse team and associated organizations advocate for this approach. They host community events like Dirty Bike Parties and Volunteer Repair Parties, encouraging public participation in bike maintenance and repair, and accept donations to support their efforts in fostering a sustainable bicycle culture.
