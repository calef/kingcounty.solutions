KCSARC reaffirms its commitment to serving all survivors of sexual assault, particularly those from marginalized communities, following a decision by a national organization to limit resource referrals. Acknowledging that these communities face higher risks of sexual assault and often struggle to receive support, KCSARC emphasizes its dedication to providing non-judgmental assistance. The organization aims to empower survivors and their families by offering essential information and connections to relevant services tailored to individual needs. KCSARC recognizes that each survivor's experience is unique and strives to ensure that everyone has access to the resources necessary for recovery and safety.
