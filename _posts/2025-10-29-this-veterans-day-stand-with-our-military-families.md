  <p>SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS &#8211; As Veterans Day approaches, Operation Homefront is issuing a powerful call to action: military and veteran families are in crisis, and now is the time for Americans to step up and show their support.</p>



  <p>Rising inflation, economic uncertainty, and the recent government shutdown have placed immense strain on these families, especially those that are junior enlisted. Operation Homefront has seen a <strong>39% increase</strong> in Critical Financial Assistance requests and a 57% year-over-year surge in food assistance needs.</p>



  <p>In response, the nonprofit is launching a Veterans Day campaign (November 1-12) aiming to raise $850,000 to provide the resources and support that will help military and veteran families stay in their homes, keep the lights on, and put food on the table.</p>



  <p>“These families have served and sacrificed for us. Now, it’s our turn,” says retired Rear Adm. Alan Reyes, President and CEO of Operation Homefront. “Let’s ensure those who protect our freedom never face hardship alone.”</p>



  <p>Throughout the campaign, Operation Homefront will share real stories from the families and caseworkers that are confronting these challenges head-on. The organization will also recognize the critical support of its generous corporate partners making this work possible, including CarMax, Hilton Grand Vacations, The Home Depot Foundation, Impossible Foods, Love’s Travel Stops, Meritage Homes, Northrop Grumman, and PulteGroup, Inc.</p>



  <p>Operation Homefront challenges all Americans to stand by struggling military families by donating to their Veterans Day campaign, sharing it on social media, and encouraging others to get involved.</p>



  <p>Together, we can give our military and veteran families what they deserve: relief, stability, and gratitude.</p>

As Veterans Day approaches, Operation Homefront is calling for support for military and veteran families facing significant challenges due to rising inflation, economic uncertainty, and the recent government shutdown. The nonprofit reports a 39% increase in requests for Critical Financial Assistance and a 57% rise in food assistance needs. To address these issues, Operation Homefront is launching a campaign from November 1-12, aiming to raise $850,000 to help families maintain their homes and provide essential resources. Retired Rear Adm. Alan Reyes, President and CEO, emphasizes the importance of supporting these families who have served the nation. The campaign will highlight personal stories from affected families and acknowledge corporate partners like CarMax and The Home Depot Foundation, who contribute to its mission. Operation Homefront encourages all Americans to participate by donating, sharing the campaign on social media, and advocating for military families. The organization is dedicated to building stable, secure lives for military and veteran families through financial assistance and support services, ensuring they do not face hardship alone.
