As Veterans Day approaches, Operation Homefront is calling for support for military and veteran families facing significant challenges due to rising inflation, economic uncertainty, and the recent government shutdown. The nonprofit reports a 39% increase in requests for Critical Financial Assistance and a 57% rise in food assistance needs. To address these issues, Operation Homefront is launching a campaign from November 1-12, aiming to raise $850,000 to help families maintain their homes and provide essential resources. Retired Rear Adm. Alan Reyes, President and CEO, emphasizes the importance of supporting these families who have served the nation. The campaign will highlight personal stories from affected families and acknowledge corporate partners like CarMax and The Home Depot Foundation, who contribute to its mission. Operation Homefront encourages all Americans to participate by donating, sharing the campaign on social media, and advocating for military families. The organization is dedicated to building stable, secure lives for military and veteran families through financial assistance and support services, ensuring they do not face hardship alone.
