  <p>Today, Michelle and Brent have a warm apartment to call home where&nbsp;their&nbsp;9-month-old son&nbsp;has space to play and explore.&nbsp;But less than two years ago,&nbsp;the couple was living unsheltered,&nbsp;battling&nbsp;substance use&nbsp;disorder, and uncertain about their future.&nbsp;Through&nbsp;determination&nbsp;and&nbsp;commitment, they have&nbsp;created&nbsp;stability and security&nbsp;for themselves and their growing family.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>“We’re&nbsp;both doing&nbsp;really well.&nbsp;If it&nbsp;wasn’t&nbsp;for the help from&nbsp;Catholic Community Services,&nbsp;we&nbsp;wouldn’t&nbsp;be where&nbsp;we’re&nbsp;at today,” Michelle shares.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>When the couple learned that Michelle was pregnant,&nbsp;they were&nbsp;determined to give their child a safe and healthy start.&nbsp;They&nbsp;committed to treatment, achieved sobriety, and began to search for stable housing. They moved in with Brent’s brother, but a few weeks after their son was born, the landlord lost ownership of the property.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>Now with a newborn, Michelle and Brent were once again facing homelessness. They moved into a shelter, where they connected with Catholic Community Services’ (CCS)&nbsp;<a href="https://ccsww.org/services/family-housing-network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Family Housing Network</a>&nbsp;which helps families experiencing homelessness in&nbsp;Pierce County&nbsp;find permanent housing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p>“When I found out we were going to get&nbsp;help,&nbsp;it was a huge weight lifted off my shoulders,” Brent says.&nbsp;</p>



  <h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Effective Solutions for Homelessness</strong> </h3>



  <p>The Family Housing Network team worked with Michelle and Brent to chart a&nbsp;route&nbsp;to stability. The&nbsp;team&nbsp;connected the couple with a landlord willing to work with families in crisis and covered move-in costs,&nbsp;helping&nbsp;the family find a place to call home after&nbsp;years of&nbsp;instability.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p>“We&nbsp;wouldn&#8217;t&nbsp;have been able to afford that. We would have been homeless with a newborn,” Michelle says.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>This approach to addressing homelessness is referred to as rapid rehousing and entails short-term case management and financial&nbsp;assistance&nbsp;that helps people experiencing homelessness quickly transition to permanent housing.&nbsp;<a href="https://nlihc.org/resource/report-finds-rapid-re-housing-effective-low-cost-intervention-homelessness" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Research</a>&nbsp;has&nbsp;shown rapid rehousing to be an effective and&nbsp;cost-efficient&nbsp;tool for addressing homelessness, with 70% of program participants finding permanent housing.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>“It’s&nbsp;a&nbsp;really cool&nbsp;program to give people second chances.&nbsp;It’s&nbsp;really hard&nbsp;to get a second chance, and I&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;know where we would be today without the help,” Brent says.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Alongside the Rapid Rehousing program, the Family Housing Network offers&nbsp;an array of other programs and services to support families experiencing homelessness in Pierce County, including case management, day shelter,&nbsp;referral&nbsp;to permanent supportive housing, veterans’&nbsp;assistance, and more.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Across the CCS program network spanning Western Washington, programs served more than&nbsp;<a href="https://heyzine.com/flip-book/23fe66cb4b.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">14,000 people</a>&nbsp;experiencing homelessness last year with services ranging from shelter to rental&nbsp;assistance&nbsp;to case management.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A New Chapter of Hope</strong> </h3>



  <p>The stability of permanent housing gave Michelle and Brent the foundation they needed to build toward a life they had always dreamed of.&nbsp;Shortly after moving in, Michelle secured work in the health care&nbsp;industry&nbsp;with&nbsp;CCS providing work clothes so she could start strong.&nbsp;Brent&nbsp;picked up shifts through a temporary employment agency and&nbsp;began a certificate to become a&nbsp;flagger.&nbsp;Today, they have both found full-time&nbsp;work and recently transitioned&nbsp;off of&nbsp;the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, achieving a new level of&nbsp;independence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p>“Going from homelessness and trying to get into a place feels almost impossible because&nbsp;it’s&nbsp;so expensive,” Brent says. “But just having that help,&nbsp;we’re&nbsp;at a point now where&nbsp;we’re&nbsp;fully&nbsp;self-supporting.”&nbsp;</p>

  <p>With&nbsp;housing secured,&nbsp;the&nbsp;couple&nbsp;can&nbsp;focus more time and energy on&nbsp;what matters most: nurturing their family. This summer, they took a family trip and enrolled their son in&nbsp;swim&nbsp;lessons. The couple, now married, are&nbsp;joyfully preparing to welcome&nbsp;a&nbsp;second child into their family soon. After her&nbsp;pregnancy,&nbsp;Michelle plans to attend nursing school.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Through the partnership of CCS and their own unwavering dedication, Michelle and Brent have&nbsp;created stability for their young&nbsp;family&nbsp;and&nbsp;continue working&nbsp;toward a&nbsp;brighter&nbsp;future every day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p>“Now that we have stability and we’ve built that foundation, we’re&nbsp;able to do things&nbsp;we wouldn’t be able to do if we didn’t have stability,” Michelle says. “We’re&nbsp;headed in the right direction&nbsp;and making improvements.”&nbsp;</p>

Today, Michelle and Brent have a stable home for their family, including their 9-month-old son, after a challenging journey from homelessness. Less than two years ago, they faced unsheltered living and substance use disorders. Upon learning of Michelle's pregnancy, they committed to treatment and sought stable housing. Initially, they moved in with Brent's brother, but soon faced homelessness again after the landlord lost the property.

They connected with Catholic Community Services' Family Housing Network while residing in a shelter. The program provided essential support, including assistance with move-in costs and connecting them with a landlord willing to help families in crisis. This intervention allowed them to secure permanent housing, which was critical for their family’s future.

With the stability of a home, both have found employment—Michelle in healthcare and Brent through a temporary agency—and they have transitioned off nutritional assistance. They are now focused on their family, enjoying activities like swimming lessons for their son and preparing for a second child. Their story illustrates the impact of supportive services in overcoming homelessness and building a brighter future.
