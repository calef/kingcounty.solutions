Today, Michelle and Brent have a stable home for their family, including their 9-month-old son, after a challenging journey from homelessness. Less than two years ago, they faced unsheltered living and substance use disorders. Upon learning of Michelle's pregnancy, they committed to treatment and sought stable housing. Initially, they moved in with Brent's brother, but soon faced homelessness again after the landlord lost the property.

They connected with Catholic Community Services' Family Housing Network while residing in a shelter. The program provided essential support, including assistance with move-in costs and connecting them with a landlord willing to help families in crisis. This intervention allowed them to secure permanent housing, which was critical for their family’s future.

With the stability of a home, both have found employment—Michelle in healthcare and Brent through a temporary agency—and they have transitioned off nutritional assistance. They are now focused on their family, enjoying activities like swimming lessons for their son and preparing for a second child. Their story illustrates the impact of supportive services in overcoming homelessness and building a brighter future.
