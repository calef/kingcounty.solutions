  <p>CORVALLIS, Ore. — The boards of directors for the Corvallis-based Samaritan Health Services and Tacoma-based MultiCare Health System have approved an affiliation between the two organizations, marking a major milestone in advancing access to high-quality, community-based health care across Oregon and the Pacific Northwest.</p>
  <p>In the coming weeks, Samaritan and MultiCare will sign the formal affiliation agreement, paving the way for Samaritan to become part of MultiCare. The two organizations will now begin taking the next steps needed to bring the affiliation to completion, which is expected to occur in mid-2026.</p>
  <p>“This affiliation represents an important step in securing the future of nonprofit health care in our region,” said Marty Cahill, president and chief executive officer of Samaritan. “Our commitment has always been to remain a community-based, mission-driven organization, and this partnership strengthens that promise for decades to come. Together, we will expand access, invest in the technology and services our communities need, and do so while keeping care nonprofit and locally governed. We are excited and honored to become MultiCare&#8217;s first health system in Oregon and to bring the benefits of MultiCare’s expertise home to the communities we serve.”</p>
  <p>The affiliation between Samaritan and MultiCare will also further strengthen health care across the region by enhancing quality, supporting affordability and advancing health equity. As part of the agreement, MultiCare has committed to invest resources over the next 10 years to modernize Samaritan’s facilities, grow primary and specialty care, and introduce new technologies and telehealth capabilities that improve access, patient experience and help lower the cost of care. This investment also includes plans to expand Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center, adding inpatient capacity and ensuring the region’s growing population has continued access to local hospital care. The affiliation will also bring MultiCare’s leading behavioral health network — the largest in Washington — into Samaritan’s service area, increasing access across the mid-Willamette Valley and central coast.</p>
  <p>“MultiCare’s mission is partnering for healing and a healthy future, and that mission drives us to seek out like-minded organizations to ensure Pacific Northwest communities have long-term access to local care,” said MultiCare CEO Bill Robertson. “MultiCare and Samaritan are closely aligned in our mission, vision and values, making us ideal partners as we strengthen our networks across our service regions. It will be our privilege to be a part of the communities Samaritan serves and we look forward to working together to support and advance health care in Oregon.”</p>
  <p>For now, nothing changes for patients, employees or health plan members. Samaritan will continue to operate as it does today, providing care through the same trusted clinicians and facilities, while both organizations complete the remaining steps in the affiliation process.</p>
  <p>Samaritan will remain locally governed and community based, maintaining its deep roots in the region while gaining access to new resources, expertise and operational strength through MultiCare. Once finalized, the affiliation will bring expanded services, modernized capabilities and greater long-term stability to the communities Samaritan serves.</p>

The boards of directors for Samaritan Health Services in Corvallis, Oregon, and MultiCare Health System in Tacoma, Washington, have approved an affiliation aimed at enhancing community-based healthcare across the Pacific Northwest. This affiliation, expected to be finalized by mid-2026, will allow Samaritan to integrate with MultiCare, reinforcing their commitment to nonprofit, community-driven care. MultiCare plans to invest significantly over the next decade to modernize Samaritan’s facilities, expand primary and specialty care, and enhance technology, including telehealth services. This collaboration is intended to improve healthcare quality, affordability, and equity in the region. The affiliation will also introduce MultiCare's extensive behavioral health network to Samaritan's service area, increasing access to mental health resources. Despite the changes, Samaritan will continue to operate independently for now, maintaining its local governance and community focus. Once the affiliation is complete, it will provide expanded services and greater stability for the communities served by Samaritan.
