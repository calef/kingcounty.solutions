  <p>Dementia is an umbrella term covering a wide variety of conditions affecting the brain that typically get worse over time.

Karin Taifour, a licensed clinical social worker and geriatric mental health specialist, explains the various types of dementia in a recent session. Dementia is an umbrella term for a range of cognitive impairments that interfere with daily life, and it encompasses several different forms, each with distinct characteristics. Alzheimer's disease is the most common type, marked by memory loss and confusion. Vascular dementia, resulting from reduced blood flow to the brain, often follows a stroke and can lead to varying symptoms based on the affected brain regions. Lewy body dementia features fluctuations in attention and visual hallucinations, while frontotemporal dementia primarily affects personality and behavior. Taifour emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and intervention, which can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Family members play a crucial role in supporting those with dementia, as understanding the specific type can aid in communication and care strategies. Taifour encourages open conversations about cognitive health and recommends resources for families navigating the complexities of dementia care.
