This week, King County Solutions published four important posts, focusing on resources for older adults and mental health awareness. These updates are particularly relevant as we continue to address the needs of our community, especially during September, which is recognized for both Falls Prevention Awareness and Suicide Prevention Month.

### Support for Older Adults
In our ongoing efforts to enhance the well-being of older adults, the [CLC Newsletter – September to October 2025](https://cisc-seattle.org/clc-newsletter-september-to-october-2025/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=clc-newsletter-september-to-october-2025) from the Chinese Information & Service Center (CISC) is now available. This newsletter provides valuable information and resources tailored for older adults in King County, helping them stay connected and informed.

Additionally, the [Stay Steady, Stay Independent](https://snoqualmievalleyhealth.org/stay-steady-stay-independent/) initiative by Hospital District No. 4 (Snoqualmie Valley Hospital) highlights the critical issue of fall prevention. With one in four adults over 65 experiencing falls annually, this program offers free educational materials and assessments to help reduce risks associated with falls. The upcoming balance and hearing assessments at the Sno-Valley Senior Center on September 24 are particularly noteworthy.

### Mental Health Awareness
September also marks Suicide Prevention Month, and Hospital District No. 4 has shared essential insights in their post, [Suicide Prevention Month: Warning Signs, Resources & How to Help](https://snoqualmievalleyhealth.org/suicide-prevention-month-2/). This resource emphasizes recognizing warning signs of suicidal thoughts and encourages open conversations about mental health. With suicide being the 11th leading cause of death in the U.S., the availability of resources like the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline is crucial for community support.

Moreover, Encompass NW has organized a [Confidence Camp: Back-to-School Edition](https://encompassnw.org/confidence-camp-back-to-school-edition/) aimed at helping children build emotional resilience as they transition back to school. This camp, featuring 19 therapists, equips children with skills to express emotions and cope with challenges, fostering a supportive environment for mental health.

### Other updates
There are no additional updates to report this week. 

These initiatives reflect our commitment to fostering a supportive community for all residents, particularly our older adults and youth, during these critical awareness months.

We’ll continue to pull the most actionable updates from partner feeds each week. Let us know if there’s a topic you’d like covered in more depth.
