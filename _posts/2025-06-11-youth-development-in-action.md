As the school year ends, the Youth Development team celebrated with students from Foster High School’s Peer Mediation program, reflecting on their growth and connections. The event featured an activity called The Web, where students tossed yarn while sharing appreciation for one another, symbolizing their interconnectedness. Sharon, a Restorative Practices Liaison, emphasized the impact of their connections. Students also created value bracelets, discussing personal values that resonated with them, highlighting the program's focus on self-awareness and emotional growth. A standout student, Camila, known for her empathy and leadership, exemplified the program's success in fostering youth leadership. The team, led by Youth Development Program Manager Fergie, is committed to enhancing emotional intelligence and regulation skills, viewing them as crucial for prevention of various societal issues. As the Peer Mediation program concludes, the team is eager to explore new opportunities for youth leadership and community engagement. At Showalter, over 40 mediations were conducted, showcasing students' growing confidence and skills. The program relies on community support and funding, expressing gratitude to the Tukwila School District, school staff, parents, and facilitators for their essential contributions. The commitment to nurturing values-driven youth leadership remains strong.
