  <p>As the school year draws to a close, the Youth Development team gathered with students from <a href="https://fosterhs.lcisd.org/">Foster High School</a>&#8216;s Peer Mediation programs to reflect, celebrate, and express gratitude for the growth and connections made over the past year.</p>
  <p>To mark the end of the program, students participated in an activity called <em>The Web</em>, where they stood in a circle and tossed a ball of yarn to one another, each time sharing something they appreciated about the next person. By the end, a physical web of yarn symbolized the deep interconnection within the group. Sharon, our Restorative Practices Liaison, shared, <strong><em>“You can pull on this web, and whatever you do affects anyone else who’s attached to it.”</em></strong></p>
  <p>The celebration continued with value bracelets, where each student selected a personal value and shared why it resonated with them. These moments were not only meaningful, but also a testament to the program’s emphasis on self-awareness, community, and emotional growth.</p>

  <p>A standout student, Camila, or “Caring Camila,” as she’s known in the group, embodied the program’s spirit. As a student lead, she initiated sessions, communicated across the group, and exemplified what it means to lead with empathy. Her growth throughout the year reflected what’s possible when students are given the tools and trust to step into leadership roles.</p>
  <h4></h4>
  <h4>Emotional Intelligence</h4>
  <p>This year’s work extended beyond individual skill-building. As Fergie, Youth Development Program Manager shared, the team is deeply committed to expanding emotional intelligence practices, particularly emotional regulation. That theme resonated strongly across the program. In reflecting on the importance of this work, Fergie shared a quote that had a lasting impact on her:</p>
  <p><strong>“Teaching people how to regulate their emotions is crime prevention. It&#8217;s addiction prevention. It&#8217;s suicide prevention. It&#8217;s generational healing… Emotional regulation is not just a soft skill. It&#8217;s survival.”<br />
  &#8211; <em>Warpaint Journal</em></strong></p>
  <p>This vision is shaping what’s next. While the Peer Mediation program at Foster High School has concluded, the team is already working to build on this momentum. They are exploring future programming opportunities that center youth leadership and community engagement.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, the team at <a href="https://showalter.tukwilaschools.org/">Showalter</a> saw remarkable progress as well. Over 40 mediations were conducted, and students gained confidence and fluency in co-mediating, communicating seamlessly, and leading sessions with clarity and compassion. Their continued energy and self-led recruitment efforts speak volumes.</p>

As the school year ends, the Youth Development team celebrated with students from Foster High School’s Peer Mediation program, reflecting on their growth and connections. The event featured an activity called The Web, where students tossed yarn while sharing appreciation for one another, symbolizing their interconnectedness. Sharon, a Restorative Practices Liaison, emphasized the impact of their connections. Students also created value bracelets, discussing personal values that resonated with them, highlighting the program's focus on self-awareness and emotional growth. A standout student, Camila, known for her empathy and leadership, exemplified the program's success in fostering youth leadership. The team, led by Youth Development Program Manager Fergie, is committed to enhancing emotional intelligence and regulation skills, viewing them as crucial for prevention of various societal issues. As the Peer Mediation program concludes, the team is eager to explore new opportunities for youth leadership and community engagement. At Showalter, over 40 mediations were conducted, showcasing students' growing confidence and skills. The program relies on community support and funding, expressing gratitude to the Tukwila School District, school staff, parents, and facilitators for their essential contributions. The commitment to nurturing values-driven youth leadership remains strong.
