The King County Flood Control District (KCFCD) has approved a $114.1 million budget for 2026, maintaining the levy rate at $0.11 per $1,000 of assessed property value. The budget emphasizes strong fiscal responsibility and aligns flood reduction priorities with climate resilience and community engagement. Key initiatives include implementing capital projects, updating the strategic plan, and enhancing flood preparedness. The Advisory Committee's recommendations will guide resource allocation towards areas with the highest flood risk. The budget serves as a roadmap for resilience, focusing on protecting communities, restoring ecosystems, and promoting equity and sustainable livelihoods.
