  <h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Continuing a Strong Record of Fiscal Responsibility</h2>



  <p>The 2026 budget reflects both fiscal discipline and community responsiveness. The <strong>levy rate remains unchanged</strong>, continuing at $0.11 per $1,000 of assessed property value. This stable rate ensures residents and businesses can rely on consistent funding for critical flood risk reduction projects without an increase in the tax burden.</p>
