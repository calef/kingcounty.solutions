  VRFA is excited to once again be hosting Scout Night at the Fire Station. Please join us on Wednesday, October 29th from 5:30 -8:30 PM at Station 33 in Lakeland Hills (500 182nd Ave E, Auburn, WA)

  The events are open to all scouting/adventure groups and are aimed at helping scouts meet badge requirements in first aid, CPR/AED awareness, knot tying, disaster preparedness, home fire escape planning, forensics, and more. The flow for the events includes scouts arriving at various times and rotating through the learning stations they need to meet badge requirements. We aim for 10-15minute, interactive activities at most stations, but a few are 20 minutes.

  Feel free to register at any time by emailing your group name, contact person, phone number, email, and number of participants to public.info@vrfa.org.&nbsp; Also, please share the information with other local scout leaders to help us spread the word.

  Can’t make our event? Our friends over at Puget Sound Fire Authority are also hosting one on September 29th at their Station 35 (24611 116th Ave. SE in Kent).
