Join the Meals on Wheels volunteer team in Vashon, King County, to help combat hunger among homebound seniors. Volunteers are needed as Meal Packers and Delivery Drivers on Tuesday mornings from 9:15 am to 11:15 am. Training is provided, and ongoing commitment is encouraged. Ideal volunteers should possess good communication and people skills, reliability, a dedication to elder well-being, and a cheerful disposition. Familiarity with the West Seattle area is a plus. To volunteer, applicants must complete the Meals on Wheels Volunteer Application, agree to a Washington State Patrol background check, be able to lift 15 pounds, and be over the age of 18. This program not only provides nutritious food but also fosters personal contact and caring service to help seniors maintain their independence and health.
