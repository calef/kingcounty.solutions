Hormedys, originally from Venezuela, shares her journey of resilience and hope. After living under a repressive government that made daily life unbearable, she and her husband decided to leave for Colombia in January 2017. They sold their assets and departed, leaving behind family and dreams. In Colombia, they were welcomed and Hormedys established residency while starting small businesses. However, the worsening situation in Venezuela prompted them to seek asylum in the United States, which was granted in December 2023. They arrived in the U.S. in May 2024, marking a new beginning for their family.

Despite her age, Hormedys was determined to find work but faced a significant barrier: the language. She briefly worked in a hotel, which motivated her to learn English. She enrolled in college and explored opportunities in education and childcare. Through the Imagen Institute, she received training and completed her program by March 2025. Currently, she works in early childhood education, where she finds joy in teaching and instilling values in children. Hormedys aims to inspire others to pursue their dreams and not give up in the face of adversity.
