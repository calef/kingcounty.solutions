Justice, Professionalism, Service. The Asian Counseling and Referral Service (ACRS), in collaboration with the Asian Bar Association of Washington (ABAW) and the King County Bar Association (KCBA), has announced the relaunch of the Rainier Valley Legal Clinic. This pro bono clinic is an essential resource offering free legal consultations to low-income individuals, immigrants, and refugees in the Seattle area. The initiative aims to address legal needs within these communities, providing vital support and access to legal services. The clinic's reopening underscores a commitment to enhancing legal assistance for marginalized populations, ensuring that those who may face barriers to legal representation can receive the help they need. The partnership reflects a dedication to community service and the promotion of justice for all.
