SouthEast Effective Development (SEED) has officially transferred the operations and ownership of KVRU 105.7FM to Media for Informed Communities, led by Crystal Fincher and Monisha Harrell. The station, which began broadcasting on October 10, 2017, was developed with the encouragement of community members and has received over $750,000 in investments from SEED. KVRU has served as a vital resource for Southeast Seattle, providing media training, broadcasting community stories, and acting as an information hub. The new leadership aims to expand KVRU's programming to include local music, multi-lingual talk shows, community news, and high school sports coverage, enhancing its role as a voice for the diverse communities in the area. Crystal Fincher emphasized the importance of reflecting local voices and experiences, while Monisha Harrell highlighted the essential role of non-commercial community radio in maintaining local media representation. Maurice Jones Jr., the Programming Director since 2018, will remain in his position post-transition. Media for Informed Communities is committed to continuing KVRU’s mission of amplifying the diverse stories and voices of Southeast Seattle.
