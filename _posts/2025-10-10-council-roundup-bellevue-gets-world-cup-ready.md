The Bellevue City Council discussed preparations for the upcoming World Cup, anticipating an influx of 15,000 visitors during the tournament, which is expected to generate $23 million in economic impact. To accommodate the expected tourists, the Economic Development team plans to host World Cup-themed celebrations along the light rail's 2 Line corridor, providing support and funding to small businesses, artists, and cultural organizations for engaging activities. Additionally, curated tourism trails will be promoted on non-match days.

The council also reviewed the city’s first formal Hazard Mitigation Plan, which addresses potential natural hazards such as earthquakes, floods, and wildfires. This plan, created over two years with community input, aims to enhance preparedness and minimize risks, with an update scheduled every five years. A related disaster debris management plan was also drafted.

Furthermore, the council issued proclamations recognizing Indigenous Peoples' Day, Walk and Roll to School Day, and Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month.
