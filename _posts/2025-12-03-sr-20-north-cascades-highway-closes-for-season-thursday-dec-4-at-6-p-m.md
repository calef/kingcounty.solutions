State Route 20 North Cascades Highway will close for the winter season at 6 p.m. on Thursday, December 4. The closure affects Rainy Pass (elevation 4,862 feet) and Washington Pass (elevation 5,475 feet) between the Ross Dam trailhead (milepost 134) and Silver Star gate (milepost 171). Depending on conditions, the closure points may be adjusted to lower elevations later in the season, potentially moving to the Newhalem gate (milepost 120) on the west side and Early Winters gate (milepost 178) on the east side. The Washington State Department of Transportation has decided to close the highway due to current snow loads in avalanche pathways and anticipated snow showers beginning Friday, prioritizing the safety of travelers and crews. The earliest closure date for the North Cascades Highway was October 17, 2007, while the latest seasonal closure date was January 3, 1990. Travelers can access real-time information through the WSDOT mobile app, the real-time travel map, and can sign up for email updates and alerts. Current weather and highway conditions are also available on the WSDOT mountain passes webpage.
