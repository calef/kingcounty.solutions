On July 4, 2025, the federal government enacted H.R.1, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill, which imposes significant cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), jeopardizing food security for nearly one million residents in Washington state. This includes thousands of refugee and immigrant families who rely on SNAP as they adapt to life in the U.S. The law reduces average SNAP benefits by approximately $56 per household monthly, potentially resulting in skipped meals and decreased access to nutritious food. An estimated 130,000 Washingtonians face the risk of losing their benefits entirely.

SNAP not only aids families but also stimulates local economies; each dollar spent generates $1.54 in economic activity. The cuts could withdraw around $360 million annually from Washington's economy, adversely affecting immigrant, refugee, and minority communities. Compounding these federal reductions, Washington state is grappling with a $16 billion budget deficit, leading to over $28 million in cuts from the Economic Services Administration (ESA). This results in slower service delivery and longer wait times for assistance, particularly impacting families already facing barriers. Advocacy for compassionate and equitable policies is urged to support affected communities.
