Washington state is experiencing a significant loss of Black teachers, with many leaving the profession at higher rates than their white counterparts, particularly within their first five years. Despite nearly 60% of public school students in the Puget Sound being students of color, only 13% of teachers reflect that diversity. A report from the "Educators & Leaders of Color Listening Sessions" highlights that educators of color feel isolated, overburdened, and overlooked for leadership roles, driving many to exit the field. Studies indicate that having even one Black teacher increases the likelihood of Black students graduating and considering college, emphasizing the importance of representation. However, programs aimed at supporting Black and brown educators are often underfunded or cut, leading to generational consequences for students. Reports show that educators of color are leaving not due to the students but because of systemic racism and unmet promises. To address these issues, state and district leaders are urged to fully fund programs for educators of color, create equitable leadership opportunities, and actively involve these educators in decision-making processes. The future of education in Washington must recognize and support its diverse, multilingual, and visionary educators.
