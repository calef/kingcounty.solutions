Washington is experiencing a significant loss of Black teachers, exacerbated by systemic issues within the education system that push them out. Black educators leave the profession at higher rates than their white counterparts, often within their first five years. While nearly 60% of public school students in the Puget Sound region are students of color, only 13% of teachers reflect that demographic diversity. A recent report highlighted that educators of color face isolation, heavy workloads, and a lack of leadership opportunities, undermining their contributions to the school community.

Programs like the Technology Access Foundation’s Martinez Fellowship and Kent’s Educators of Color Network show promise in supporting these educators and enhancing student outcomes. However, these initiatives are chronically underfunded or cut as districts retreat from equity commitments. The experiences of teachers of color reveal a struggle against racism and broken promises, resulting in a "broken pipeline" where retention remains a challenge. To improve the situation, state and district leaders must fully fund programs supporting Black and brown educators, end inequitable practices, and actively involve educators of color in decision-making processes. The future of education in Washington relies on recognizing and empowering diverse educators.
