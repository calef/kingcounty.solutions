Aging in place allows older adults to remain in their homes and communities, but challenges like transportation, home maintenance, and social isolation can hinder independence. Villages, or senior villages, are grassroots, membership-based organizations that emerged in the early 2000s to support this goal. Inspired by Boston's Beacon Hill Village, they have spread across the U.S., providing networks of volunteers and local businesses to assist older adults.

Villages offer various services, including volunteer support for household tasks and transportation, social engagement activities to reduce loneliness, trusted referrals for services like home repairs, and wellness programs such as exercise classes. Each village operates independently, often with a small staff and a group of volunteers, sustaining operations through membership fees, with many offering sliding-scale options.

The benefits include helping older adults maintain control over their lives, fostering community connections, providing cost-effective support, and giving families peace of mind. Eastside Friends of Seniors (EFS) exemplifies this model, serving older adults in Issaquah, Sammamish, and Snoqualmie Valley with services like transportation, companionship, light home maintenance, and social activities, ensuring inclusivity and strengthening community ties.
