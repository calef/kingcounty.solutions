Seattle police arrested a 30-year-old violent felon armed with a machete during proactive patrols in the Chinatown-International District on Nov. 25, 2025. Officers recognized the man, who had outstanding warrants, while patrolling 12th Avenue South and South King Street at 2 a.m. When detained, he provided a false name. He was arrested on a $15,075 domestic violence warrant for assault with sexual motivation and other charges, as well as a $1,000 felony warrant for theft in the second degree. During the encounter, the suspect became aggressive, challenging officers and using slurs. He has a prior conviction for assault and intimidating a public servant, with a classification of "high violent" risk. Police recovered a machete with a duct-taped handle from his backpack and are recommending additional charges for unlawful use of weapons. The suspect was booked into the King County Jail.
