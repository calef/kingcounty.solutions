The City of Bellevue is relaunching its Cultural Conversations program as part of the 2025 lineup for Welcoming Week festivities. In its 15th year, the program aims to foster community connections through storytelling and dialogue. The season begins with the event titled "The Bellevue We Hope For," scheduled for September 15 from 6:30 to 8 p.m. at the Bellevue Botanical Garden. This gathering will feature a panel discussion with Kelly Aramaki, superintendent of the Bellevue School District; Randy Nuñez, founder of the Maíz Education Collaborative; and Ruhi Gadde, a local high school student. The panelists will share personal experiences and discuss the challenges faced by immigrants in Bellevue while inspiring hope for the community's future. Attendees will have the opportunity to provide feedback on future Cultural Conversations themes. The events are free but require registration. Cultural Conversations is sponsored by Amazon and aligns with the national Welcoming Week, which promotes inclusion for all residents, particularly newcomers.
