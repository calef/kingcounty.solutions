Rainier Valley Food Bank (RVFB) is inviting artists to design and create a large mural for their new facility, set to open in September 2025. This mural will be prominently displayed on the exterior of the building at 9021 Rainier Ave. S, visible from the storefront. RVFB aims to celebrate the vibrancy and diversity of the South Seattle community, incorporating themes of local history, culture, food, and mutual aid. They are looking for a local artist or artist team that can work within the project timeline and align with RVFB's vision of food justice and equity.

The selection process will shortlist approximately six artists, each receiving a $500 stipend for design proposals. A budget of up to $80,000 is allocated for the project, covering design concepts, materials, installation, and labor. The mural's size is estimated at 30' tall by 70' wide, totaling about 2,100 square feet. Artists are encouraged to demonstrate community connections and to create work that reflects diverse experiences. Applications are due by August 27, with a timeline for final selections and contract execution extending into October.
