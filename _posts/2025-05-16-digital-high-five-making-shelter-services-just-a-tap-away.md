Mary's Place has introduced user-friendly, self-service digital kiosks at its emergency shelters and the Allen Family Center, enhancing access to essential resources for families in need. Supported by funding from Comcast, these kiosks feature universal symbols and customizable language options, making it easier for guests, including those facing language barriers, to navigate services such as scheduling appointments and accessing legal assistance. Brian Carlson, IT Director at Mary’s Place, describes the kiosks as digital assistants that streamline daily tasks for guests.

The kiosks not only improve guest access but also help staff manage shelter operations more efficiently by providing real-time data on resource demand. This allows for better staff scheduling and equipment maintenance, ensuring that resources are available when needed. At the Allen Family Center, the kiosks facilitate quicker intakes and equitable access to amenities like showers and playgroups.

Additionally, the kiosks empower families by familiarizing them with digital tools, fostering self-advocacy as they work toward permanent housing. Comcast's ongoing partnership with Mary's Place plays a crucial role in bridging the digital divide and enhancing community support for families seeking safety and stability.
