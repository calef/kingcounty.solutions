Seattle has launched Eproval, a new online software for special events permitting aimed at simplifying and modernizing the application process. This system enhances the experience for event organizers by providing real-time visibility into permit statuses and improving communication with the Special Events Office through instant updates and notifications. Eproval replaces traditional email communication with easier access to necessary information and allows users to upload required documents online. For recurring events, applicants can duplicate past applications, reducing data entry time. Eproval is already in use by more than 100 municipalities across North America, including cities like Bellevue, San Diego, and Denver. This new system replaces a PDF application process that had been in place since 2012 and aligns with recommendations from the 2017 City Auditor’s report on special events and the 2024 Race and Social Justice analysis. The Seattle Special Events Committee, which includes representatives from various city and county agencies, typically approves about 400 permits each year for major events managed by the Special Events Office within the Office of Economic Development.
