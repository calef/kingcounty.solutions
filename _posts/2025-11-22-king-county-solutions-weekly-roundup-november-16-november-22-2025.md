King County Solutions tracked 82 public-sector updates for the week ending November 22, spanning housing, transit, food security, health, and youth support. With winter setting in and federal funding disruptions still rippling through safety-net systems, this week’s news shows local governments and nonprofits racing to stabilize essentials: homes, meals, and mental health care.

### Housing Stability, Homelessness & Affordability Push

The Washington State Department of Commerce reports intense demand for affordable housing dollars, with 112 applications seeking to build or preserve 6,791 units statewide through its latest funding round, detailed in *[Commerce receives 112 applications to recent funding opportunities](https://www.commerce.wa.gov/commerce-receives-112-applications-to-recent-funding-opportunities/)*. Commerce also spotlighted *[Generations Place](https://www.commerce.wa.gov/generations-place-a-community-effort-to-house-langley-workers-for-generations-to-come/)*, the first new affordable homes in Langley in 35 years, aimed at working families at risk of being priced out.

In Seattle, the Office of Housing opened a *[developer opportunity in South Park](https://housing.seattle.gov/developer-opportunity-help-build-affordable-housing-in-south-park/)* and up to *[$27.8 million in Urgent Operating Support](https://housing.seattle.gov/uos-rfq/)* to keep existing affordable buildings solvent as costs rise. Those moves align with the newly adopted 2026 city budget, which the Council describes in two companion summaries as making *[record investments in housing and homelessness response](https://council.seattle.gov/2025/11/20/seattle-city-council-committee-passes-budget-with-historic-investments-in-housing-public-safety-and-affordability/)*, including $349.5 million for affordable housing, expanded shelter, and rental assistance. District 7’s *[budget highlights from Councilmember Bob Kettle](https://council.seattle.gov/2025/11/21/councilmember-kettle-secures-funding-for-key-district-7-and-public-safety-priorities-in-2026-budget/)* add targeted funds for Pioneer Square homelessness outreach and sexual assault survivor services. On the ground, Catholic Community Services shows what these systems mean for families in *[Michelle and Brent’s journey from homelessness to stable housing](https://ccsww.org/michelle-and-brents-story-a-journey-from-homelessness-to-stable-housing/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=michelle-and-brents-story-a-journey-from-homelessness-to-stable-housing)*.

### Transit, Tech & Climate-Smart City Infrastructure

Transit riders in Rainier Valley will see faster, safer trips thanks to the completion of extended bus lanes on Route 7, covered by both Seattle Department of Transportation’s *[project update](https://sdotblog.seattle.gov/2025/11/19/extended-rainier-ave-s-bus-lanes/)* and King County Metro’s *[companion post](https://kingcountymetro.blog/2025/11/19/extended-rainier-avenue-bus-lanes-offer-seamless-more-reliable-trip-for-thousands-of-daily-riders/)*. The lanes, new crossings, and ADA upgrades are expected to save riders up to five minutes per peak trip and strengthen connections to light rail.

Seattle is also leaning into digital and climate innovation. The City earned national recognition in the *[Digital Cities Awards](https://techtalk.seattle.gov/2025/11/18/seattle-earns-national-recognition-in-annual-digital-cities-awards/)* for using technology to tackle safety, homelessness, and budget constraints, and its IT department’s *[“Old Tech” drive](https://techtalk.seattle.gov/2025/11/20/seattle-its-old-tech-drive-a-smashing-success/)* diverted 705 pounds of e‑waste while refurbishing devices for residents. On the freight side, SDOT launched a *[Commercial E‑Cargo Bike Program](https://sdotblog.seattle.gov/2025/11/20/seattle-commercial-e-cargo-bike-program/)* that lets businesses replace vans with lower-cost, zero‑emission cargo bikes. Seattle Public Utilities and WM backed neighborhood-scale waste reduction through *[ReThink Waste grants](https://atyourservice.seattle.gov/2025/11/19/seattle-public-utilities-and-wm-award-five-organizations-2025-rethink-waste-grants/)*, while the Office of Economic Development highlighted how *[Business Improvement Areas](https://bottomline.seattle.gov/2025/11/20/business-improvement-areas-provide-community-driven-approach-to-support-seattles-business-districts/)* fund local cleanliness, safety, and events.

### Community Care: Food, Holidays & Local Support

With Thanksgiving days away and a recent SNAP disruption still fresh, food providers are mobilizing. Rainier Valley Food Bank compiled a countywide guide to *[free community Thanksgiving meals](https://www.rvfb.org/blog/free-thanksgiving-meals-in-the-seattle-area)*, while Solid Ground detailed its rapid response to the federal benefits halt in *[Responding to the SNAP food benefits crisis](https://www.solid-ground.org/responding-to-the-snap-food-benefits-crisis/)*, from emergency grocery cards to shuttles to stores.

Holiday community-building is visible across the region. Seattle Fire and the U.S. Marine Corps are collecting toys for local kids through *[Toys for Tots events on December 6](https://fireline.seattle.gov/2025/11/19/seattle-fire-collecting-toys-for-toys-for-tots-on-dec-6/)*. Senior centers in Wallingford and Ballard shared their *[December lunch calendar](https://wallingfordseniors.org/december-2025-lunch-menu/)* and *[Thanksgiving week dining menu](https://ballardseniorcenter.org/dining-menu-november-24th-26th/)*, pairing meals with outings and social activities. In Burien, residents can meet staff and donate food and coats at a *[City Chat on economic development and human services](https://www.burienwa.gov/cms/One.aspx?portalId=11046019&pageId=21059577)*, while El Centro de la Raza’s *[“Cuentos from Our Work”](https://www.elcentrodelaraza.org/cuentos-from-our-work-november-2025/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=cuentos-from-our-work-november-2025)* recaps a Día de los Muertos celebration that blended cultural remembrance with justice-focused organizing. Solid Ground’s *[When community becomes family](https://www.solid-ground.org/when-community-becomes-family/)* shows how supportive housing can become a lifeline of mutual care for single parents and their kids.

### Equity, Health, Disability & Youth Empowerment

Federal and local agencies are sharpening their focus on vulnerable residents. The U.S. Department of Justice’s *[annual report on elder fraud and abuse](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-releases-2025-annual-report-congress-efforts-combat-elder-fraud-and-abuse)* outlines billions in attempted theft from older adults and new enforcement and victim-support tools. In King County, Crisis Connections’ password-protected *[impact report](https://www.crisisconnections.org/2025-crisis-connections-impact-report/)* highlights 24/7 crisis lines and suicide prevention work.

Disability justice and inclusive care are threaded through multiple stories. The UW Institute on Human Development and Disability shared a *[research study for parents of teens who use AAC](https://ihdd.org/2025/11/17/research-study-for-parents-of-teens-who-use-aac/)*, a profile of self-advocate Ben Moore’s *[path to medicine](https://ihdd.org/2025/11/17/full-circle-ben-moores-path-to-medicine/)*, a tribute *[honoring Alice Wong](https://ihdd.org/2025/11/18/honoring-the-life-of-alice-wong/)*, and a roundup of *[winter sensory-friendly events](https://ihdd.org/2025/11/19/winter-sensory-friendly-events-in-washington/)*. Boyer Children’s Clinic shared family stories in *[Cayden’s journey](https://www.boyercc.org/family-stories/cayden/)* and *[Calvontre & Ar’Quez](https://www.boyercc.org/family-stories/calvontre-arquez/)*, underscoring the impact of early intervention.

Youth mental health and culturally responsive services are another throughline. United Way of King County profiled its partnership with ACRS in *[Why We Partner With United Way?](https://www.uwkc.org/news/why-we-partner-with-united-way/)*, including support for Queer and Trans BIPOC youth. NAMI Eastside’s *[Building a Resilient Future](https://nami-eastside.org/building_a_resilient_future/)* calls for systemic fixes to youth suicide risk, while King County School Health covered both a *[Garfield High School clinic visit](https://kingcountyschoolhealthdotcom.wordpress.com/2025/11/20/garfield-sbhc-welcomes-phskc-and-wa-sbha/)* and DEEL’s *[Every Child Ready community conversations](https://kingcountyschoolhealthdotcom.wordpress.com/2025/11/21/deel-invites-seattle-youth-and-families-to-every-child-ready-community-conversations-series/)* on renewing the FEPP levy. DEEL also invited new providers into the *[Seattle Preschool Program](https://education.seattle.gov/opportunity-to-join-the-seattle-preschool-program-for-2026-2027-school-year/)* to expand high-quality, affordable preschool access.
