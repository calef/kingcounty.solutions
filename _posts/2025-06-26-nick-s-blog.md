By the time counseling began with KCSARC, the author had struggled for over a decade with the aftermath of sexual assault. Recent life changes, including a move and new job, triggered overwhelming anxiety linked to past trauma. Despite attempts to cope, social situations became increasingly difficult, prompting concerned friends to suggest counseling. The author discovered that while many KCSARC clients are male, men often feel isolated and ashamed about seeking help due to societal expectations. This internal struggle can lead to feelings of inadequacy and a shame spiral, which can exacerbate isolation and increase mental health risks, including suicide.

Counseling at KCSARC offers a confidential space for men to address their trauma without fear of judgment. The author encourages men to reflect on the kind of person they want to become and to reach out for support. Building a network of emotionally supportive peers can also combat isolation. With June recognized as Men’s Mental Health Awareness Month, the author emphasizes that men who have experienced sexual assault are not alone and should take advantage of available resources, like KCSARC’s 24-hour Resource Line, to begin their healing journey.
