On September 7, 2025, a reflection on the Apostle Paul’s letter to Philemon highlights the complex relationships between Paul, Philemon, and Onesimus. Paul, imprisoned for his faith, writes to Philemon, a wealthy church leader and slave owner, regarding Onesimus, who has either escaped or been loaned to Paul. The letter challenges the norms of slavery and emphasizes the transformative power of love and the gospel. Paul urges Philemon to accept Onesimus not just as a slave but as a brother in Christ, risking upheaval in their social order. The reflection explores the implications of this appeal, considering the social and economic ramifications for Philemon and the lack of agency for Onesimus, who desires freedom. It draws parallels to modern injustices, questioning how the gospel can address systemic issues like immigration and discrimination. The call to love all neighbors, regardless of background, is underscored, with an acknowledgment that following Christ may lead to personal sacrifice and conflict. Ultimately, the hope is for a community where all individuals are valued and welcomed as equals at the table of faith.
