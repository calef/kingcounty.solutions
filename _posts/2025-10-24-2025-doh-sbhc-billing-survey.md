The Washington State Department of Health (DOH) is conducting the 2025 SBHC billing survey to gather information on billing and funding practices for school-based health centers (SBHCs) in Washington. This survey, a follow-up to a 2023 initiative, aims to identify current funding structures, billing practices, and challenges faced by SBHCs. The online survey consists of approximately 35 questions, including sections on funding and billing for confidential services. The findings will be used to enhance technical assistance and support for SBHCs, aiming to improve understanding of the funding landscape, address gaps, and enhance training and resources. All operational SBHCs are encouraged to participate, ideally with input from those most knowledgeable about their funding and billing. The survey is available until January 31, 2026, and participants can save their responses and return later. As an incentive, each SBHC represented in the survey will be entered into a drawing for a $250 e-gift card for supplies or equipment. For questions, participants can contact Kate Meehan at DOH.
