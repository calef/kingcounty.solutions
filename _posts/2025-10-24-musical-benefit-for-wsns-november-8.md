The Boeing Employees Choir, a nonprofit organization dedicated to community service, will host a benefit concert for Westside Neighbors Shelter on November 8. The event will take place at St. John the Baptist Church in West Seattle, located at 3050 California Ave SW. Attendees of the choir's previous benefit in April 2024 are already familiar with their talent, which includes former member Keith Hughes joining them onstage for a performance. The concert promises to be a delightful afternoon of music, with a suggested donation of $15 at the door. All proceeds from the event will support the shelter in preparing for the upcoming cold season.
