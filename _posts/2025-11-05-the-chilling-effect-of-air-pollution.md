A new University of Washington study reveals that efforts to reduce air pollution have inadvertently led to decreased cloud reflectivity, exacerbating global warming. Between 2003 and 2022, marine clouds over the Northeastern Pacific and Atlantic oceans became nearly 3% less reflective per decade, largely due to the reduction of sulfate aerosols, which play a critical role in cloud formation and longevity. As these aerosols diminish, cloud droplet size increases, leading to fewer, larger droplets that fall more quickly as precipitation, reducing cloud cover.

The findings indicate that the cooling effect of particulate pollution had previously masked some warming from greenhouse gases. With observed temperatures surpassing climate model predictions, scientists emphasize the need to refine climate models to better account for the relationship between aerosols, clouds, and solar radiation. Researchers are also exploring methods like marine cloud brightening, which could enhance cloud reflectivity without introducing harmful pollutants. The study underscores the urgency of reassessing climate mitigation strategies as warming trends accelerate, particularly in vulnerable marine ecosystems.
