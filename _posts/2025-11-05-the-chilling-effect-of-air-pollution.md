  <p class="wp-caption-text">The streaks in this satellite image are from ships, which emit sulfate aerosols that can be toxic to humans and the environment. Aerosols also make the clouds more reflective.

  <p>Earth is reflecting less sunlight, and absorbing more heat, than it did several decades ago. Global warming is advancing faster than climate models predicted, with observed temperatures exceeding projections in 2023 and 2024. These trends have scientists scrambling to understand why the atmosphere is letting more light in.</p>
  <p>A new study, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-65127-x">published Nov. 5 in Nature Communications</a>, shows that reducing air pollution has inadvertently diminished the brightness of marine clouds, which are key regulators of global temperature.</p>
  <p>Between 2003 and 2022, clouds over the Northeastern Pacific and Atlantic oceans, both sites of rapid surface warming, became nearly 3% less reflective per decade. Researchers attribute approximately 70% of this change to aerosols — <a href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/5552/">fine particles that float through the atmosphere</a> and influence both cloud cover and cloud composition.</p>
  <p>When research emerged showing that some aerosols are harmful, efforts to limit particulate pollution — specifically targeting the products of fossil fuel combustion — followed. Aerosol levels will likely continue to fall as clean energy replaces oil and gas. To improve the accuracy of global temperature forecasts, scientists need to capture the true relationship between aerosols, clouds, and heat from the sun in climate models.</p>
  <p>“This paper is a substantial contribution to the evidence that reductions in particulate air pollutants are contributing to accelerated warming.” said <a href="https://cicoes.uw.edu/research/principal-investigators/sarah-j-doherty/">Sarah Doherty</a>, a principal research scientist at the UW Cooperative Institute for Climate, Ocean and Ecosystem Studies.</p>

  <p>Researchers knew that low clouds over the ocean would dissipate as temperatures rose, exposing more surface area to warming sunlight and amplifying its effect. They also knew that particles in the atmosphere insulate Earth both by deflecting light and making the entire cloud more reflective.</p>
  <p>The cooling effect from particulate pollution masked warming from greenhouse gases for decades. Accelerated warming was a potential consequence of improving air quality.</p>
  <p>“It is clearly a good thing that we have been reducing particle pollution in the atmosphere,&#8221; Doherty said. “We don’t want to go back in time and take away the Clean Air Act.”</p>
  <p><a href="https://www.epa.gov/clean-air-act-overview/evolution-clean-air-act">Passed in 1963</a>, the Clean Air Act marked the first of many worldwide efforts to control pollution.</p>

The researchers analyzed 20 years of satellite data documenting cloud dynamics above these bodies of water to identify the drivers behind the observed reduction in reflectivity.</p>
  <p>They found that aerosols influence clouds in two ways. Small particles give water droplets something to cling to, and with a fixed amount of water, more aerosols means more small, shiny droplets in the clouds.

A new University of Washington study reveals that efforts to reduce air pollution have inadvertently led to decreased cloud reflectivity, exacerbating global warming. Between 2003 and 2022, marine clouds over the Northeastern Pacific and Atlantic oceans became nearly 3% less reflective per decade, largely due to the reduction of sulfate aerosols, which play a critical role in cloud formation and longevity. As these aerosols diminish, cloud droplet size increases, leading to fewer, larger droplets that fall more quickly as precipitation, reducing cloud cover.

The findings indicate that the cooling effect of particulate pollution had previously masked some warming from greenhouse gases. With observed temperatures surpassing climate model predictions, scientists emphasize the need to refine climate models to better account for the relationship between aerosols, clouds, and solar radiation. Researchers are also exploring methods like marine cloud brightening, which could enhance cloud reflectivity without introducing harmful pollutants. The study underscores the urgency of reassessing climate mitigation strategies as warming trends accelerate, particularly in vulnerable marine ecosystems.
