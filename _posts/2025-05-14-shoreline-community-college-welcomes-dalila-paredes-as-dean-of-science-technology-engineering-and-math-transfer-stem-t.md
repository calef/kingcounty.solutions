Shoreline Community College has appointed Dalila Paredes as the new Dean of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math Transfer (STEM-T). Paredes brings over a decade of experience in STEM education and more than eight years of leadership in higher education. She holds an M.S. in Chemistry and a B.S. in Biology and Chemistry from West Texas A&M University. Her work focuses on fostering inclusive learning environments, drawing on her personal experiences with gun violence and food and housing insecurity, which inspire her commitment to educational access for marginalized communities.

Paredes previously served as the MESA Director at Clark College, enhancing support for underserved STEM students and building partnerships with faculty and community organizations. As interim Dean at Shoreline since 2022, she has managed over 50 faculty and staff, supported over 850 STEM students, and overseen significant STEM budgets and grant funding. Her strategic goals include expanding interdisciplinary STEM programs and promoting culturally inclusive curricula. Paredes emphasizes shared governance and uplifting unheard voices in education, believing in the transformative power of education. Outside of her professional role, she enjoys outdoor activities with her family and engages in woodworking and leathercrafting.
