  February 2023 to February 2024, there were [102,996 _reported_ deaths from drug
  overdoses](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm) in the United
  States. (CDC 2024). This potential connection to treatment is critical, when data
  from the annual [National Survey on Drug Use and Health](https://www.samhsa.gov/data/sites/default/files/reports/rpt47095/National%20Report/National%20Report/2023-nsduh-annual-national.pdf)
  shows that in the past year, around 3 in 4 people who needed treatment for substance
  use in 2023 did not get it ([SAMHSA 2024](https://www.samhsa.gov/newsroom/press-announcements/20240730/samhsa-releases-annual-national-survey-drug-use-and-health)).
  In other words, 70.8 million people in the United States did not receive the support
  they needed.&nbsp;\n\nHarm reduction services can reduce the number of deaths due
  to substance use and increase the number of people who receive support by providing
  resources needed to make positive change.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nRecovery is complicated.
  Many people who have a substance use disorder (SUD) believe they would benefit from
  substance use treatment, yet do not seek it. Likewise, there are a wide variety
  of reasons why someone may use substances and not everyone wants to stop completely.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nFor
  someone who is using substances, the inability, or lack of desire, to access treatment
  is not a reflection of their character – for some, envisioning recovery feels impossible
  and managing withdrawal symptoms can often be so painful that it feels insurmountable.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nNo
  matter what stage of their journey, people who use substances need to be supported
  if they are to get to recovery – in the meantime, active users are at serious risk
  for disease and death from overdose. Fentanyl is an enormous issue now; when you
  cannot know for certain what the dosage is, it is especially easy to overdose. This
  is where harm reduction becomes an important philosophy and practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n###
  **What is harm reduction?&nbsp;**\n\nHarm reduction is designed to “empower people
  who use drugs (and their families) with the choice to live healthy, self-directed,
  and purpose-filled lives (SAMHSA).” For example, having access to clean needles
  to prevent transmission of disease and Narcan, which can be administered to those
  who have overdosed to save them, all help protect substance users on their journey.
  Harm reduction can also look like only using substances with friends to ensure someone
  is there to help you if you are in a medical crisis.&nbsp;\n\n Another strategy
  for harm reduction is prescribing Buprenorphine (or other similar medications) to
  help individuals manage the overwhelming withdrawal symptoms associated with opiates.&nbsp;
  Taking these prescriptions helps reduce withdrawal symptoms under the guidance and
  management of a doctor. However, many persons struggling with substance use find
  themselves in the ER rather than with their primary care physician in the moments
  where Buprenorphine could help them the most.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n Doctors who see a
  patient for one visit often don’t feel comfortable prescribing a high dosage of
  Buprenorphine without knowing they will have follow-up care to continue safe and
  monitored dosage. It is for this reason that the Bridger program was created – to
  provide physicians with the support they need to engage in harm reduction strategies
  with patients.&nbsp;\n\n### How does the Bridger Program work?&nbsp;\n\nProviders
  enrolled in the Bridger program are able to contact the WA Recovery Helpline to
  schedule follow-up care for patients with an appropriate clinic. Once an appointment
  is scheduled, physicians can provide patients with a “bridger dose” that will alleviate
  patients withdrawal symptoms, therefore making them more likely to engage with recovery
  strategies and receive longer-term support, and less likely to relapse. The helpline
  will also stay in touch with the patient to follow up for accountability and make
  sure they make their appointments. _This is specifically a program between medical
  providers and the Washington Helpline, and is one of two programs in the country
  that is able to provide this much-needed service.&nbsp;_&nbsp;\n\n### What else
  does Washington Recovery Helpline do?&nbsp;\n\nBeyond this program, the Washington
  Recovery Helpline is a 24/7 phone line–-with a text option from 9am to 9pm M-F,
  and an email in which you will receive a response within 2 business days–for anyone
  struggling with substance use, problem gambling, or a mental health challenge in
  Washington State. We provide emotional support and can help you find resources near
  you.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n  **If you are struggling with substance use:** there are communities
  full of people who want to support you. The support for the Bridger program has
  been enormous and heartwarming; we are here for you, and we are ready to listen
  and meet you where you are. It is not weak to seek treatment, and we do not think
  you are a bad person for using substances.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n  **If you are a family
  member or friend to someone who uses substances:** we see you and are here for you
  too. Watching someone you care about struggle is challenging, and substance use
  issues can make it especially difficult to know what actions to take. No matter
  what you are feeling, we are here to listen without judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n  **Reach

The Bridger Program is designed to support those struggling with substance use, with physicians providing resources to help manage withdrawal symptoms and encourage recovery. The program also promotes harm reduction strategies, such as using clean needles and administering Narcan to those who have overdosed. The Washington Recovery Helpline aids in scheduling follow-up care with appropriate clinics, allowing physicians to provide a "bridger dose" to alleviate withdrawal symptoms. The Helpline also provides emotional support and resources for those struggling with substance use, gambling problems, or mental health challenges. The Bridger Program is one of only two programs in the U.S. offering such services.
