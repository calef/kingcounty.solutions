BrightSpark emphasizes the importance of workplace giving and matching gifts as a reliable source of year-round support for their initiatives. By participating in payroll deductions or company matching programs, donors can significantly contribute to BrightSpark's mission to support children, families, and early learning providers consistently throughout the year. These donations help provide essential training and resources for early educators, advocate for equitable access to quality early learning, and assist families navigating complex childcare systems. Even small recurring donations can lead to substantial changes in the community, especially when paired with employer matches. Donors are encouraged to check if their employers offer matching gift programs to maximize their contributions. BrightSpark accepts various forms of donations, including cash, credit cards, stocks, and donor-advised funds. The organization expresses gratitude to contributors for helping all children learn, grow, and thrive both now and in the future. For more information on donation methods, individuals can reach out to BrightSpark’s fund development department.
