  \"Fund Dev Newsletter Banners (4)\")\n\n## **Your workplace gift makes a real difference!**\n\n|
  Last week, we shared how workplace giving and matching gifts can help your donation
  go twice as far. But did you know these gifts make up one of the most reliable,
  year-round sources of support for BrightSpark’s work?  \n  \nWhen you give through
  payroll deduction or a company match, you’re helping ensure we can keep showing
  up for children, families, and early learning providers, not just in moments of
  crisis, but every day of the year.  \n  \nThese consistent gifts help us:  \n  \nProvide
  training and resources for early educators  \nAdvocate for equitable access to quality
  early learning  \nSupport families navigating complex childcare systems  \n  \nEven
  small recurring gifts, when combined with employer matches, add up to lasting change
  for kids in our community.  \n  \nIf you haven’t yet checked, it only takes a minute
  to see if your employer participates and to make your next gift go even further.

BrightSpark emphasizes the importance of workplace giving and matching gifts as a reliable source of year-round support for their initiatives. By participating in payroll deductions or company matching programs, donors can significantly contribute to BrightSpark's mission to support children, families, and early learning providers consistently throughout the year. These donations help provide essential training and resources for early educators, advocate for equitable access to quality early learning, and assist families navigating complex childcare systems. Even small recurring donations can lead to substantial changes in the community, especially when paired with employer matches. Donors are encouraged to check if their employers offer matching gift programs to maximize their contributions. BrightSpark accepts various forms of donations, including cash, credit cards, stocks, and donor-advised funds. The organization expresses gratitude to contributors for helping all children learn, grow, and thrive both now and in the future. For more information on donation methods, individuals can reach out to BrightSpark’s fund development department.
