  <p>The University of Washington today announced a foundational $10 million gift from philanthropists Charles and Lisa Simonyi to support groundbreaking work in artificial intelligence and emerging technologies.</p>
  <p>The gift will establish a new initiative, AI@UW, to support the UW’s global leadership in advancing AI, machine learning and related areas of computing. Noah A. Smith, currently the Amazon Professor of Machine Learning in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science &amp; Engineering, will become the vice provost for artificial intelligence and the inaugural Charles and Lisa Simonyi Endowed Chair for Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technologies. The chair appointment is pending Board of Regents approval.</p>
  <p>&#8220;With this generous gift from Charles and Lisa Simonyi, we will further position the UW as a model for how universities can responsibly and creatively adapt to the age of AI across education, research, administration and governance,” UW Provost Tricia Serio said. “By leading the AI@UW initiative, Vice Provost Noah Smith will guide our efforts to accelerate innovation and collaboration, illuminate achievements, propagate effective practices throughout the UW community and beyond, and ensure that our graduates are prepared for the workforce of today and tomorrow.”</p>

  <p>UW researchers and faculty already are globally recognized for cultivating a deep understanding of the science and potential of these rapidly developing technologies. Work at the UW is creating practical and responsible applications for AI that span the academic enterprise, contribute to industry and uplift society.</p>
  <p>Charles and Lisa Simonyi have a long history of supporting the UW. Lisa Simonyi is the chair of the UW Foundation Board, and Charles Simonyi is a technical fellow at Microsoft, where he also was a pioneer in developing software applications.</p>
  <p>“The future of computing, research and innovations is deeply connected to the next era in artificial intelligence and machine learning,” Lisa and Charles Simonyi said. “We believe in the UW’s ability to engage students and faculty toward discoveries that will transform the university, the region and, indeed, the world. We are pleased to lend our support to advancing this exciting, interdisciplinary field.”</p>
  <p>The Charles and Lisa Simonyi gift also will support the creation of an AI governance committee, student scholarships, community engagement and investments in computing resources and equipment.</p>
  <p>“This extraordinary gift from the Simonyis demonstrates their vision and deep trust in the UW’s role as a global leader in innovation,” UW President Robert J. Jones said. “It is a foundational investment that will help ensure artificial intelligence is developed and applied responsibly — serving humanity and advancing knowledge in ways that reflect our shared values.”</p>

  <p>In the near term, the vice provost for artificial intelligence will establish a SEED-AI grant program to fund projects, led by UW faculty, that elevate the use of AI in UW educational activities. SEED-AI grants will support innovative, exploratory projects aiming to discover how AI can enhance learning and teaching across disciplines, enlighten the UW community, and inspire future developments of AI in the educational context.</p>
  <p>Thanks to the Simonyi gift, Smith said, the UW will model how universities can responsibly and creatively adapt to the age of AI across education, research, administration and governance.</p>
  <p>“The UW’s people are already leading the way in shaping universities in the time of AI,” Smith said. “While its rapid rise has been surprising, as an AI researcher and teacher I’m energized by the chance to promote AI literacy, explore how AI can enrich learning across disciplines and help steer AI&#8217;s development in ways that are most useful to the University’s mission.”</p>
