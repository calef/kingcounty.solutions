The University of Washington (UW) has received a $10 million donation from philanthropists Charles and Lisa Simonyi to establish AI@UW, an initiative focused on advancing artificial intelligence and emerging technologies. This gift will enhance UW's leadership in AI and machine learning, with Noah A. Smith appointed as the vice provost for artificial intelligence and the first Charles and Lisa Simonyi Endowed Chair for Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technologies, pending Board of Regents approval. The funding will support the creation of an AI governance committee, student scholarships, and investments in computing resources. The Simonyis, long-time supporters of UW, emphasized the importance of AI in transforming education and driving innovation. In the near term, the initiative will launch a SEED-AI grant program to fund faculty-led projects that explore AI's role in enhancing learning. UW President Robert J. Jones highlighted the gift as a foundational investment that reflects the university's commitment to developing AI responsibly. Smith expressed excitement about promoting AI literacy and ensuring that AI development aligns with the university's mission.
