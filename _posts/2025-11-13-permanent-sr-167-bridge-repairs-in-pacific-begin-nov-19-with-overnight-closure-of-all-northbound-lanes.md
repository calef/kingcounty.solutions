Permanent repairs on the northbound State Route 167 bridge over Third Avenue Southwest in Pacific will begin on Nov. 19, following damage caused by an over-height vehicle. All northbound lanes will be closed overnight from 11 p.m. on Nov. 19 to 5 a.m. on Nov. 20, with traffic resuming the next morning reduced to one lane. This lane reduction will remain in effect 24/7 during the repair period, which is expected to last until early 2026. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) has awarded a $1.6 million contract to Johansen Construction Co. to carry out the repairs.

The Third Avenue Southwest road beneath the bridge will also be closed starting Nov. 19 until the repairs are completed, with a signed detour provided. Approximately 50,000 vehicles travel this section daily, prompting WSDOT to advise commuters to plan for delays and consider alternate routes. Construction crews will work around the clock to restore the bridge to its pre-strike condition, following an emergency proclamation issued by the governor for federal reimbursement of repair costs.
