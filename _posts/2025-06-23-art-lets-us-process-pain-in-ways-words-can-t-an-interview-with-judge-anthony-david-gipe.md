  ###### _Anthony Gipe sits at a conference table in the University of Washington Bothell’s Health and Wellness Center, holding up a monochrome oil on canvas painting, “Grief.” The painting, entirely in grey tones, shows a figure seated with their head resting on their knees, powerfully conveying emotional struggle. Gipe, an Anderson Cooper look-alike, wears a grey suit, light collared shirt, patterned tie, and glasses, surrounded by art supplies and a water bottle on the table. A projector screen glows behind him as part of a hybrid in-person and Zoom classroom. Gipe shared insights from his personal journey with mental health and the role of art in his advocacy within the judiciary. In response to the story of the inspiration behind this painting (his twin brother’s death), our classmate Campbell Fera shared that “His stories about why he has painted the feeling of grief is powerful. We feel like a lot of people could relate to this artwork.” (Photo credit: Renee Uppal)_

  _On a warm spring evening at the University of Washington Bothell, our team had the opportunity to sit down with_ [_Anthony David Gipe (ADG)_](https://www.courts.wa.gov/index.cfm?fa=home.sub&org=mjc&layout=2&page=bioGipe) _of Kent Municipal Court on his role as an educator for art as it intersects with mental wellness and justice. The interview took place in a quiet, softly lit conference room where the soft hum of a projector and the occasional thump of music from a nearby event set the backdrop for a conversation filled with vulnerability and insight._

  _Gipe explained how his paintings are a vital tool for self-expression, healing, and advocacy. He offered us his perspective on how creative practice can begin to transform the legal system and help it better serve the public.&nbsp;_

  **How do you believe artistic expression can aid in destigmatizing mental health, especially among young adults?**

  **ADG:** Let me ask you a question in return. What do you believe is the purpose of art? What is art, if you had to define it?

  _(Audience responses: to convey emotions, morals, visual expression…)_

  Exactly. When we express thoughts with words, we call it communication. Art is just another medium of communication. And because it is often visual, it can sometimes communicate more than words ever could. Do you know how much of communication is actually based on words? Only 7%. The rest is body language, tone, and other non-verbal cues. So art, which taps into those forms, can be even more effective than speech.

  When you create art about [depression](https://www.nami.org/about-mental-illness/mental-health-conditions/depression/), [grief](https://www.nami.org/personal-stories/grief/), or anger, you’re expressing something words often fail to capture. Words lack the lived experience behind emotions. That’s why art is powerful in mental health. It allows people to express feelings that don’t have clear verbal definitions. My late twin brother was a psychologist and former marine who dealt with [PTSD](https://www.nami.org/video-resource-library/what-is-ptsd/). From both research and his personal experience, he found that showing emotions through art is significantly more effective than simply talking about them.

  When people use art to process feelings, they ruminate less. They fixate less. They move forward more easily. That’s why I often use art in my own healing, and even in my courtroom. Let me show you three paintings: one for depression, one for anger, and one for grief.

  **_“Depression” by Anthony David Gipe. Oil on Canvas, 2024._**

  ###### _Gipe’s “Depression” presents a haunting image of emotional withdrawal and vulnerability. The figure is turned inward, arms wrapped tightly around their head and body in a posture that conveys both protection and collapse. One eye peers through a tangle of red curls, framed by a pale hand that bisects the face and draws the viewer into the subject’s guarded inner world. The lips are painted a muted red, hinting at pain held quietly rather than expressed aloud. Behind the figure, streaks of blue and grey run vertically down the canvas, resembling rain or a blurred curtain, further emphasizing the atmosphere of isolation. The brushwork is soft yet deliberate, creating a sense of fragility and weight. A classmate reflected, “I quite enjoyed his art piece about depression, just something about the coloring and stylistic choices added on with the effect that was added at the end.”_

  &nbsp;

  **ADG:** The “Depression” piece. I painted this in just a few hours. Does it say something that the word itself doesn’t? Now here’s “Anger.” Look at the red tones, the contrast. Red is often associated with rage. And “Grief,” note the posture, the letter in the figure’s hands, the streaking paint like tears. I’ve painted versions of this one for nearly ten years. My brother’s sudden death a decade ago inspired this ongoing series. Art lets us process pain in ways words can’t. That’s why it works.

  **_“Anger” by Anthony David Gipe. Oil on canvas, 2024._**

  ###### _Gipe’s “Anger” piece depicts a human figure screaming. The figure is shown from the shoulders up with their mouth wide open in a primal, guttural cry. Their eyes are clenched shut, and the expression conveys pain, rage, or desperation. The background contrasts sharply, featuring abstract, blocky patches of pale blue, grey, white, and deep red. These geometric shapes create a sense of fragmentation and emotional dissonance, complementing the figure’s chaos. The hair is painted in dark, jagged strokes, flying backward as if caught in an unseen gust or explosion of emotion. Splashes of red and blue paint extend outward from the figure, adding to the violent, raw energy of the scene. Another classmate stated, “I think it really does embody the emotion of anger, from the way the person was screaming to using the color red as a way to show anger.”_

  &nbsp;

  **How has your work as a judge and artist shaped the way you view emotional and psychological needs in the justice system?**

  **ADG:** The legal system is built to preserve the status quo. It’s rigid, often emotionless. I preside over criminal court, and I’ve seen firsthand how people feel alienated, like the court doesn’t care about them. That has to change.

  **_“Diversity” by Anthony David Gipe. Oil on canvas, 2018.&nbsp;_**

  ###### _A vibrant and dynamic celebration of unity, Gipe’s “Diversity” piece intertwines bold colors and expressive figures through spelling out ‘diversity’ in American sign language using hands of different race, genders, and abilities. This was done as a way to reflect the strength, complexity, and beauty found in human difference and shared experience. The V hand includes a BLM ring and is also a peace sign. The S is a symbol for power movement. The Y is also the Hawaiian “hang loose” sign and is a sign for friendship.This has become one of Gipe’s most recognized pieces. One participant mentioned that “It reminded me that true diversity includes race, culture, and ability. It also made me think about how we communicate and the importance of making space for all voices. I noticed that others around me were really moved by the piece too—it didn’t need words to deliver a powerful message.”_

  &nbsp;

  **ADG:** Art in the courtroom can help. One of my most recognized paintings spells out “diversity” in American Sign Language using hands from different genders and ethnicities. It’s been displayed across courthouses and public institutions around the world. Art like that tells people: this space sees you. You matter here.

  **_“The Long Night of Lady Justice” by Anthony David Gipe, 2020.&nbsp;_**

  ###### _Gipe’s “The Long Night of Lady Justice” piece depicts a blindfolded woman in a dark gown, symbolizing a weary Lady Justice, sitting slumped in a chair with one hand covering her face in anguish. Her sword droops at her side, and a scroll stabbed with a dagger lies on the table before her, surrounded by scattered legal texts and broken shackles. A skeletal arm holds uneven scales above a skull resting on open books, while a cracked, starry window looms in the background. Rich red curtains frame the somber, shadowy scene, evoking a sense of justice lost or deeply burdened. One student shared that “The piece made me think about how meaning isn’t always what it seems and how art invites us to look deeper. I liked how it combined technical skill with a deeper, symbolic message.”_

  ###### **ADG:** Here’s another example, “_The Long Night of Lady Justice_.” She’s Afro-Latina, almost lifting her blindfold in frustration. She’s writing down the barriers to equal justice. Her sword is cracked, her scales are skulls. And yet, she holds a writ of habeas corpus, the right to be freed from unlawful imprisonment. It’s a critique of justice, not from hatred, but from care. These kinds of visuals, not bland photographs, are what people should see when they walk into a courtroom. They should feel represented.

  &nbsp;

  **Has your work ever received backlash?**

  **ADG:** Funny you ask. That “_Diversity_” piece once caused controversy. It had been displayed widely without issue. But in a town in eastern Pierce County, a city council member objected when it was hung near the council chamber, which also functions as a courtroom. She said it was dangerous and accused it of promoting defunding the police. Why? Because the Black man’s hand forming the letter “V” had a ring inscribed with “BLM,” Black Lives Matter. She was uncomfortable with the painting. And when pressed, she admitted she didn’t like that it said “Diversity.” That tells you everything. Only one complaint out of hundreds. But even that one complaint proved the painting’s power. It communicated. Loudly. That’s art doing its job. As a judge, I can’t speak on certain things publicly. But as an artist, I can. And I do.

  **You include a lot of themes like diversity and inclusion in your work. Do you have upcoming projects that touch on these or other intersections of art, justice, and societal wellness?**

  **ADG:** I’m doing a training for Pierce County judges on the role of creative practice in justice, and another national presentation this summer. Last year, I even spoke in Portugal on art and social change.

  I’m a huge fan of street art. Artists like Blu in Italy and Portuguese muralist Farto inspire me. Blu creates commentary on corporate greed by plastering paintings on condemned buildings. Once, a billionaire bought a building to keep a painting, and Blu returned just to plaster over it himself. That’s protest. I also love Bordalo II, who uses trash and recycled materials to build 3D murals. These artists aren’t just making art. They’re shaping public discourse.

  **What’s your connection to UW Bothell?**

  **ADG:** I took a French class here years ago. [Then I was invited to co-teach a class](https://www.uwb.edu/news/2025/01/30/business-students-empowered-through-mental-health-first-aid-training) [with Professor Umetsu] on art, mental health, and justice. We created art in that course, and some of it was later shown in an exhibit on campus. It was meaningful, and I’ve stayed connected ever since.

  **How do you see the role of artistic expression in advancing mental health and community engagement, especially in legal spaces?**

  **ADG:** The arts world is getting better at addressing mental health. Art therapists are finally being recognized as essential. But the law hasn’t caught up yet. It’s still conservative, still slow to change. Therapeutic courts are helping. Here in Washington, we’ve added around 30 in the past few years. These courts address addiction, trauma, and poverty, the root causes of many crimes. Nationally, these programs have about a 50% success rate in sustained sobriety and mental health. My court’s rate is 86%, but the broader system won’t adopt this approach until we have more hard data. Some states still refuse to run therapeutic courts.&nbsp;

  I redesigned my own courtroom. I removed the intimidating high bench. Now I sit barely elevated, at a desk that can move up or down. The room includes art, natural light, and fewer barriers. It still looks like a courtroom, but it feels more human. We need justice spaces that reflect humanity, not hierarchy. That’s the future, and your generation will be the one to build it.

  **What would you say to someone who says they’re not an artist, but want to explore art for self-care or healing?**

  **ADG:** I’ll borrow from three thinkers. First, Picasso said, “Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain one once we grow up.” We all have the capacity for creative expression. Second, Salvador Dali warned against perfection. He said the pursuit of perfection destroys art and the artist. You don’t have to be perfect. That’s not the point. Finally, a 16th-century Zen monk once said: “There is no purpose for the art other than to do the art.” That’s it. Just start.

  _Gipe’s words prompted students to see art not just as expression, but as a powerful tool for connection and healing, shifting how they understood the value of creative expression. Reflecting on the impact of our conversation, one student shared that “Before Gipe’s visit, I thought that art was just a way to express one’s interests or comment on what’s going on in society. Now, I know that art can also be a form of therapy for mental health and an effective form of communication with other people.”&nbsp;_

  _Our conversation with Gipe illuminated the transformative power of art in both mental health and the legal systems. Through his roles as a judge and artist, he bridges the seemingly distant worlds of justice and artistic expression, creating a more empathetic and inclusive legal system. His vulnerability, knowledge, and artistic passion offer a powerful reminder that meaningful reform of oppressive systems sometimes begins with storytelling through art. Gipe’s work challenges us to rethink the courtroom as not just a site of law, but as a space for empathy and healing. As Gipe stated, “remember you don’t need to be an artist to create a meaningful piece.”_

Judge Anthony David Gipe, a Kent Municipal Court judge and artist, shared his perspective on how art can aid in mental health and justice in an interview at the University of Washington Bothell's Health and Wellness Center. Gipe uses his paintings as tools for self-expression, healing, and advocacy, conveying emotions like depression, grief, and anger that can be hard to express in words. He believes art can help transform the legal system by promoting empathy and inclusivity. His works, such as "Diversity", have been displayed in courthouses worldwide. Despite occasional backlash, he continues to use art to communicate on topics he cannot address publicly as a judge.
