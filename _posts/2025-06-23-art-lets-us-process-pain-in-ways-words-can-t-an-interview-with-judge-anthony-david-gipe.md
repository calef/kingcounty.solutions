Judge Anthony David Gipe, a Kent Municipal Court judge and artist, shared his perspective on how art can aid in mental health and justice in an interview at the University of Washington Bothell's Health and Wellness Center. Gipe uses his paintings as tools for self-expression, healing, and advocacy, conveying emotions like depression, grief, and anger that can be hard to express in words. He believes art can help transform the legal system by promoting empathy and inclusivity. His works, such as "Diversity", have been displayed in courthouses worldwide. Despite occasional backlash, he continues to use art to communicate on topics he cannot address publicly as a judge.
