  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With a new school year in full swing, many families across New York City are experiencing a time of transition. Whether it’s the first day of kindergarten, a return to middle or high school, or simply the shift from summer vacation, this season can bring a mix of excitement, anxiety, and uncertainty.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For those already experiencing emotional, developmental, or behavioral challenges, the return to school isn’t just about new routines. It often means navigating systems that don’t listen, don’t see, or don’t serve them well. That’s where Vibrant’s </span><b>Family and Youth Peer Support Services (FYPS)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> comes in.</span></p>

  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FYPS offers free community-embedded support for NYC families and young people (up to age 24), which includes helping navigate school systems, special education services, Administration for Children’s Services orders, and beyond. The team is made up of Peer Advocates: people who experienced the very systems we now help others navigate so they don’t have to face challenges alone.</span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September 2025, Vibrant celebrated the grand opening of a Staten Island site. Located just a block from the ferry, FYPS is a space where neighbors, partners, and families can come together to celebrate community pride, connection, and the belief that everyone deserves to be seen and supported. </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The grand opening celebration drew proclamations from New York State Senator Jessica Scarcella-Spanton and New York City Council member Kamilah Hanks, along with community partners, families, and local leaders. </span></p>
  <p><b>“I’m so honored to support and recognize the outstanding service to our great city and state, and for the great contributions that FYPS is bringing to our community,” said </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Senator Scarcella-Spanton. </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Program Director Jacqueline Jenkins, those contributions feel personal and familiar. </span><b>“We are just like one another,”</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> she said. </span><b>“We have navigated these specific systems ourselves.
