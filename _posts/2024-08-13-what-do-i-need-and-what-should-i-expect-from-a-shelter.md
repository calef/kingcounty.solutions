original_content: "There are many reasons people need to find shelters; for example,
  if you are leaving a domestic violence situation as described in our blog post “[How
  and When to Leave an Abusive Situation](https://www.crisisconnections.org/how-and-when-to-leave-an-abusive-situation/)”.
  If you are a person who is houseless or is experiencing homelessness, it can be
  overwhelming to figure out how to meet your basic needs. We are here to help make
  that process more approachable.\n\n**What kinds of programs are there?**  \nThere
  are a few main housing/shelter options for individuals and families experiencing
  homelessness:\n\n**Emergency Shelters**\n\n- Intended for short term support and
  operates night-by-night, though most allow occupants to stay as long as they need
  to.\n- Some emergency shelters are specifically set up for those experiencing domestic
  violence. These are at confidential locations and may have additional support services.\n\n**Transitional
  Housing**\n\n- Intended to allow individuals experiencing homelessness to stay for
  up to two years.\n- Often focuses on specific demographics (e.g. youth, veterans,
  disabled individuals, etc.)\n\n**Rapid Re-Housing (RRH)**\n\n- Intended to help
  people return to permanent housing.\n- Short-term rental help and voluntary services
  tailored to an individuals’ needs.\n- There will sometimes be rules about employment,
  income, criminal records, sobriety, etc. We can help you identify what those expectations
  are.\n\n**Permanent Supportive Housing**\n\n- Indefinite length of stay.\n- Prioritizes
  people who need comprehensive support services to maintain housing situations by
  limiting the barriers to accessing that support.\n\nIf you want to know more about
  the other options call 211 or review our comprehensive statewide database any time
  at [www.search.wa211.org](http://www.search.wa211.org). [For People Experiencing
  Homelessness – KCRHA](https://kcrha.org/resources/for-people-experiencing-homelessness/)
  is a page by King County Regional Homelessness Authority that has more resources
  and helplines.\n\n**How do I find programs near me?**  \nThere are a couple ways
  to find programs near you, you can use the United States Department of Housing and
  Urban Development’s locator tool via [HUD Resource Locator](https://resources.hud.gov/).\n\n![](https://www.crisisconnections.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/HUD-Resource-Locator-Image-1.png)\n\n&nbsp;If
  you need help finding a place to sleep for the night, calling 211 or using their
  [search engine](https://search.wa211.org/) to look for shelters near you is a great
  first step! They can help you find the best fit for you and your family.\n\n![](https://www.crisisconnections.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/211-Database.png)\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  Both resources will help you figure out the best way to reach out to the provider
  (i.e. the shelter/program you would like to use). If you’re struggling with understanding
  how to reach out, or knowing what programs to reach out to, call 211 and we can
  walk you through the process.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  If you are looking to find housing resources in King County, [Coordinated Entry
  through KCRHA](https://kcrha.org/resources/about-coordinated-entry/) can help you
  find the right place to ask about housing programs and get assessed.\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
  If you are aged 12–21, the [National Runaway Safeline | National Runaway Safeline
  (1800runaway.org)](https://www.1800runaway.org/) is a 24/7 crisis line set up to
  help you develop a plan and support you in finding resources; you can call, chat,
  text, email, or engage with a forum on their site. Their phone number is 1-800-RUNAWAY
  (1-800-786-2929).\n\nWhat do I do once I have found a place? &nbsp;\n\nOnce you
  have found some options that you are eligible for, reach out to each shelter to
  see if they have availability that night, usually by calling them. Each shelter
  will have their own individual process, which may include an assessment for:&nbsp;\n\n-
  Mental/physical health\n- Current living situation\n- If there are any children
  needing assistance\n- Income\n- Criminal history\n\nIf there is no availability
  when you call, some agencies may maintain a waitlist. It is always a good idea to
  ask when the best time to call back and check again as availability frequently fluctuates.&nbsp;\n\nYou’re
  not alone. We’re here to support you. If you have any resource questions, please
  call 211 (Monday – Friday, 9am-5pm). For mental health support call 988 (text and
  phoneline available 24/7).\n\nThe post [What do I need and what should I expect

Hemergency shelters, transitional housing, rapid re-housing, and permanent supportive housing are primary housing/shelter options for the homeless. Emergency shelters are typically for short-term support, while transitional housing allows for a stay of up to two years. Rapid re-housing helps people return to permanent housing, and permanent supportive housing provides indefinite stay for those needing comprehensive support services. Resources like the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development’s locator tool and 211 can help find nearby programs. Once a suitable place is found, individuals need to contact the shelter for availability and possibly undergo an assessment. If full, some shelters maintain a waitlist.
