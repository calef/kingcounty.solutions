Grooming is a manipulative process where an individual is led into isolation and dependence on the groomer, resulting in potential serious harm. The process consists of six stages. 

In Stage One, the groomer targets vulnerable individuals, such as those experiencing family issues or loneliness. In Stage Two, the groomer gains the victim's trust through seemingly friendly gestures and personal discussions. Stage Three involves fostering dependency by providing financial or emotional support, making the victim reliant on the groomer.

During Stage Four, the groomer isolates the victim from their support network, often portraying family and friends as harmful. Stage Five marks the beginning of abuse, which can manifest in various forms, with the victim still feeling a connection to the abuser and not recognizing the situation as abuse. 

Finally, in Stage Six, the groomer maintains the relationship through gaslighting and emotional manipulation, making the victim feel guilty for confronting them. Victims often doubt themselves, believing they are at fault. Grooming is a complex form of abuse that can affect anyone, and it’s crucial for victims to seek help and recognize the manipulation involved.
