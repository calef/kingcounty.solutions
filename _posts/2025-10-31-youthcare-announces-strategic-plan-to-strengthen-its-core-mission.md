YouthCare has announced a strategic plan aimed at enhancing its core mission of providing critical support to youth experiencing homelessness. Following a comprehensive review of its operations, the organization is refocusing on direct service delivery while ensuring long-term sustainability. Key initiatives include maintaining current shelter bed availability, divesting from underutilized properties, and centralizing case management to improve service accessibility. YouthCare aims to strengthen partnerships for workforce development and housing access, ensuring youth receive the necessary support as they seek economic opportunities.

Additionally, the organization has made the difficult decision to reduce its staff size to optimize operations, while prioritizing the dignity and resources for those transitioning out. YouthCare emphasizes aligning its resources with the needs expressed by the youth it serves, including the demand for increased housing resources and expanded mental health services. Through these changes, YouthCare reaffirms its commitment to being a stable source of care and connection for young people. The organization continues to seek community involvement and donations to support its mission, striving for a future where no young person experiences homelessness.
