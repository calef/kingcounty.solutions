Her journey includes leading grassroots initiatives at Syracuse University and advocating for immigrant rights, social housing, and support for working families in Seattle. Prior to her role on the City Council, Rinck contributed to regional policy at the King County Regional Homelessness Authority and provided essential services during the COVID-19 pandemic. She is committed to fostering community-driven solutions that prioritize the needs of working families and immigrant communities.
