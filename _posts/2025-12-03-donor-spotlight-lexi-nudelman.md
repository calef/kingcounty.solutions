  <h2><strong>Donor Spotlight: Lexi Nudelman &#8211; A Legacy of Care</strong></h2>
  <h3>ADMIRATION BECOMES A CALLING</h3>
  <p>Growing up, Alexa (Lexi) Nudelman looked up to her grandfather, Dr. Phil Nudelman, with awe and admiration. As one of the founders of YES in 1969, Dr. Nudelman dedicated his life to helping young people overcome substance use and other challenges that few were equipped to address at the time.</p>
  <blockquote><p>“That’s something my grandfather has always had a strength for, seeing a need and meeting it. He’s one of the kindest and wisest people I know, and he’s instilled in our family this belief that if you can help, you should,” shared Lexi.</p></blockquote>
  <p>That philosophy became a guiding light for Lexi. She began her studies in healthcare, driven by the same desire to care for others, which led her to behavioral health and, eventually, to her career as a therapist, filling the very need her grandfather recognized so many years ago. The deep connection to family and service ultimately led her to YES.</p>
  <h3>THE FRONT LINES OF YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH</h3>
  <p>Drawing from both her grandfather’s legacy and her own professional path, Lexi found herself deeply aligned with the mission of YES.</p>
  <blockquote><p>“It’s been such a powerful experience to serve on the Board of an organization my grandfather helped start.”</p></blockquote>
  <p>Before establishing her private practice, Lexi worked as a crisis counselor in a pediatric emergency room, where she saw the realities of youth mental health up close, especially during the pandemic. She recognized the high need for mental health care for our youth, seeing anxiety, depression, isolation, suicidal ideation, and substance use every day.</p>
  <blockquote><p>“Kids can go through so much and still come out on the other side so strong,” she said. “Their resilience is incredible, and it’s why mental health care for children and teens is so valuable.”</p></blockquote>
  <p>Now, as a therapist in private practice, Lexi uses that experience to bring both empathy and expertise to her role on the YES Board of Trustees for the past three years.</p>
  <h3>INSPIRATION THROUGH STORIES OF HOPE</h3>
  <p>One thing Lexi missed while working in the ER was seeing what came after: the recovery, the growth, the stories of hope. At YES, she’s found that closure and joy in hearing the success stories shared by clients and counselors.</p>
  <p>Attending YES&#8217; annual Invest in Youth Breakfast events and community Board meetings have become especially meaningful for her.</p>
  <h3>CARRYING A VISION OF HOPE</h3>
  <p>As both a therapist and a Board member, Lexi carries forward her grandfather’s belief in showing up for the community.</p>
  <blockquote><p>“The world we live in is really hard right now,” she reflected. “Keeping the conversation about mental health alive, being open and available to kids in your community, and finding ways to give back, those things matter so much.”</p></blockquote>
  <p>She encourages others to get involved in whatever way they can, by donating, mentoring, or volunteering.</p>
  <p>When asked what her grandfather might think of YES today, Lexi said,</p>
  <blockquote><p>“Every year he attends the Invest in Youth Breakfast, he’s just amazed, like, ‘Wow, there are so many people in this room.’ But his attitude is always, let’s keep going. How many more kids can we reach?”</p></blockquote>
  <p>And with Lexi now carrying that vision forward, one thing is certain: Dr. Nudelman’s legacy of compassion will continue to grow even further.</p>

  ## **Donor Spotlight: Lexi Nudelman – A Legacy of Care**

  ### ADMIRATION BECOMES A CALLING

  Growing up, Alexa (Lexi) Nudelman looked up to her grandfather, Dr. Phil Nudelman, with awe and admiration. As one of the founders of YES in 1969, Dr. Nudelman dedicated his life to helping young people overcome substance use and other challenges that few were equipped to address at the time.

  > “That’s something my grandfather has always had a strength for, seeing a need and meeting it. He’s one of the kindest and wisest people I know, and he’s instilled in our family this belief that if you can help, you should,” shared Lexi.

  That philosophy became a guiding light for Lexi. She began her studies in healthcare, driven by the same desire to care for others, which led her to behavioral health and, eventually, to her career as a therapist, filling the very need her grandfather recognized so many years ago. The deep connection to family and service ultimately led her to YES.

  ### THE FRONT LINES OF YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH

  Drawing from both her grandfather’s legacy and her own professional path, Lexi found herself deeply aligned with the mission of YES.

  > “It’s been such a powerful experience to serve on the Board of an organization my grandfather helped start.”

  Before establishing her private practice, Lexi worked as a crisis counselor in a pediatric emergency room, where she saw the realities of youth mental health up close, especially during the pandemic. She recognized the high need for mental health care for our youth, seeing anxiety, depression, isolation, suicidal ideation, and substance use every day.

  > “Kids can go through so much and still come out on the other side so strong,” she said. “Their resilience is incredible, and it’s why mental health care for children and teens is so valuable.”

  Now, as a therapist in private practice, Lexi uses that experience to bring both empathy and expertise to her role on the YES Board of Trustees for the past three years.

  ### INSPIRATION THROUGH STORIES OF HOPE

  One thing Lexi missed while working in the ER was seeing what came after: the recovery, the growth, the stories of hope. At YES, she’s found that closure and joy in hearing the success stories shared by clients and counselors.

  Attending YES’ annual Invest in Youth Breakfast events and community Board meetings have become especially meaningful for her.

  ### CARRYING A VISION OF HOPE

  As both a therapist and a Board member, Lexi carries forward her grandfather’s belief in showing up for the community.

  > “The world we live in is really hard right now,” she reflected. “Keeping the conversation about mental health alive, being open and available to kids in your community, and finding ways to give back, those things matter so much.”

  She encourages others to get involved in whatever way they can, by donating, mentoring, or volunteering.

  And with Lexi now carrying that vision forward, one thing is certain: Dr. Nudelman’s legacy of compassion will continue to grow even further.
