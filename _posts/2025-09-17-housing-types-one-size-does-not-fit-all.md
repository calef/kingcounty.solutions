Individuals and families experiencing homelessness have diverse backgrounds and unique needs that require varied solutions. The 2024 Point-in-Time Count in King County indicated that 16,868 individuals were homeless, including 3,701 from family units. Among these individuals, 47% faced substance use disorders, and 37% had serious mental illnesses. Addressing the complexities of homelessness necessitates a range of resources.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) defines several housing solutions: Emergency Shelters (ES) provide temporary shelter and can vary from congregate shelters to low-barrier options for specific populations. Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH) offers long-term housing assistance and services, requiring clients to have a disability. Rapid Re-Housing (RRH) assists individuals in quickly transitioning to permanent housing through financial support. Transitional Housing Programs (TH) offer temporary accommodations with supportive services for up to 24 months, such as tiny home villages. Other permanent housing options do not require a disability and include programs like Section 8 housing vouchers.

While these resources exist in King County, more are necessary to effectively combat the homelessness crisis and expand access to affordable housing.
