  <p class="">Recently, the shelter endeavored to transition&nbsp;from a cold-weather emergency shelter to a year-round overnight facility. Although it would be wonderful to be able to offer this longer-term solution to our&nbsp;unhoused&nbsp;neighbors, this change proved to be unworkable with our current financial situation. Here&#8217;s a statement from Keith about the latest changes to the shelter schedule:</p>



  <blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
  <p class="">&#8220;I want to thank all the people who have helped us on a continuous basis. As you know, Westside Neighbors Shelter typically offers cold-weather emergency overnight stays on cots in the Legion Hall auditorium from November through March. A few weeks ago, out of an abundance of compassion for those in need, we decided not to eliminate overnights once the weather grew warmer. We continued to offer breakfast, dinner, and overnight stays for 40 people.</p>



  <p class="">&#8220;However, with the new political reality and economic uncertainty in our country, donations to us and other organizations have dropped while the number of people who need help has grown. We found our resources so rapidly depleted that we realized we can’t afford to run the shelter full-time right now. For the survival of the shelter, we must return to our original model:&nbsp;<strong>starting Saturday, April 19, the shelter will once again function as a Warm Up Center only</strong>, 7 am to 11 am every day, including a hot breakfast.</p>



  <p class="">&#8220;So many of our clients stop by my office each day and say, “Thank you for what you’re doing for us.” Our goal is to someday provide services year-round, full-time, to our neighbors who need help with basic day-to-day living. I am determined to make this a reality, with help from donors and volunteers who want to make a difference.&#8221;</p>

Westside Neighbors Shelter has announced a return to its original operation model due to financial constraints. Initially, the shelter aimed to transition from a cold-weather emergency facility to a year-round overnight service. However, a decline in donations amidst rising demand for assistance has made this shift unfeasible. Starting April 19, the shelter will operate as a Warm Up Center from 7 am to 11 am daily, providing hot breakfasts but not overnight stays. This decision was made to ensure the shelter's survival during challenging economic times. Despite the setback, the shelter's leadership remains committed to eventually offering full-time services to support those in need. They are grateful for the continued support from the community and hope to expand their services in the future with the help of donors and volunteers.
