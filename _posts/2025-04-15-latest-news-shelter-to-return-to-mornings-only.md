Westside Neighbors Shelter has announced a return to its original operation model due to financial constraints. Initially, the shelter aimed to transition from a cold-weather emergency facility to a year-round overnight service. However, a decline in donations amidst rising demand for assistance has made this shift unfeasible. Starting April 19, the shelter will operate as a Warm Up Center from 7 am to 11 am daily, providing hot breakfasts but not overnight stays. This decision was made to ensure the shelter's survival during challenging economic times. Despite the setback, the shelter's leadership remains committed to eventually offering full-time services to support those in need. They are grateful for the continued support from the community and hope to expand their services in the future with the help of donors and volunteers.
