Midday service on the King County Water Taxi to Vashon Island will continue through June 2027, following funding secured in the state transportation budget adopted on May 20. The midday sailings, first introduced in July 2024, have led to a 55% increase in ridership, averaging 3,500 riders each month. King County Executive Shannon Braddock, alongside state Sen. Emily Alvarado and County Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda, emphasized the importance of this service for island residents, providing crucial connections to healthcare and local businesses. The Water Taxi operates 10 round trips daily between Vashon’s North-End Ferry Terminal and downtown Seattle's Pier 50, with annual costs around $2.5 million. This funding ensures the maintenance of four midday round-trip sailings, which are vital for the public health and economy of Vashon. Additionally, King County Metro will enhance bus frequency on Vashon, linking routes to the Water Taxi and Washington State Ferries. The Water Taxi fare is $6.75 for adults, with discounts available for seniors and low-income passengers, and free rides for those 18 and under. Local advocacy and partnerships have been key in securing this essential service for the community.
