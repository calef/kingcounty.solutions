Bellevue will celebrate the graduation of the 2025 Bellevue Essentials class, an introductory civic engagement program, on November 19 from 7-9 p.m. at City Hall. The event will feature a keynote address by Kevin P. Henry, former leader of the city’s diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. In his speech titled "The True Leader in All of Us," Henry will motivate the 36 graduates by sharing his experiences in community building and insights on leadership and belonging. Over his 20-year career with the city, Henry played a key role in shaping Bellevue's diversity and inclusion efforts, including launching the "Voices of Diversity" radio program. The ceremony is open to the public, allowing community members to learn more about the Bellevue Essentials program, which has engaged over 400 residents in civic learning over the past 13 years. Class speaker Cosmos Darwin, a product manager at Microsoft and Bellevue resident since 2015, will also share his experiences. The next Bellevue Essentials class will begin in September 2026, with applications opening in spring 2026.
