On February 25, 2025, Imagine Housing conducted a virtual convening regarding the proposed development, The Approach at Kenmore, addressing community questions. The event included discussions on various topics, including volunteer opportunities with Habitat for Humanity for residents with disabilities, data on income brackets in Kenmore, and the long-term urban design vision for the 181st Street corridor. 

Participants inquired about environmental building standards, with Imagine Housing confirming compliance with the Evergreen Sustainable Development Standard, which includes energy efficiency and eco-friendly requirements. Applications for housing will be available online, following a first-come, first-served basis for eligible applicants. 

The background check process was clarified, noting that applicants are not automatically denied based on criminal history; it is considered on a case-by-case basis. The project aims to include family-oriented two- and three-bedroom units, with a maximum occupancy of 299 people across 121 units. Additionally, community support is emphasized as vital for expediting the project’s timeline, which is complex and involves multiple funding partners.
