At 48, Abby approached her first mammogram as just another item on her to-do list, not anticipating the life-changing diagnosis of breast cancer. Following a lumpectomy and radiation treatment in 2023, she began taking hormone-blocking medication while remaining active through tennis. Almost a year later, she learned about Cancer Lifeline from a yoga teacher's comment and discovered a wealth of high-quality, free programs that provided support and community. Abby joined classes where she felt safe and encouraged to learn, realizing that 85% of breast cancers are caused by random cell mutations rather than family history. This knowledge alleviated her guilt about not screening sooner. Among her most impactful experiences at Cancer Lifeline were Yoga Nidra, which offered deep rest, and Visual Journaling for Self-Discovery, where she explored her identity and found clarity. Abby's journey transformed from a routine task into a profound exploration of self and community support. She expresses gratitude to Cancer Lifeline for helping her process the last two years of her life in meaningful ways.
