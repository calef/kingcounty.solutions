Mohit and Ojaswani Suley have transformed their annual Diwali celebration in Seattle into a significant fundraiser for families experiencing homelessness at Mary’s Place. Four years ago, they decided to enhance the festival of lights by combining their cultural celebration with community giving. Inspired by Mary’s Place’s mission to ensure no child sleeps outside, the Suleys, both Microsoft employees, learned about the organization during Microsoft’s GIVE Month. They wanted to make a difference in their local community, stating that change begins at home.

This year, their Diwali fundraiser raised an impressive $14,000 before corporate matching, directly aiding families in King County in finding safety and stability as winter approaches. Mohit reflects on Diwali as a time for gratitude and a reminder to share their good fortune with others. The Suleys exemplify the spirit of giving, showing that by illuminating their community, they can help make the world a brighter place for everyone.
