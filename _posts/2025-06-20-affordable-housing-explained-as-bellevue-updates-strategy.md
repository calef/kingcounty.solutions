The City of Bellevue is in the process of updating its Affordable Housing Strategy throughout 2025. To foster community engagement, the Office of Housing has produced three informative videos covering the fundamentals of affordable housing: defining affordable housing, assessing housing needs in Bellevue, and explaining how the updated strategy will assist in addressing these needs. The new strategy builds on the 2017 Affordable Housing Strategy, aiming to facilitate access to affordable housing options in the city. Community involvement has been strong, with hundreds of residents and organizational partners participating in various events and online outreach from January to April. Feedback gathered during this engagement is documented in the 2025 AHS Phase 1 Engagement report. Residents are encouraged to continue their involvement through the EngagingBellevue.com platform and share their personal housing stories to highlight the importance of this issue.
