Sue Thacker has been recognized as the Federal Way Mirror’s Hometown Hero for September 2025 due to her transformative work at the Federal Way Senior Center food bank. Leveraging her background as a former production manager, Thacker introduced significant improvements in efficiency, safety, and process management. These enhancements have reduced the wait time for food bank recipients from as long as two hours to approximately one and a half minutes. As a result, the food bank is now able to serve over 120 families daily, a substantial increase from the previous capacity of 70 to 80 families. Additionally, her efforts have contributed to a decrease in the number of volunteers required to operate the food bank effectively.
