title: City adopts Newport and Crossroads neighborhood plans
topics: []
---

The City Council of Bellevue has adopted updated neighborhood plans for the Newport and Crossroads areas, concluding a 15-month community engagement process. These plans, part of the Great Neighborhoods program, aim to provide a community-informed vision for each of Bellevue's neighborhoods. Mayor Lynne Robinson highlighted that while Newport and Crossroads have distinct identities, they share similar priorities, and the tailored solutions reflect their unique characters while adhering to citywide goals. The council reviewed these updates following a recommendation from the Planning Commission earlier in the summer.

The neighborhood plans are integral to Bellevue’s Comprehensive Plan, which addresses various policies related to housing, transportation, and sustainability over the next two decades. The Great Neighborhoods program, initiated in 2018, updates two neighborhood plans each year to meet anticipated growth and incorporate community input. Future updates include Eastgate and Factoria in 2026, Lake Hills and West Lake Sammamish in 2027, and West Bellevue and Woodridge in 2028. Additionally, the downtown area has been redesignated as a Metropolitan Regional Center, recognizing its significance as an economic hub and aiding in securing federal transportation funding.
