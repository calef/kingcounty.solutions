title: How to Drop Your Doomscroll Habit
topics: []

Doomscrolling, or continuously scrolling through negative news, can increase anxiety and stress. To combat this habit, set boundaries around media consumption by designating specific times for checking news and social media. Engage in activities that promote well-being, such as exercise, reading, or hobbies that distract from screens. Practice mindfulness and focus on the present moment to reduce feelings of overwhelm. Curate your news sources to include positive or constructive content, which can help balance the negativity. Additionally, consider taking regular breaks from digital devices to reconnect with the real world. Surround yourself with supportive people and engage in conversations that uplift rather than contribute to anxiety. Implementing these strategies can help break the cycle of doomscrolling and foster a healthier relationship with media.
