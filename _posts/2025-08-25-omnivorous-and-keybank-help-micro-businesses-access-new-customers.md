  <p>This September, Community Roots Housing is hosting <a href="https://communityrootshousing.org/events/omnivorous/">Omnivorous</a>, our annual tasting benefit celebrating Seattle’s vibrant food scene. The event brings together local bars, bakeries, distilleries, pop-ups, and beloved neighborhood staples to support affordable housing.</p>
  <h4>A look at the small food businesses that are making Omnivorous possible</h4>
  <p>If you have attended before, you know it is the talented food entrepreneurs who bring the event to life. This year, <strong>the majority of our <a href="https://communityrootshousing.org/events/omnivorous/#restaurants">restaurants</a> are considered <a href="https://www.wamicrobiz.org/what-is-a-microbusiness" target="_blank" rel="noopener">micro-businesses</a>, meaning they have less than 6 employees.</strong> Over 90% are BIPOC and women-owned. Whether they operate a brick-and-mortar space or serve customers through food trucks or pop-ups, these small businesses and their founders help shape the character of our neighborhoods.</p>
  <p>For some, the connection to our mission is deeply personal. There are vendors who are also Community Roots residents. One told us, “Participating as a business owner is a reminder that the journey of entrepreneurship is possible. Affordable housing gives me the opportunity to pursue my dreams and build a legacy while maintaining the ability to have a safe space to live and be.”</p>

  <p>This year, <a href="https://www.key.com/personal/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KeyBank</a> is helping make that connection even stronger. Thanks to their generous sponsorship, <strong>each of the Omnivorous restaurant vendors are receiving $700 stipends to offset the costs of ingredients, staffing, transportation, and equipment to participate.</strong> Their sponsorship enables microbusinesses to use this event as an opportunity to access new markets. Vendors get free advertising and marketing, professional photography, social media promotion, and exposure to hundreds of guests. For businesses without a physical space, it is a unique chance to showcase their work and support a good cause.</p>
  <h4>Affordable housing supports small businesses</h4>
  <p>At Community Roots, we believe housing stability and small business success go hand in hand. As one past restaurant partners shared, “Affordable housing ensures that a more realistic representation of our community can have the same access to local, micro, and diverse businesses like ours.” Housing affordability supports the employee base that keeps these businesses alive.</p>
  <p>Omnivorous is a celebration of the people, cultures, and creativity that make Seattle special. It is a reminder that everyone should be able to live, work, and grow here. <strong>Join us to taste a bite of Seattle’s diverse food scene and get to know the people that make it possible</strong>—all while building a community that is accessible and affordable to all.</p>

Community Roots Housing is hosting Omnivorous, an annual tasting benefit in September that celebrates Seattle's food scene while supporting affordable housing. The event features local bars, bakeries, distilleries, and food vendors, with a majority being micro-businesses that employ fewer than six people. Over 90% of the vendors are BIPOC and women-owned, contributing to the neighborhood's character. Some vendors are also Community Roots residents, highlighting the personal connection to the mission of affordable housing. KeyBank sponsors this year’s event, providing each vendor with a $700 stipend to help cover costs associated with participation. This support allows micro-businesses to access new markets and gain valuable exposure through marketing and professional photography. Community Roots emphasizes the link between housing stability and small business success, noting that affordable housing helps create a diverse and accessible community. Omnivorous showcases the cultural richness of Seattle's food scene and fosters connections among residents, emphasizing the importance of making the community a place where everyone can thrive.
