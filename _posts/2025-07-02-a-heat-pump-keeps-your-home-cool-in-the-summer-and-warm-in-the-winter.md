  Smart Eastside Helps people get heat pumps, providing an essential, energy-efficient
  resource&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nAlthough it’s not summertime just yet, temperatures across
  the Seattle area are [heating up](https://www.axios.com/local/seattle/2025/03/03/climate-change-spring-temperatures-washington).
  Warm weather is here, and even hotter days are coming. The last few years have seen
  an increase in extreme heat events across King County leading to more [hospitalizations
  for heat-related illness](https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/dph/about-king-county/about-public-health/data-reports/climate/heat-related-illness)
  and even death, including the 2021 heat dome event.&nbsp;\n\nThese extreme weather
  events disproportionately affect lower-income households, children and older adults,
  people with underlying health conditions, people with disabilities, and homes without
  air conditioning or access to cooling resources.\n\nSomething that can make a significant
  difference is a [heat pump](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcnJ_SBgU6M&t=44s).
  A heat pump is made of two components (one unit outside and one inside) that moves
  heat out of your home in the summer and into your home in the winter.\n\n[What Are

  **Heat pumps offer other benefits like:&nbsp;**\n\n- Filtering and purifying the
  air (great for smoke season)\n\n- Dehumidifying\n\n- Potentially reducing electric
  bills\n\nDifferent from a furnace or boiler, a heat pump doesn’t generate heat,
  it reallocates the heat, making this all-electric system a smarter carbon-free choice.\n\n[Energy
  Smart Eastside](https://www.energysmarteastside.org/), in collaboration with Hopelink,
  makes energy-efficient heat pumps accessible to low-income households in north and
  east King County. The program offers qualified homeowners with gas, oil, or wood
  heat the opportunity to apply to receive a free heat pump, which is administered
  by [Hopelink’s Energy Assistance program](https://www.hopelink.org/programs/energy/).\n\n![Hopelink

  Smart Eastside is a climate initiative of the East Side Climate Partnership that
  includes the cities of Bellevue, Issaquah, Kirkland, Mercer Island, Redmond, and
  Sammamish. This initiative is possible through a combination of former President
  Biden’s Climate Initiative Act, and former Governor Inslee’s work to increase energy
  sustainability and electrification work in Washington State. It’s a win for both
  Eastside residents and broader climate sustainability goals.\n\n“This model of neighboring
  cities coming together and partnering with Hopelink as the community-based organization
  that has the infrastructure to support initiatives like this is a best practice
  model,” said Lucy Pyeatt, Hopelink Director of Energy Programs. “As the cities go
  to national conferences and are sharing this work, we anticipate it being adopted
  elsewhere, and that’s been the key to receiving grants to fund this initiative.”\n\n####
  Since its inception, Energy Smart Eastside has:&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n- Installed over
  490 heat pumps\n\n- 69% of those homes with head pumps are low or moderate income\n\n-
  Averted over 2,000 metric tons of CO₂, with an estimated 23,000 tons averted over
  the lifetime of the heat pumps\n\n“I am so grateful Hopelink arranged the installation
  of the heat pump,” said Shahla, a Hopelink client and recipient from the program.
  “The project moved smoothly, the crew were very professional and pleasant to work
  with, and they finished the job on time. Since then, my home has a perfect temperature
  and has kept my family cool this summer.”\n\n[Eastside residents are enjoying heating

  Smart Eastside’s future goals include broader accessibility to energy-efficient
  solutions and continued adaptation to evolving community needs. Education remains
  a cornerstone, with ongoing efforts to address knowledge gaps and optimize the use
  of heat pumps during varying climate conditions.\n\nCatherine Stroughter, Hopelink
  Energy Program Resource Specialist, is a key coordinator of the program. She works
  with clients through outreach, helps them navigate eligibility requirements, coordinates
  with contractors, and more. “A lot of folks are in disbelief that this is free,”
  Stroughter said. “[They ask] ‘Am I going to have to pay something later?’ And I
  say, ‘Nope, this is completely covered.’”\n\nStroughter said the program is “definitely
  a blessing” for some clients who worry about the cost of repairing or replacing
  an aging furnace. In addition to keeping a house cool in the summer and warm in
  the winter, replacing an old gas furnace with a heat pump also adds value to the
  home. “If anybody had the opportunity to be a part of Energy Smart Eastside, I would
  say, ‘Don’t walk, run,’ and get that.\n\n“Catherine’s warmth and deep experience
  supporting our clients has been incredibly valuable,” said Daniela Romo, Hopelink
  Energy Program Senior Manager. “Her ability to educate and guide clients through
  the process has helped us build trust through the installation process, especially
  with our more vulnerable populations.”\n\n“One thing many clients don’t initially
  realize is that heat pumps provide both heating and cooling,” Romo added. “We want
  to make sure they feel confident using their systems in a way that balances comfort
  and cost. Because our program also administers [LIHEAP](https://acf.gov/ocs/programs/liheap)
  and [PSE HELP](https://www.pse.com/en/Customer-Service/help-center/assistance-programs)
  able to offer a well-rounded, one-stop service that helps clients both upgrade their
  systems and manage their ongoing energy costs.”\n\nTo find out if getting a heat

The Energy Smart Eastside initiative, in collaboration with Hopelink, is providing energy-efficient heat pumps to low-income households in north and east King County. Heat pumps, which are carbon-free and can help reduce electric bills, relocate heat out of homes in the summer and into homes in the winter. The initiative is part of efforts by local cities and the East Side Climate Partnership to increase energy sustainability, and is supported by former President Biden's Climate Initiative Act and former Governor Inslee's electrification work. Since its inception, the program has installed over 490 heat pumps, averting over 2,000 metric tons of CO₂.
