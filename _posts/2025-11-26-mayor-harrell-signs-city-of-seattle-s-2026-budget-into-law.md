Mayor Bruce Harrell signed the City of Seattle's 2026 budget into law, amounting to $8.9 billion, with $2.0 billion allocated for General Fund priorities. The budget, which passed unanimously by the City Council, emphasizes significant investments in affordable housing, public safety, and essential services. Key initiatives include a record $349.5 million for affordable housing, $228.5 million for homelessness response, and $53.2 million to enhance food access. The budget also renews the Families, Education, Preschool, and Promise (FEPP) levy, committing $1.3 billion over six years to support youth and families, and includes Proposition 2, which offers tax relief for small businesses while raising $81 million for essential programs.

Mayor Harrell highlighted the budget's role in addressing federal uncertainties and ensuring local programs are protected, while also acknowledging the collaboration with the City Council. Notable allocations include funding for community crisis responders, small business support, immigrant services, and public safety enhancements. The budget also strengthens the City’s Rainy Day Fund for fiscal sustainability, ensuring resources are available for emergencies and fluctuations in revenue. This budget marks the first unanimous approval since 2013, reflecting a collective commitment to Seattle's values and priorities.
