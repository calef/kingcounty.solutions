Bill Block, a housing justice advocate, passed away in August 2023 after a long battle with cancer. He was a community leader dedicated to transforming systems to ensure dignity for all, particularly focusing on breaking the cycle of homelessness and creating more accessible housing options. His legacy inspires the Rainier Valley Food Bank (RVFB), which recently expanded its facilities to better serve the community. Bill’s wife, Sue Leavitt, has joined RVFB’s campaign to develop a new community food hub, emphasizing a mission to nourish, empower, and serve with compassion. This facility aims to be a welcoming, low-barrier space where individuals can access food and other resources. RVFB has launched a $350,000 matching challenge to honor Bill's contributions, with over $137,000 raised so far. The goal is to reach $200,000 by October 31 to secure the future of the food hub as a center of care and resilience. RVFB’s efforts reflect the systems-level approach that Bill championed, striving to create an environment where communities can thrive together. The ongoing campaign invites contributions to continue Bill Block's legacy of compassion and innovation in addressing hunger and housing issues.
