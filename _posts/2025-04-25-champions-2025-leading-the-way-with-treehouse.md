  CEO Dawn Rains gives speech at Champions 2025.\n\nOn April 1, 2025, 742 attendees
  joined Treehouse at Champions 2025, our annual fundraising event. Long-time supporters—like
  our keynote speaker Attorney General Nick Brown—and new faces gathered at the Sheraton
  Grand Seattle to hear what this year’s theme, “Leading the Way,” means for youth
  experiencing foster care and the community at large.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n### **What Does
  “Leading the Way” Mean?** &nbsp;\n\n“Leading the Way” is a multi-pronged call to
  action for everyone. When youth in foster care are empowered with proper support
  and resources, they are more than capable of leading the way toward the life of
  their dreams. But it takes all of us to get them there.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nFor youth
  experiencing foster care, it’s a reminder to believe in and bet on themselves. For
  Treehouse, it’s a promise to continue advocating for and _with_ youth in foster
  care, setting an example for systems change across the country. And for the wider
  community, it’s an invitation to join us in leading the way toward a more just world.&nbsp;\n\n

  Treehouse staff members attending Champions.\n\n### **Tree-mendous Work in Action**
  &nbsp;\n\nFour Treehouse direct-service staff members—including the event emcee,
  Jesse Becerra, who is known for Treehouse-themed puns—from across the organization
  and state shared stories from the field so guests could see what “Leading the Way”
  looks like in practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nEach staff member represented the various
  ways Treehouse supports youth—through long-term coaching, educational problem solving,
  and financial and material resources. Yet each story underscored the importance
  of consistency and patience in allowing the youth to stabilize, flourish, and take
  things from there.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n### **Committed to the Long Haul** &nbsp;\n\nCelebrating
  16 years at Treehouse, CEO Dawn Rains used her time on stage to address the challenges
  ahead and emphasize Treehouse’s firm dedication to students in foster care. She

On April 1, 2025, Treehouse hosted its annual fundraising event, Champions 2025, at the Sheraton Grand Seattle, attracting 742 attendees including keynote speaker Attorney General Nick Brown. The theme, “Leading the Way,” emphasizes empowering youth in foster care through support and resources, enabling them to pursue their dreams. Treehouse commits to advocating for these youth and invites the community to participate in fostering a more just world.

During the event, four Treehouse staff members shared field stories, demonstrating the practical application of “Leading the Way” through long-term coaching, educational assistance, and resource provision. CEO Dawn Rains, celebrating 16 years with Treehouse, addressed challenges ahead, including increased service demand and potential funding threats due to the Washington state budget crisis. Treehouse relies on state investment for 40% of its operating budget, with the remaining 60% coming from community support and fundraising.

Rains called for collective action and bold advocacy to continue supporting students in foster care. The event also recognized co-chairs Linda Spain and Terri Olson-Miller, along with sponsors and the Challenge Pool for their contributions, highlighting the community's essential role in this mission.
