  ## Slower speeds will support Vision Zero

  To improve safety for all users – including people walking and biking – Bellevue’s Transportation Department will lower speed limits on four Bellevue streets later this month. &nbsp;

  The speed limit on portions of 124th Avenue Southeast/Southeast 38th Street and Northup Way from Bellevue Way to 120th Avenue Northeast will be reduced from 35 to 25 mph; the speed limit on Village Park Drive and a portion of Northeast 40th Street will be reduced from 35 to 30 mph. &nbsp;

  These changes are part of Safe Speeds Bellevue, a new program to improve safety and support Vision Zero by evaluating speed limits and reducing speeds on city streets. The City Council approved the speed limit reductions on June 3. Transportation staff will update speed limit signs later this month. The new speed limits consider how the street is designed and used by people walking, rolling, bicycling and driving. &nbsp;

  City staff will study how people using these streets respond to the new speed limits and then use this data to inform future phases of the project. These streets were selected for initial speed reduction because they are near schools, along bike routes, and have been requested by residents—allowing evaluation of lower speed limits in a variety of contexts.

  Next, staff will review the speed limits on all streets in Bellevue that have a limit of 30 mph or more. Almost 90% of fatal and serious injury crashes happen on these streets even though they are only 25% of the total street network. &nbsp;

Slower speed limits will be implemented on four streets in Bellevue later this month to enhance safety for all road users, including pedestrians and cyclists. The speed limit on parts of 124th Avenue Southeast/Southeast 38th Street and Northup Way will be reduced from 35 mph to 25 mph. Additionally, speed limits on Village Park Drive and a section of Northeast 40th Street will drop from 35 mph to 30 mph. These changes are part of the Safe Speeds Bellevue initiative, which aims to evaluate and lower speed limits on city streets to support the Vision Zero goal of eliminating traffic deaths and serious injuries by 2030. The Bellevue City Council approved the new limits on June 3, and transportation staff will update signage later this month. The selected streets are near schools and bike routes and were chosen based on resident requests. The city plans to study the impact of these speed reductions and will also review speed limits on all streets with limits of 30 mph or higher. This initiative follows successful safety improvements seen in Bellevue, Seattle, and other U.S. cities, which have demonstrated the effectiveness of lower speed limits in reducing crashes and injuries. Input from the community will be sought later this summer.
