Slower speed limits will be implemented on four streets in Bellevue later this month to enhance safety for all road users, including pedestrians and cyclists. The speed limit on parts of 124th Avenue Southeast/Southeast 38th Street and Northup Way will be reduced from 35 mph to 25 mph. Additionally, speed limits on Village Park Drive and a section of Northeast 40th Street will drop from 35 mph to 30 mph. These changes are part of the Safe Speeds Bellevue initiative, which aims to evaluate and lower speed limits on city streets to support the Vision Zero goal of eliminating traffic deaths and serious injuries by 2030. The Bellevue City Council approved the new limits on June 3, and transportation staff will update signage later this month. The selected streets are near schools and bike routes and were chosen based on resident requests. The city plans to study the impact of these speed reductions and will also review speed limits on all streets with limits of 30 mph or higher. This initiative follows successful safety improvements seen in Bellevue, Seattle, and other U.S. cities, which have demonstrated the effectiveness of lower speed limits in reducing crashes and injuries. Input from the community will be sought later this summer.
