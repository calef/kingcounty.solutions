  <p><strong>Meet Chelon, a BrightSpark Champion</strong></p>



  <p>Chelon Jackson is the heart and soul of <em>Lovable Nest</em>, her in-home, family child-care center, where she has cared for children from birth through age 5 for <strong>over 30 years</strong>. Her love and commitment to the children she provides care for is immeasurable. Because of this, she has also worked tirelessly to increase the quality of her program, because she believes every child deserves the very best start.</p>



  <p>Through her partnership with BrightSpark, Chelon has accessed two powerful supports:</p>



  <ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li><strong>Early Learning Coaching:</strong> Through our one-on-one and group coaching, Chelon has navigated everything from curriculum development to licensing to business management. With the consistent encouragement of her coach, she pushed through doubts, <em>“we started the footwork … it took a while to get to a 5, but we did it together as a team.”</em> Her hard work paid off, she earned an <strong>Early Achievers Quality Level 5</strong>, the highest possible rating in Washington State’s quality-recognition system!</li>



  <li><strong>Seattle Preschool Program (SPP):</strong> For nearly a decade, Chelon has brought SPP’s nationally recognized preschool curriculum into Lovable Nest. BrightSpark’s SPP team supports her with specialized training, curriculum development, and tools to engage families. Chelon said it all came full circle:<em> “I could implement what I learned … so it all came together in a circle.”</em></li>
  </ul>



  <p>What really moves Chelon, though, is the&nbsp;<strong>connections</strong>&nbsp;she builds; with children, families, and her community. She beams when she talks about families who return years later, or kids who say hi and tell her how much they remember their time with her.</p>

  <p><strong>Why Stories Like Chelon’s Matter&#8230;<br>Especially on Giving Tuesday</strong></p>



  <p>This Giving Tuesday, you have the power to support&nbsp;<em>more&nbsp;</em>providers like Chelon in our community:</p>



  <ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li>Providers who want to elevate their care but don’t know where to start.</li>



  <li>Centers that lack the resources to reach their highest potential.</li>



  <li>Families whose children benefit daily from warm, skilled, and stable early learning.</li>
  </ul>



  <p>Financial gifts support our coaching programs, professional development, and specialized support, ensuring that providers, especially those serving under-resourced communities, have the tools and encouragement they need to succeed.</p>



  <p>In 2024 alone, BrightSpark’s coaching team supported&nbsp;<strong>over 2,390 Providers</strong>&nbsp;in King and Pierce Counties. The ripple effect of investing in providers is huge!</p>
