Jeff Moorhouse, a financial advisor from Ventura, California, has been recognized as one of three national finalists for the 2025 Invest in Others Volunteer of the Year Award. This honor acknowledges his significant contributions to Angel Flight West, a nonprofit that provides free air transportation for patients needing critical medical care. Since joining in 2016, Moorhouse has completed 62 missions, helping patients access essential medical appointments, particularly for cancer treatments. 

Moorhouse’s volunteer aviation journey began with Aeromedicos Santa Barbara, delivering healthcare to remote communities in Mexico. His leadership as Southern California Wing Leader has expanded Angel Flight West’s capabilities, including coordinating emergency flights after the 2018 Santa Barbara mudslides and establishing partnerships for veterans' medical transportation. 

Reflecting on his experiences, Moorhouse emphasizes the profound connections made through his flights, sharing impactful moments such as flying a cancer patient home after receiving life-changing news. His commitment to using aviation for humanitarian purposes highlights the mission of Angel Flight West, which has completed over 100,000 flights in its 40+ years of service, embodying the resilience of the human spirit and the power of community.
