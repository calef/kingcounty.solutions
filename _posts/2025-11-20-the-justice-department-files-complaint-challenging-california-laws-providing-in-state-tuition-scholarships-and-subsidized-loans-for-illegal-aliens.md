The U.S. Justice Department has filed a complaint against California laws that provide in-state tuition, scholarships, and subsidized loans to illegal aliens, claiming these laws discriminate against U.S. citizens who do not receive the same benefits. Attorney General Pamela Bondi stated that California is violating federal law by offering exclusive educational benefits to non-citizens, which incentivizes illegal immigration. The complaint targets the State of California, Governor Gavin Newsom, the State Attorney General, and the governing bodies of California's public universities and colleges, seeking to prevent enforcement of these laws. It specifically aims to stop the requirement for colleges to offer in-state tuition rates to all aliens maintaining California residency, regardless of their immigration status, and to block the California Dream Act, which allocates financial aid to illegal immigrants. This legal action follows recent executive orders signed by President Trump aimed at restricting taxpayer benefits for illegal aliens and is part of a broader series of lawsuits against California regarding immigration policies. Similar legal challenges have been filed in other states, including Texas and Minnesota.
