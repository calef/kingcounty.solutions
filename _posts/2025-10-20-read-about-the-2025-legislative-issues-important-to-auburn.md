The City of Auburn's elected leaders have expressed concerns regarding proposed tax measures, including a payroll excise tax and increased business and occupation tax on large businesses, arguing these could destabilize Washington's economy during challenging times. They emphasize the importance of job growth and economic competitiveness, warning that such taxes may lead businesses to relocate to states with lower costs and taxes. The letter encourages collaboration between local governments and the state to develop sustainable solutions to fiscal challenges, especially as communities face uncertainties related to recession risks.

Additionally, Auburn's legislative priorities for 2025 include addressing public safety, affordable housing needs, transportation funding, and the maintenance of parks and open spaces. The city advocates for comprehensive strategies to tackle interconnected issues, urging legislators to support funding for police staffing, affordable housing initiatives, and local infrastructure projects. Auburn's leaders also seek reforms to property tax caps and clarification on local tax laws to enhance financial stability. The city encourages residents to engage with their representatives to voice concerns over these critical issues affecting the community.
