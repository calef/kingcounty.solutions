A federal grand jury in Miami has indicted Congresswoman Sheila Cherfilus-McCormick and several co-defendants for stealing $5 million in FEMA disaster funds. The indictment alleges that Cherfilus-McCormick, 46, and her brother Edwin Cherfilus, 51, misappropriated these funds through a family health-care company's FEMA-funded COVID-19 vaccination staffing contract. They reportedly conspired to launder the stolen money, using a portion for campaign contributions to Cherfilus-McCormick's 2021 congressional bid and for personal gain.

Additionally, Cherfilus-McCormick and co-defendant Nadege Leblanc, 46, allegedly utilized straw donors to funnel further contributions, while Cherfilus-McCormick and her tax preparer David K. Spencer, 41, are charged with conspiring to file a false federal tax return by improperly claiming personal expenses as business deductions. If convicted, Cherfilus-McCormick could face up to 53 years in prison, with her co-defendants facing varying sentences. U.S. Attorney Jason A. Reding Quiñones emphasized the commitment to uphold the law and safeguard taxpayer money, stating that misuse of FEMA funds undermines public trust. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty.
