Hospitality House South King is launching a donation match campaign to encourage contributions to their cause. For a limited time, all donations made will be matched dollar for dollar, doubling the impact of each gift. This initiative aims to support the organization’s mission of providing essential services to those in need within the community. Donors are urged to take advantage of this opportunity to maximize their contributions and help more individuals and families facing hardships. The campaign emphasizes the importance of community support and the significant difference every donation can make during this matching period.
