CHS expresses deep gratitude to the Verdant Health Commission for their vital support following a fire that destroyed the Lynnwood office. Verdant's emergency funding and provision of interim office space have been instrumental in the recovery process. As a long-time partner, Verdant has significantly contributed to efforts aimed at improving access to mental health services in south Snohomish County. The Lynnwood location housed the Community-Based Intensive Services Department, which provides essential mental health services to families and youth. Thanks to community support and the resilience of staff, CHS has maintained uninterrupted services, ensuring clients receive continuous care. Verdant's generosity not only aids in rebuilding but also highlights a shared commitment to healing and community wellbeing. This collaboration underscores the importance of partnership in enhancing behavioral healthcare. CHS, on behalf of its staff, clients, and board of directors, extends heartfelt thanks to Verdant Health Commission for their unwavering support during this challenging time, ensuring that families continue to access the compassionate care they need.
