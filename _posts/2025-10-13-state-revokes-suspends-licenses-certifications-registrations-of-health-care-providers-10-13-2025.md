  <p><strong>OLYMPIA</strong> -- The Washington State Department of Health has revoked or suspended the licenses, certifications, or registrations of the following health care providers in our state. The department has also immediately suspended the credentials of people who have been prohibited from practicing in other states.</p>

  <p>The department’s Health Systems Quality Assurance Division works with boards, commissions and advisory committees to set licensing standards for more than 80 health care professions (e.g., dentists, nurses, counselors). Information about disciplinary action taken against medical doctors and physician assistants can be found on the <a href="http://www.wmc.wa.gov/">Washington Medical Commission (WMC) website</a>. Questions about WMC disciplinary actions can be sent to <a href="mailto:media@wmc.wa.gov">media@wmc.wa.gov</a>.</p>

  <p>Information about health care providers is on the agency’s website. <a name="_Hlk128486923">Click on “</a><a href="https://doh.wa.gov/licenses-permits-and-certificates/provider-credential-search">Health Care Provider Lookup</a>” under the “Find it Fast” section of the <a href="http://www.doh.wa.gov/Home.aspx">Department of Health website</a> (doh.wa.gov). The site includes information about a health care provider’s license status, the expiration and renewal date of their credential, disciplinary actions and copies of legal documents issued after July 1998. This information is also available by calling 360-236-4700. Consumers who think a health care provider acted unprofessionally are also encouraged to call and report their complaint.</p>

  <h2><strong>Kitsap County</strong></h2>

  <p>In September 2025 the Department of Health summarily suspended <strong>Shaun Clifton Stoops’s</strong> (NA60880258) registered nursing assistant credential pending further disciplinary action. In November 2024, the Department of Social and Health Services determined Stoop physically abused and improperly used restraints on a vulnerable adult and placed him on its long-term care abuse and neglect registry. Placement on the registry prohibits Stoop from working with or having unsupervised access to vulnerable adults.</p>

  <h2><strong>Kittitas County</strong></h2>

  <p>In September 2025 the Department of Health indefinitely suspended <strong>Kenny Duane Scribner’s</strong> (HM60849470) certified home care aide credential. In August 2024, Scribner was charged with one count of second degree-rape– particularly vulnerable victim and one count of indecent liberties – particularly vulnerable victim. Scribner has not responded to the department’s request for information.</p>

  <h2><strong>Thurston County</strong></h2>

  <p>In September 2025 the Department of Health summarily suspended <strong>Benjamin Philip Johnson’s </strong>(NA60992880) registered nursing assistant credential pending further disciplinary action. In May 2025, the Department of Social and Health Services determined Johnson financially abused a vulnerable adult and placed him on its long-term care abuse and neglect registry. Placement on the registry prohibits Johnson from working with or having unsupervised access to vulnerable adults.</p>

  <h2><strong>Out of State</strong></h2>

  <p><strong>Texas</strong>: In September 2025 the Board of Osteopathic Medicine and Surgery indefinitely suspended <strong>Aman Kanti Patel’s</strong> (OP61299761) osteopathic physician and surgeon credential. Patel’s principal license was granted in Texas, and in October 2024 the Texas Medical Board suspended his license to practice as an osteopathic physician.</p>
