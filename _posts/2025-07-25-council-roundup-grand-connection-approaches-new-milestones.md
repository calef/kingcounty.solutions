  Nods for proposed 2026 Bellevue-Redmond Tourism Area budget

  The council also voted in favor of staff returning with legislation to adopt the 2026 Bellevue-Redmond Tourism Promotional Area Annual Budget and Strategic Plan, as part of the 2026 mid-biennium technical budget process. The proposed budget, which was recently recommended by the Tourism Promotional Area Advisory Board, governs the use of revenues derived from lodging charges, which are collected from businesses that provide 40 or more units of taxable lodging to fund tourism promotion.

  This is the third budget and work plan prepared and recommended by the Tourism Promotional Area Advisory Board. Most recently, the 2025 Budget and Strategic Plan was adopted as part of the city’s 2025-2026 Operating Budget in November 2024.

The Bellevue City Council provided updates on several initiatives during its recent meeting. Key developments include the Grand Connection program, aimed at enhancing the pedestrian experience in downtown Bellevue. The city has established the Office of the Grand Connection for better coordination and will seek state approval for the Grand Connection Crossing over Interstate 405, employing a construction management method to keep the project within scope and budget.

Additionally, the council is working on an amendment to Bellevue City Code regarding e-scooters, which aims to create a shared micromobility program. Proposed changes will align local regulations with state law, including speed limits and age restrictions for riders.

Progress on the Sustainable Bellevue Plan was reported, highlighting that the city has exceeded its 50% emissions reduction target, achieving a 54% reduction from 2011 levels. A public comment period for the draft 2026-2030 plan will open in August, with final adoption expected in November.

Lastly, the council voted to advance legislation for the 2026 Bellevue-Redmond Tourism Promotional Area budget, which will guide tourism funding derived from lodging charges. The next council meeting is scheduled for Aug. 4.
