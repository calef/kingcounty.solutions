The Bellevue City Council provided updates on several initiatives during its recent meeting. Key developments include the Grand Connection program, aimed at enhancing the pedestrian experience in downtown Bellevue. The city has established the Office of the Grand Connection for better coordination and will seek state approval for the Grand Connection Crossing over Interstate 405, employing a construction management method to keep the project within scope and budget.

Additionally, the council is working on an amendment to Bellevue City Code regarding e-scooters, which aims to create a shared micromobility program. Proposed changes will align local regulations with state law, including speed limits and age restrictions for riders.

Progress on the Sustainable Bellevue Plan was reported, highlighting that the city has exceeded its 50% emissions reduction target, achieving a 54% reduction from 2011 levels. A public comment period for the draft 2026-2030 plan will open in August, with final adoption expected in November.

Lastly, the council voted to advance legislation for the 2026 Bellevue-Redmond Tourism Promotional Area Budget, which will guide tourism funding derived from lodging charges. The next council meeting is scheduled for August 4.
