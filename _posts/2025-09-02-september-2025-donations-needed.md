Hospitality House welcomes donations that directly benefit its residents. When entering, visitors see bins filled with items donated by the community. These items, sourced from an Amazon Donations Needed list, are sent to Hospitality House, processed, and organized for residents to access. This setup allows residents to choose what they need, promoting their autonomy and dignity. The organization emphasizes that no one should struggle to obtain basic necessities like shampoo or deodorant while they are seeking employment or housing. The community's generosity plays a crucial role in supporting residents, and their contributions are greatly appreciated. Thank you for your support.
