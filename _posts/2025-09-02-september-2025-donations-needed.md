  <p>When you enter Hospitality House, one of the first thing you&#8217;ll see are bins of items generously donated by YOU! Items purchased from our Amazon Donations Needed list are sent directly to Hospitality House, processed, and stored where they are available for residents to &#8220;shop,&#8221; giving them the autonomy and dignity they so deserve.</p>



  <p>Residents are encouraged to take what they need. No one should have to worry about access to shampoo or deodorant while they search for a job or a place to live. Your generosity is visible &amp; so appreciated each &amp; every day!
