  Today, Wellspring’s Early Learning Center (ELC) remains the only program in Washington State specializing in serving children ages one through five who are experiencing the traumatic effects of homelessness.

  Over the past decade, the ELC has served 344 children and 253 families, offering far more than just a safe place to learn. It’s a place where children build resilience, experience stability, and develop the critical skills they need to thrive.

In March 1988, Wellspring Family Services launched a unique program, the Morningsong Homeless Families Support Center, which has evolved into the Wellspring Early Learning Center (ELC). Now, 37 years later, the ELC remains the only program in Washington state dedicated to children ages 1 to 5 affected by homelessness. Over the past decade, it has served 344 children and 253 families, emphasizing resilience, stability, and essential developmental skills. Children exiting the ELC typically gain 53 skills across various domains, including social-emotional growth and school readiness.

The ELC utilizes a trauma-informed approach with a low teacher-to-child ratio, ensuring personalized learning. Its no-expulsion policy and comprehensive family support services, including mental health resources and nutritious meals, foster a nurturing environment. Research supports the efficacy of trauma-informed care, showing improvements in emotional regulation, language skills, and parent-child relationships. Each year, the ELC serves up to 45 children, strengthening families' stability and access to resources necessary for long-term success. As it celebrates 37 years, Wellspring expresses gratitude to its community of supporters, reaffirming its commitment to providing safe, supportive environments for vulnerable children and families.
