Mark Epstein, a retired history teacher from Rainier Beach High School, reflects on his legacy of cycling as he shares the story of his enduring Trek 920 bike, which he purchased in 1998 from Bike Works, South Seattle's only bike shop. Mark rides his bike to school daily, emphasizing its significance in his life and his efforts to engage students in understanding the world. His bike, which he affectionately refers to as his "purple forever bike," has been meticulously maintained by Bike Works, which has replaced various components over the years. This commitment to repair and reuse aligns with Bike Works' mission of diverting around 6,000 bicycles from waste each year, promoting a sustainable cycling culture.

Mark's influence extends beyond biking; he has inspired students like a former pupil who became a labor leader, showcasing the profound impact of teaching. He believes that learning to ride a bike empowers individuals with choices and fosters community connection. Mark notes that many of his former students are now educators and parents themselves, illustrating the cyclical nature of teaching and learning. His journey highlights how cycling can shape perceptions and foster resilience, community, and lifelong learning.
