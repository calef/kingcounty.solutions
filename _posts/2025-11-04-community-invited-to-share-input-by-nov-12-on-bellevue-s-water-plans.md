  Bellevue Utilities is updating three essential plans that guide how the city manages its storm and surface water, drinking water, and wastewater systems. These plans help ensure Bellevue continues to provide reliable services, protect the environment and support a healthy, thriving community.

  Residents are invited to share feedback by Nov. 12 through a short online survey and to apply for a focus group to discuss community values and water priorities in more detail.

Bellevue Utilities is updating three key plans that manage the city's storm and surface water, drinking water, and wastewater systems. These updates aim to ensure reliable services, environmental protection, and community well-being. Utilities Director Lucy Liu emphasized the importance of resident input, stating, “No one likes flooded streets, polluted waterways, or declining plant and animal habitats.” 

To gather community feedback, residents are invited to participate in a short online survey and apply for a focus group by Nov. 12. This initiative seeks to align city water management strategies with the priorities and values of Bellevue residents. More information is available on the project website, where residents can access the survey and focus group application.
