Veterans can access care through community providers when the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) cannot provide timely services. The Community Care program is designed to help veterans obtain necessary medical care closer to home. Veterans are eligible for this program if they meet specific criteria, such as living far from a VA facility, experiencing long wait times, or requiring services not available within the VA system.

To navigate this program, veterans should first consult with their VA primary care provider, who can determine eligibility for community care. If eligible, they will receive a referral and authorization to seek care from a community provider. Veterans can also access the VA's online tools to find local providers and manage their appointments.

The VA emphasizes the importance of communication between veterans and their community providers to ensure continuity of care. Additionally, veterans should keep track of their appointments and any necessary paperwork to streamline the process. Resources are available through the VA to assist veterans in understanding their benefits and navigating the community care system effectively.
