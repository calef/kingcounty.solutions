Public and active transportation users are invited to participate in the second season of community conversations about the North Spokane Corridor’s final connection project. This series will concentrate on planning improvements around the Interstate 90 corridor. The first meeting is scheduled for Thursday, November 20, with sessions continuing monthly through April 2026. Meetings will start with a brief presentation followed by a workshop for participants to engage with concepts aimed at enhancing community connections, offering comments, and sharing feedback.

The initial workshop will recap previous community input and focus on identifying meaningful places and potential new placemaking features. Doors open at 4:30 p.m. at Frances Scott Elementary, with the program starting at 5 p.m. Attendees can also join virtually via Microsoft Teams. A complimentary pizza dinner will be provided, along with an unsupervised children's activity area. Free Wi-Fi will be available at multiple locations for virtual participation.
