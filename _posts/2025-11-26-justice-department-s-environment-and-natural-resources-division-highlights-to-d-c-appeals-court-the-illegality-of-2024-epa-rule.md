The Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division (ENRD) has urged the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to invalidate the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) 2024 air quality standard for particulate matter. The ENRD argues that the EPA took an unlawful regulatory shortcut when imposing the standard, violating the Clean Air Act, which mandates a comprehensive review of scientific data before changing air quality standards. The ENRD's filing indicates that the EPA, under the previous administration, adopted a costly national air quality standard without proper scientific evaluation or consideration of the rule's economic impacts. It emphasizes that the EPA has recommitted to lawful practices under the current administration. The ENRD contends that repealing the 2024 rule would ensure compliance with the Clean Air Act and protect Americans from potentially harmful environmental regulations.
