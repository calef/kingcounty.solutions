  Council to consider camera sites and code changes this winter

  The City of Bellevue has identified 37 potential locations for new speed safety cameras as part of its ongoing efforts to reduce crashes and improve safety on city streets. The proposed sites will be presented to the City Council this winter, along with recommended city code changes to support expanded camera enforcement.

The City of Bellevue has identified 37 potential locations for new speed safety cameras to enhance road safety and reduce crashes. These proposed sites will be presented to the City Council this winter, alongside recommended changes to city code to support the expanded use of cameras. Community feedback will be solicited through surveys available until November 30. Key concerns raised by residents include the seriousness of speeding, the need for accuracy and privacy in camera enforcement, and the importance of targeting areas with high crash rates, such as school zones and street-racing hotspots. The city is finalizing an operations guide emphasizing safety, equity, and fairness, with plans for lower fines for certain individuals and widespread camera distribution. This initiative is part of Bellevue's Vision Zero strategy, aiming to eliminate traffic deaths and serious injuries by 2030. Following City Council approval in December, phased installation of cameras may begin in mid-2026, including a public awareness campaign and a 30-day warning period before citations are issued.
