Tickets are now available for the final Uncork the Night event, set for October 4 at the W Bellevue. The event will be led by Lindsay Rucker from Greet West Bellevue Magazine and Sophia Siu, a Bellevue LifeSpring Board Member. This gala marks the conclusion of a 20-year tradition that has raised funds for essential programs supporting local children facing hunger and homelessness. Both chairs are deeply invested in the cause, with Sophia emphasizing the growing needs in Bellevue and Lindsay sharing her personal journey as a single mother who benefited from community support.

Guests can expect a lively evening featuring curated wine tastings, a silent auction, a live auction, and engaging stories of impact. The event is designed to foster community spirit and connection, with interactive experiences like the dessert dash. Both Lindsay and Sophia hope to celebrate the legacy of Uncork the Night while looking forward to new opportunities for community involvement. They invite attendees to engage in conversations about Bellevue LifeSpring and encourage continued support for local families. Sophia encapsulates the event in three words: "Community, friendship, and philanthropy."
