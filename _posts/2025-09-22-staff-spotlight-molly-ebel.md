Molly Ebel serves as a creative engagement specialist at Aging Wisdom, where her role has evolved over three years as she works with diverse clients and families. Inspired by her family's caregiving journey for her parents, she pursued a University of Washington certificate in gerontology, fueling her passion for the aging field. Ebel is excited about expanding creative engagement to adult family homes in group settings. She cherishes her interactions with clients and colleagues, finding joy in being present and learning from each experience. 

A notable success story involves helping a client with Alzheimer’s transition to assisted living. By introducing a pocket talker to assist with her hearing difficulties, Ebel has seen her client's engagement and joy increase significantly, as she can now better interact with others and express herself through singing and laughter. Ebel's motivation stems from her desire to bring light to her clients' days and support them through challenging times, all while being part of a dedicated team committed to meaningful work in the aging community.
