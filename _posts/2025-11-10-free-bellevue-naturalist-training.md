Applications are open for the free Bellevue Naturalist training program, aimed at cultivating a group of dedicated community volunteers focused on environmental stewardship and awareness. Participants will lead hikes, canoe trips, and forest restoration events while maintaining restoration sites. Ideal candidates should have a passion for the outdoors and a willingness to learn. Bellevue residents will be prioritized, but applications from other cities will be accepted if space permits. Training sessions are scheduled from February 5 to April 23, 2026, on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 6-8 p.m., along with Saturday field trips. Following the training, volunteers are required to commit to 100 hours of service with the Parks & Community Services Department's Natural Resources division. Interested individuals must complete and submit an online application packet available at Bellevue Naturalist by the deadline of November 30.
