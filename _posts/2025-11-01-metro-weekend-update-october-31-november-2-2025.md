Metro services will be impacted this weekend due to construction. Routes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 13, 14, 21, 24, 27, 28, 33, 40, 56, 62, 124, 131, 132, and RapidRide C, D, and H Lines will be affected by the closure of 3rd Avenue & Virginia Street from October 31 at 7 p.m. to November 3 at 5 a.m. Additionally, Route 183 will be rerouted off S Star Lake Road and S 272nd Street on November 2 until 1 p.m. due to construction, and ST 554 will not serve the Rainier Avenue S & S Charles Street stop from October 31 at 10 p.m. to November 1 at 6 a.m. due to the I-90 floating bridge closure. 

Riders are encouraged to take transit to sporting events, including a Seattle Kraken game on Saturday at Climate Pledge Arena. The Water Taxi is operating on a winter schedule, and the Seattle Center Monorail will run from 7:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Saturday, and 8:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Sunday.
