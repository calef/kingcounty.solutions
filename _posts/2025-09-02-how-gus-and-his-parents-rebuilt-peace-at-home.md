Mia and Max faced challenges when they relocated their family from Brooklyn to Seattle, particularly affecting their 3-year-old son, Gus. The transition disrupted Gus's familiar routines, leading to behavioral issues, including physical meltdowns and defiance. In search of help, the family sought guidance from their pediatrician, who recommended the Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT) program offered by YES. This evidence-based therapy aims to strengthen the parent-child bond while improving children's behavior. During sessions, parents receive real-time coaching from a therapist while interacting with their child in a specially designed room.

A pivotal moment occurred when Gus, after learning a time-out process, calmly followed through with it for the first time. Currently, Gus is thriving—he articulates his feelings, accepts consequences, and seeks reconnection with his parents. Mia emphasizes the importance of access to such resources, stating that it extends beyond parenting to essential life skills. The success of Gus's story is supported by community donations, ensuring families in need receive necessary assistance without financial barriers.
