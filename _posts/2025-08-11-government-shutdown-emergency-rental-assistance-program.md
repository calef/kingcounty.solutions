Community Roots is expanding its Emergency Rental Assistance program temporarily during November and December 2025 to support residents affected by the federal government shutdown. This initiative aims to assist those facing financial setbacks or unforeseen circumstances, which may include disruptions in access to critical programs like SNAP, WIC, and LIHEAP, as well as increases in insurance premiums. Eligible residents can receive help covering up to two months of rent. The program is designed to ensure that 25 Community Roots households can remain housed during these challenging times. Donations are being sought to help achieve this goal.
