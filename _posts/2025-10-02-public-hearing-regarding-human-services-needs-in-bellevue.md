The Bellevue Human Services Commission will host a public hearing on housing and human services needs on Monday, October 20, at 6 p.m. at City Hall, located at 450 110th Ave. NE. This hearing aims to gather community input regarding the services required for low- and moderate-income residents, including access to food, shelter, financial assistance, behavioral health services, and support for marginalized groups such as youth, seniors, and individuals with disabilities. The feedback collected will guide funding recommendations for the City Council and aid in developing the 2026 Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) annual action plan. This plan outlines the proposed utilization of federal funds from the Department of Housing and Urban Development and will be open for public comment for 30 days after the hearing. The meeting will be accessible both online and in person. The agenda will be posted on the Human Services Commission calendar on October 16. Written comments can be submitted via email to the Human Services Commission by noon on October 20. Requests for alternate formats or accommodations must be made at least 48 hours in advance.
