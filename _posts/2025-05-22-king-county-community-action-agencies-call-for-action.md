King County's Community Action Agencies, including Byrd Barr Place, El Centro de la Raza, Hopelink, Multi-Service Center, Neighborhood House, and Solid Ground, are urging action to protect essential programs for vulnerable residents amid proposed federal budget cuts. As Congress negotiates the FY2026 budget, these agencies warn that without bipartisan support for human services, they may face severe funding reductions or shutdowns. Proposed cuts include a 10% reduction to Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), a 20% cut to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and significant cuts to housing support and Medicaid, which could impact over 265,000 individuals in King County.

The agencies emphasize that funding cuts will not only harm those in need but also strain the broader community and economy, particularly in high-cost areas like King County. Historical data show that during economic crises, nonprofits have been crucial in providing support and rebuilding local economies. The organizations are calling on community members to advocate for funding and offer support through donations and volunteering, highlighting the critical role local nonprofits play in community resilience.
