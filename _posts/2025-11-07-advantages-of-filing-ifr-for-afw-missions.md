  <p>Hello AFW Command Pilots, specifically IFR-rated Command Pilots. OK, so I feel bad for all the VFR-only Angel Flight Command Pilots, as this article doesn’t apply to you (unless it encourages you to get your instrument rating!).</p>



  <p>I don’t fly nearly as many Angel Flight missions as I’d like to, but most of those flights were VFR flights. However, I have recently filed and flown several IFR Angel Flights, regardless of the weather. I’ve found that filing and flying IFR for Angel Flights provides many advantages over VFR flights. Please note also that Item #12 of the AFW Affirmation requires you to be instrument rated and current for night flights.</p>



  <p><strong>Weather flexibility</strong></p>



  <p>If you routinely file IFR for Angel Flight missions, your anxiety over the weather is greatly reduced. Of course, you still need to consider turbulence and icing, but clouds and precipitation along your route are less of a concern. Also, when weather is worse than forecast, ATC can help with a reroute or even a destination change. If you don’t have weather information in the cockpit (but who doesn’t these days??), ATC can provide downstream or destination METARs upon request. Also, if there is a chance that your flight could extend into the night hours, you must be instrument rated and current. It also helps to be operating on an IFR flight plan at night, especially in rural areas with few lights.</p>



  <p><strong>Airspace</strong></p>



  <p>Although I regularly fly in the Bay Area, with its complex Class B, C and D airspace, I get a little nervous flying into other metropolitan areas.&nbsp; Although ATC will usually grant VFR flights clearance into these areas if asked, sometimes they’re very busy and will tell you to remain clear of B or C airspace. IFR flights are automatically allowed without specific requests needed. Also, your route clearances will keep you out of any Restricted airspace and active MOAs.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Your cleared altitude or ATC instructions will keep you clear of terrain, but as always, trust but verify.</p>



  <p><strong>ATC Hand Holding</strong></p>



  <p>With very rare exceptions, and when departing from or arriving at uncontrolled airports, you are in contact with ATC for the entire IFR flight. They’re available anytime you need them, and even if you have an emergency like an engine failure or control system issue when communicating is your third priority (right?), ATC will notice and get to you quickly. And as I mentioned previously, they can also provide weather updates, reroutes, or destination changes. Also, if you regularly file and operate IFR, you will feel more comfortable working in the IFR ATC environment when you are actually flying in IMC.</p>



  <p><strong>Why you might want to go VFR</strong></p>



  <p>I will still file VFR, or at least utilize Flight Following, for shorter flights in the daytime when weather is not a concern.&nbsp; In rare cases, weather conditions are such that VFR makes more sense, such as VFR ceilings below Minimum Enroute Altitudes that are above the freezing level. Sometimes the IFR routing isn’t as direct as you would like, especially in busy airspace. I’ve also had to wait a long time for an IFR release from airports near Class B or C (e.g., KHWD near KOAK or KRHV near KSJC). Of course, if I’m not feeling very IFR current (even if legally current), I’ll only sign up for fair weather flights and use Flight Following.</p>



  <p>I really enjoy flying Angel Flight missions when the weather is solid VFR, but I think I will continue to file and operate IFR for these flights when it makes sense.</p>



  <p>Thanks and fly safely!</p>



  <p>In safety,&nbsp;</p>

title: Advantages of Filing IFR for AFW Missions
topics: []

Filing IFR for Angel Flight West (AFW) missions offers several advantages for IFR-rated pilots. It significantly reduces anxiety over weather conditions, as clouds and precipitation along the route become less of a concern. Air Traffic Control (ATC) can assist with reroutes or destination changes if conditions worsen. Being IFR-rated is essential for night flights, allowing for safer navigation in rural areas with limited lighting.

Flying IFR also simplifies airspace navigation; ATC automatically grants clearance into complex metropolitan airspaces without specific requests. Additionally, IFR routes help avoid restricted airspace and ensure safe altitudes away from terrain. Continuous communication with ATC during IFR flights provides vital support, especially in emergencies, and enhances familiarity with IFR operations.

While there are scenarios where VFR may be preferable, such as short daytime flights in good weather, IFR is often the safer choice. Ultimately, many pilots find value in operating under IFR for AFW missions, balancing convenience and safety effectively.
