  <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>City Council Meeting Roundup</strong></h2>
  <p>On Tuesday, October 14th, the Normandy Park City Council held its regular monthly
  meeting. Below is a summary of key actions and discussions.</p> <p><strong>Approval
  of the King County Cooperative Watershed Management Grant</strong> – The City has
  been awarded a $225,000 grant through King County Cooperative Watershed Management
  for property acquisition<strong>. </strong>Funds will be used to purchase property
  that will expand Marine View Park.</p> <p><strong>Renewal of the Website Maintenance
  &amp; Creative Services Contract</strong> – The City Council renewed the website
  management contract with 575, Inc. The costs of services remain unchanged from the
  current contract.</p> <p><strong>Approval of the Department of Ecology Water Quality
  Capacity Grant</strong> – The City Council accepted a $130,000 award from the Department
  of Ecology to conduct work related to implementing municipal stormwater National
  Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit requirements.</p> <p><strong>First
  Reading of Ordinances #1081 &amp; #1082 – </strong>The City Council approved moving
  two ordinances, related to updating the City’s Road Standards, to the November City
  Council meeting for final reading. If approved, the new Road Design and Construction
  Standards will set forth specific, consistent, and acceptable road design and construction
  elements for developers, private parties, and the City. Before the standards are
  adopted, specific code conflicts need to be addressed. The first ordinance either
  repeals, replaces, or revises several provisions of Titles 10, 17, and 18 that are
  more effectively addressed within the new standards or that are no longer considered
  best management practices. The second ordinance will officially adopt the 2025 Normandy
  Park Road Design and Construction Standards. The City Council will consider final
  approval at its meeting on November 12th.</p> <p><strong>Contract to complete a
  Stormwater Utility Rate Study was approved </strong>– This project includes a surface
  water utility cost-of-service (or Storm Water) rate study and proposed rate revisions. 
  The goal is to have this rate study completed in time to present it at the required
  public hearing meetings and obtain City Council approval by April 2026. If the study
  results are approved, the rates will be incorporated into the 2027-2028 budget,
  and approved rate revisions will be submitted to King County in time for implementation
  of the 2027 rates.</p> <p><strong>Reappointment of Paul de Barros to the Art Commission

  <p>What’s Next for City Hall? We often receive the question, “What’s going on with

  future of Normandy Park City Hall has been a topic of discussion for several years.
  Our current building was originally constructed in the 1950s as an elementary school
  and later converted into City Hall in the late 1980s. While it has served the community
  well, it was never intended to function as a modern municipal facility. As a result,
  the City has been exploring options to ensure that we have a safe, efficient, and
  functional building that can continue to serve residents daily.</p> </div> <a href="https://normandyparkwa.gov/city-news/city-manager/city-manager-report-october-31-2025/"
