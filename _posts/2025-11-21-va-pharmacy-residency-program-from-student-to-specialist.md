A pharmacy residency program at the VA has welcomed its first student specialist, Johnnie Chapman, who is pursuing a postgraduate year two (PGY2) residency in psychiatric pharmacy. Chapman's role involves collaborating with clinical pharmacy specialists and providing patient care in mental health, which includes medication management and education for veterans. 

The residency program aims to enhance the quality of care for veterans by integrating more specialized pharmacy services. It also emphasizes the importance of psychiatric pharmacy in managing complex medication regimens for veterans with mental health conditions. With this initiative, the VA hopes to improve outcomes and support the mental health needs of its patients through advanced pharmacy practice. 

Chapman's participation marks a significant step in expanding pharmacy roles within the VA healthcare system, showcasing the commitment to providing comprehensive care for veterans. As the program progresses, it is expected to attract more pharmacy professionals interested in specializing in mental health, ultimately benefiting the veteran community.
