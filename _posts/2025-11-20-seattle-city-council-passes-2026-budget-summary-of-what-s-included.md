The Seattle City Council's budget committee has unanimously approved the 2026 budget, emphasizing significant investments in safety and affordability for working families. Key areas of focus include affordability, homelessness, public safety, and community building. The budget allocates a record $349.5 million for affordable housing, alongside $10 million for rental assistance and increased tenant services. It also sets aside $9 million for shelters and $4 million for a new Community Solutions Initiative to combat homelessness.

Additionally, food access initiatives receive $6.2 million for the Fresh Bucks program and increased support for food banks. The budget includes $3 million for senior centers and $6.9 million to double Community Crisis Responder teams, enhancing public safety services. The police department's hiring plan is fully funded, aiming to recruit over 170 new officers. 

Transportation safety improvements are also prioritized, with substantial funding for pedestrian safety and shared streets initiatives. Fiscal responsibility measures include a $4.7 million increase to the Rainy Day Fund and $14 million to mitigate potential federal funding cuts. This comprehensive budget reflects the Council's commitment to enhancing community well-being and addressing urgent needs in Seattle.
