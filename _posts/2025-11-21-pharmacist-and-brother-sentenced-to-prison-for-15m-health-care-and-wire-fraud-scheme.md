A former Michigan pharmacist, Raad Kouza, and his brother, Ramis Kouza, a pharmacy manager, were sentenced for their involvement in a health care and wire fraud scheme that resulted in over $15 million in losses to Medicare, Medicaid, and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan. Raad received an eight-year prison sentence, while Ramis was sentenced to five years. The brothers billed for prescription medications they never dispensed at their pharmacies from 2010 to 2019, focusing on high-cost drugs such as antipsychotics and inhalers. They concealed inventory shortages from auditors to facilitate this fraud. In November 2024, a federal jury in the Eastern District of Michigan found them guilty of conspiracy to commit health care fraud and wire fraud. They were ordered to pay approximately $15.5 million in restitution and forfeiture. The case was investigated by the FBI and the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, with prosecution led by attorneys from the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section. The Health Care Fraud Strike Force Program has charged over 5,800 defendants since its inception, collectively billing over $30 billion to federal health care programs and private insurers.
