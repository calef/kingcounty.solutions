This spring marks the one-year anniversary of the Tri-Cities Outpatient Mental Health (OPMH) program, launched in April 2024 to address growing mental health needs in Benton and Franklin Counties. The program aims to reduce the wait time for mental health services and supports youth up to age 21 with therapy, case management, medication management, and resource navigation. LCSNW, a key provider of youth programs in the Tri-Cities for over 60 years, has introduced OPMH as a less intensive option for clients of existing programs like Wraparound with Intensive Services (WISe) and Stabilization and Wellness in Families Together (SWIFT), as well as new individuals. Currently, services are available only to those with Medicaid, but plans are in place to expand payment options to include private insurance and self-pay. Although the program is currently staffed by two Mental Health Clinicians, there are aspirations for growth in staffing and resources. OPMH is dedicated to fostering an environment where youth can thrive and is committed to meeting the mental health needs of the community with timely and effective support.
