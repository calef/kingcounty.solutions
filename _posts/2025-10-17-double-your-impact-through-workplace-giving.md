---

Many employers offer matching gift programs or workplace giving options that can double your donations to BrightSpark, benefiting children, families, and early learning providers in King and Pierce Counties. By donating through your company's giving platform or requesting a match after your contribution, you significantly enhance your support. Workplace giving not only simplifies the donation process but also provides a sustainable funding source for BrightSpark's efforts in improving access, quality, and advocacy in early learning. To participate, check with your HR department to see if your employer provides matching gifts or payroll giving options, and designate BrightSpark Early Learning Services (EIN: 94-1465046) as your nonprofit of choice. BrightSpark accepts various donation methods, including cash, credit cards, fund transfers, checks, money orders, stocks, bonds, and donor-advised funds. For more information about giving options, you can contact their fund development department. Together, we can reinforce child-centered, antiracist early learning initiatives in our community.
