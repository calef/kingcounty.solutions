Celebration of Youth has concluded, raising an impressive $574,603. Gratitude is extended to all participants and supporters of the event. Special thanks are given to the panelists, including Porscha Anderson, Simon Foster, and Marisa Mondave, as well as the emcees Brad Blackburn, Tiana Cole, Lauren Kula, and Faraji Blakeney.
