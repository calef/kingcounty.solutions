Salatah Fallahia, or Palestinian Farmer's Salad, is a refreshing dish that serves six. The salad includes finely chopped ingredients such as six Persian cucumbers (or one English cucumber), one medium onion, four scallions, four medium tomatoes, one jalapeno pepper, a bunch of parsley, and a quarter cup of fresh mint leaves. 

The dressing consists of one-third cup of fresh lemon juice, one-third cup of extra virgin olive oil, one small crushed garlic clove, one tablespoon of white vinegar, one tablespoon of sumac, and one teaspoon of fine sea salt, adjustable to taste. 

To prepare the salad, combine all the chopped vegetables in a medium bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, vinegar, sumac, and salt to create the dressing. Finally, add the dressing to the vegetables just before serving for a vibrant and flavorful dish.
