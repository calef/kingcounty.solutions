MultiCare Health System has announced a partnership with Tellica Imaging to enhance access to affordable medical imaging services in the Puget Sound area. Three new facilities will open on October 7 in Auburn, Bremerton, and Tacoma, operating Monday through Saturday from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. These centers will offer services such as CT and MRI scans, with plans to accept most insurance by early 2026 and provide flat-rate pricing for all imaging services. Each diagnostic appointment will include interpretation by fellowship-trained radiologists, lab work, and necessary intravenous contrast. Tim Lynch, MultiCare's chief administrative officer, emphasized the initiative's goal to create affordable solutions amidst rising healthcare costs. Tellica Imaging, a not-for-profit company affiliated with Intermountain Health, currently operates facilities in Utah, Idaho, and New Hampshire, marking its debut in Washington state with these new locations. Brad Isaacson, Tellica's president, noted that the centers aim to improve patient access while alleviating appointment backlogs at local hospitals. MultiCare is a comprehensive health system in Washington, comprising 13 hospitals and over 28,000 employees dedicated to delivering quality healthcare services.
