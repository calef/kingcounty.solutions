On January 26, construction began at Broadway and Pine in Capitol Hill for the Constellation Center, a collaborative project by Community Roots Housing, YouthCare, and the Seattle Chinatown International District Preservation and Development Authority. This initiative aims to address the urgent needs of over 1,800 young people experiencing homelessness in King County by combining affordable housing with a youth development center. YouthCare will lead the development of a 24,000-square-foot facility that provides workforce training, education, and wraparound services for vulnerable youth. Adjacent to the center, Community Roots will construct 84 affordable homes, with 15 units specifically reserved for youth transitioning out of homelessness. The project, described as a civic endeavor, seeks to empower the community and create effective interventions for low-income and unhoused individuals. The new apartments will include studio and one-bedroom units, catering to households earning 30% to 50% of the area median income, which translates to annual incomes between $31,620 and $52,700. The Constellation Center will function as a hub for career development, helping young people build stable futures. The project is expected to be completed by spring 2027, with a celebration planned for March 25.
