  <p>The <a href="https://kcrha.org/community-data/king-county-point-in-time-count/">2024 Unsheltered Point-in-Time Count</a> identified over 1,800 young people experiencing homelessness in King County. Creative, comprehensive strategies are urgently needed.</p>
  <p>On January 26, construction crews broke ground at the corner of Broadway and Pine in Capitol Hill.

  <p><a href="https://youthcare.org/">YouthCare</a> is leading the development of the <a href="https://youthcare.org/constellation-center/">Constellation Center</a>, a 24,000-square-foot facility offering workforce training, education, and wraparound services tailored for youth in need. Next to the center, Community Roots is constructing 84 new affordable homes, reserving 15 for youth transitioning out of homelessness.</p>
  <p>“At its core, this project is a civic endeavor that meets urgent, city-wide needs to support our low-income and unhoused neighbors.

  <p>Community Roots Housing will operate the new apartments, which will include a mix of studio and one-bedroom units.

That is the equivalent of an individual annual income between $31,620 and $52,700. YouthCare’s Constellation Center sits at the heart of this initiative, offering young people the tools to succeed. The center will provide sector-specific job training and holistic youth services, helping participants build stable futures.</p>
  <p>&#8220;The Constellation Center represents a bold step toward transforming the lives of young people in our community,” said Degale Cooper, CEO of YouthCare. “By creating a dedicated hub for workforce development, we are bridging the gap between potential and opportunity. Young people will gain the tools, training, and support needed to build lasting careers and stable futures. This is more than a center—it’s a launching pad for the dreams of the next generation.&#8221;</p>
  <p>While the new construction will replace the original building, the original style of the façade will be rebuilt. This expansion will allow YouthCare to broaden its programs, creating a hub of career-building opportunities and resources for young people. On March 25, we will be celebrating the groundbreaking of the project alongside our community partners. Looking forward, the project is expected to be completed in the spring of 2027.</p>

On Jan. 26, construction began at Broadway and Pine in Capitol Hill for the Constellation Center, a collaborative project by Community Roots Housing, YouthCare, and the Seattle Chinatown International District Preservation and Development Authority. This initiative aims to address the urgent needs of more than 1,800 young people experiencing homelessness in King County by combining affordable housing with a youth development center. YouthCare will lead the development of a 24,000-square-foot facility that provides workforce training, education, and wraparound services for vulnerable youth. 

Adjacent to the center, Community Roots will construct 84 affordable homes, with 15 units specifically reserved for youth transitioning out of homelessness. The project, described as a civic endeavor, seeks to empower the community and create effective interventions for low-income and unhoused individuals. The new apartments will include studio and one-bedroom units, catering to households earning 30% to 50% of the area median income, which translates to annual incomes between $31,620 and $52,700. 

The Constellation Center will function as a hub for career development, helping young people build stable futures. The project is expected to be completed by spring 2027, with a celebration planned for March 25.
