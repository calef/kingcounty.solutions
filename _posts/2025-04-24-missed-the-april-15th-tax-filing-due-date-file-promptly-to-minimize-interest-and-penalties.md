  <p>IR-2025-51, April 16, 2025</p>



  <p>WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service encourages taxpayers who missed the filing deadline to submit their tax return as soon as possible. Those who missed the deadline to file but owe taxes should file timely to avoid additional penalties and interest.</p>



  <p>Taxpayers should keep in mind that requesting an extension allows for additional time to file but not to pay taxes owed. Individuals who owe taxes should file their tax return and pay as soon as they can.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irs.gov/payments/interest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Interest and penalties</a>&nbsp;will continue to accrue on the owed taxes until the balance is paid in full.</p>



  <div style="height:32px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



  <p><strong>File and pay to limit penalties and interest</strong></p>



  <p>Even if a taxpayer cannot afford to immediately pay the full amount of taxes owed, they should still file a tax return and pay as much as possible. The IRS offers&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/options-for-taxpayers-who-need-help-paying-their-tax-bill" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">options for taxpayers who need help paying their tax bill</a>. For more information,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irs.gov/payments/penalties" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">visit the Penalties</a>&nbsp;page on IRS.gov.</p>



  <p>Taxpayers may qualify for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irs.gov/payments/penalty-relief" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">penalty relief</a>&nbsp;if they have filed and paid timely for the past three years and meet other important requirements. For more information, see the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irs.gov/payments/administrative-penalty-relief" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Administrative penalty relief</a>&nbsp;page on IRS.gov.</p>



  <div style="height:32px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



  <p><strong>Online payment options</strong></p>



  <p>Individuals can pay taxes owed securely through&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irs.gov/payments/online-account-for-individuals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IRS Online Account</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irs.gov/payments/direct-pay-with-bank-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IRS Direct Pay</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irs.gov/payments/eftps-the-electronic-federal-tax-payment-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS)</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irs.gov/payments/pay-your-taxes-by-debit-or-credit-card" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">debit or credit card or digital wallet</a>.

  <div style="height:32px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



  <p><strong>Due for a refund? Don’t overlook filing a tax return</strong></p>



  <p>There&#8217;s no penalty for filing after the April 15 deadline if a refund is due. Every year, the IRS estimates nearly a million taxpayers who failed to file prior year tax returns are potentially due refund money.</p>



  <p>Taxpayers who choose not to file a return because they don&#8217;t earn enough to meet the filing requirement may miss out on receiving a refund due to potential refundable tax credits. Examples include the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/earned-income-tax-credit-eitc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Earned Income Tax Credit</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irs.gov/help/ita/does-my-childdependent-qualify-for-the-child-tax-credit-or-the-credit-for-other-dependents" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Child Tax Credit</a>. Taxpayers sometimes fail to file a tax return and claim a refund for these credits and others for which they may be eligible.</p>



  <p>Taxpayers can track their refund using the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irs.gov/wheres-my-refund" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Where&#8217;s My Refund?</a>&nbsp;tool on IRS.gov, on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irs.gov/help/irs2goapp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IRS2Go</a>&nbsp;mobile app or by calling the automated refund hotline at&nbsp;<a href="tel:8008291954">800-829-1954</a>. To use the Where&#8217;s My Refund? tool, taxpayers need the primary Social Security number on the tax return, the filing status and the expected refund amount. The refund status information updates once daily.</p>



  <p>Taxpayers who still need to file for the 2024 tax year are encouraged to take advantage of electronic filing options such as IRS&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.irs.gov/app/freeFile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Free File</a>, which is available on IRS.gov through Oct. 20, or IRS&nbsp;<a href="https://directfile.irs.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Direct File</a>, available to qualified taxpayers in 25 states.</p>



  <div style="height:32px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



  <p><strong>Choose a trusted tax professional</strong></p>



  <p>Taxpayers who have yet to file a return might consider seeking assistance from a tax preparer. The IRS provides resources if they&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irs.gov/tax-professionals/choosing-a-tax-professional" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">need someone to prepare a tax return</a>.

  <div style="height:32px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



  <p><strong>Taxpayer Bill of Rights</strong></p>



  <p>Taxpayers have fundamental rights under the law that protect them when interacting with the IRS. The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irs.gov/taxpayer-bill-of-rights" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Taxpayer Bill of Rights</a>&nbsp;divides them into 10 categories. IRS&nbsp;<a href="https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-publication-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Publication 1, Your Rights as a Taxpayer</a>, reiterates these rights along with the agency&#8217;s obligation to protect them.</p>

Taxpayers who missed the April 15 tax-filing deadline are urged by the IRS to file their tax return as soon as possible to limit penalties and interest. While an extension allows for more time to file, it does not extend the time to pay owed taxes. Filing promptly is crucial, even if full payment cannot be made immediately. The IRS has options available for those needing assistance with their tax bill, and taxpayers may qualify for penalty relief if they have a history of timely filing and payment.

For those owed a refund, there is no penalty for late filing, and many taxpayers may be missing out on potential refunds due to refundable tax credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit. Taxpayers can track their refunds using the IRS tools available online. Electronic filing options, including IRS Free File, remain available for those needing to file for the 2024 tax year. Assistance from tax professionals is also recommended, and resources are available for finding qualified preparers. PIM Savvy offers free year-round tax preparation services for eligible individuals through its Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program.
