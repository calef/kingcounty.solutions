  and Penalties

Taxpayers who missed the April 15 tax-filing deadline are urged by the IRS to file their tax return as soon as possible to limit penalties and interest. While an extension allows for more time to file, it does not extend the time to pay owed taxes. Filing promptly is crucial, even if full payment cannot be made immediately. The IRS has options available for those needing assistance with their tax bill, and taxpayers may qualify for penalty relief if they have a history of timely filing and payment.

For those owed a refund, there is no penalty for late filing, and many taxpayers may be missing out on potential refunds due to refundable tax credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit. Taxpayers can track their refunds using the IRS tools available online. Electronic filing options, including IRS Free File, remain available for those needing to file for the 2024 tax year. Assistance from tax professionals is also recommended, and resources are available for finding qualified preparers. PIM Savvy offers free year-round tax preparation services for eligible individuals through its Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program.
