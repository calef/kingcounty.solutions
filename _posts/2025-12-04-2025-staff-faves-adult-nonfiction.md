  <p><a href="https://seattle.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S30C4013517"><strong>One Day, Everyone Will Have Always Been Against This </strong></a>by Omar el-Akkad<br />
  With a focus on the war in Gaza since 2023, el-Akkad takes aim at the dehumanization and apathy from both everyday people and mainstream media that seems integral to the functioning of power in our country, despite the frequent evocation of Western ideals. Kirkus Reviews called it “a philosophically rich critique of state violence and mass apathy.”</p>
  <p><a href="https://seattle.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S30C4040772"><strong>The Dry Season: A Memoir of Pleasure in a Year Without Sex</strong></a> by Melissa Febos<br />
  Over a year spent celibate and single, after decades of dating and a particularly significant breakup, Febos dedicated herself to really knowing herself. In addition to her personal journey, Febos digs into the history of religious and cultural abstinence. Staff Victoria raved: “supremely luscious writing for being titled the &#8220;dry&#8221; season…I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ve gone through life thus far without having read Melissa Febos&#8217; work before.”</p>
  <p><a href="https://seattle.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S30C4061774"><strong>Are You Mad at Me? How to Stop Focusing on What Others Think and Start Living for</strong> <strong>You</strong></a> by Meg Josephson<br />
  Psychotherapist Josephson examines the people pleasing impulse, connecting it to other common threat responses such as fight, flight, or freeze, and examining both how this manifests and the personal consequences. Josephson continues with how to reduce this behavior, including understanding one’s own emotions, setting boundaries, and sitting with discomfort. Publishers Weekly wrote that “recovering people pleasers will find plenty to chew on.”</p>
  <p><a href="https://seattle.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S30C4009921"><strong>Mood Machine: The Rise of Spotify and the Costs of the Perfect Playlist</strong></a> by Liz Pelly<br />
  Indie music scene journalist Pelly examines the history and impact of music-streaming service Spotify, from the early days of online pirated music to the dominance of Spotify and the way it impacts all elements of the music industry. Staff Abby calls it “an eye-opening and thought-provoking examination of the world&#8217;s largest streaming service and how it has shaped contemporary music creation and consumption – and not for the better.”</p>
  <p><a href="https://seattle.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S30C4010843"><strong>Love in a F*cked-up World: How to Build Relationships, Hook Up, and Raise Hell Together</strong></a> by Dean Spade<br />
  Spade examines dominant cultural narratives around relationships and the disservice they do to both romantic and platonic connections. Staff Marc calls it “a crucial resource about how to bring a care ethic into both our individual and collective struggles for liberation and healing.”</p>
  <p><a href="https://seattle.bibliocommons.com/v2/record/S30C4066948"><strong>Why I Love Horror: Essays on Horror Literature</strong></a> edited by Becky Siegel Spratford<br />
  Librarian and horror afficionado Spratford assembles an anthology of essays from popular contemporary horror writers, a love letter to the genre and an examination of horror’s appeal to diverse audiences. In their starred review, booklist said “the results are illuminating, moving, and inspiring.”</p>
