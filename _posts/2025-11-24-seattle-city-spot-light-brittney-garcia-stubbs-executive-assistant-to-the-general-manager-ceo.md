Brittney Garcia Stubbs serves as the Executive Assistant to the General Manager and CEO of Seattle City Light, a role she has held since August 2024. Her responsibilities encompass a wide range of tasks, including scheduling, travel arrangements, and document management, while also facilitating collaboration with the Executive and Leadership Teams to address significant challenges and develop forward-thinking solutions. She coordinates efforts with various Seattle City Light Business Units, the Mayor’s Office, City Council, and other city departments, reflecting the dynamic nature of her role.

Originally from Lake Oswego, Oregon, Brittney holds a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy. She enjoys spending weekends running outdoors, taking her standard poodle, Buggy, to the dog park, playing drums, shopping at Costco, and planning for the future. She values her curious nature and diverse interests, which have shaped her life journey across seven states. A cherished family tradition is "Pizza Fridays." If she could be any animal, she would choose to be an octopus for its wisdom and playful nature. Over the past year, she has learned to embrace uncertainty about the future while remaining prepared for whatever comes next.
