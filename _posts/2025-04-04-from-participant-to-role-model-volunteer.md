Rutha, a dedicated volunteer at Atlantic Street Center (ASC), reflects on her transformative experiences as a participant in the organization's programs. Growing up, she engaged in various activities, including the Teen Technology and After School programs, which helped her develop social skills and a sense of leadership. Rutha fondly remembers community events that emphasized connection and cultural appreciation, shaping her into the person she is today.

Now a program manager at Microsoft, Rutha credits her ASC mentorship and leadership experiences for enhancing her communication and advocacy skills, which she actively uses to support others. Motivated by her positive experiences, she began volunteering after her manager proposed monthly give-back events. Rutha is committed to mentoring others and expanding ASC's impact by fostering collaboration and community involvement.

She believes volunteering strengthens communities and empowers individuals, creating lasting connections and support systems. Rutha's journey from participant to role model illustrates the profound influence that local organizations like ASC can have on individuals and their communities.
