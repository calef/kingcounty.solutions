El Centro de la Raza recently welcomed exceptional students from the University of Washington and Seattle University into their Internship and Work-Study programs. These students contributed significantly to various projects, enhancing El Centro's mission across multiple departments. Their engagement allowed the organization to expand its outreach, strengthen community ties, and improve programming effectiveness. 

Notably, the Communications and Digital Media Interns were instrumental in creating a marketing strategy for the El Centro Skate Rink, which improved customer service and boosted social media engagement. Additionally, the Procurement Intern played a vital role in the success of the Building the Beloved Community Gala by managing the auction process, securing in-kind donations, and ensuring a smooth experience for all guests and donors. 

The interns' efforts have had a lasting influence on both the programs they supported and the individuals and families served by El Centro de la Raza, reflecting their commitment to community betterment. The organization expresses heartfelt gratitude for the support received, underscoring the importance of these contributions to their mission.
