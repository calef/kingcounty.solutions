GiveBIG is an annual fundraising campaign in Washington that encourages individuals and organizations to support their communities. This year's "Big Days" are on May 6 and 7, with early giving already underway. Westside Neighbors Shelter has set a fundraising goal of $10,000 to continue providing essential services such as hot meals, warm clothing, hygiene products, and support for individuals experiencing homelessness. The organization emphasizes the importance of each client and invites the community to contribute to this cause. Donations can be made to help the shelter achieve its goal and further assist those in need.
