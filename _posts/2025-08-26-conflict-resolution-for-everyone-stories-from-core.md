  <p>At its heart, <a href="https://kcdrc.org/core/">CoRE™</a>, Conflict Resolution for Everyone, is about people. The emphasis is on everyone. Each person brings their own history, values, and lived experiences into the room. When we slow down, listen, and learn from each other, conflict resolution becomes less about fixing problems and more about building understanding.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4>Carmen: A Guide Shaped by Experience</h4>
  <p>For Carmen, a CoRE™ Learning Guide and Mediator, the roots of conflict are personal. Growing up in southern Colorado, she witnessed how systemic inequities created tension and exclusion. Latinos, she recalls, <img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-10948" src="https://kcdrc.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Carmen-A-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" /> were often met with skepticism and condescension when they stepped into spaces reserved for privilege. Conflict was not abstract; it was woven into daily life.</p>
  <p>Years later, managing a municipal office in Boulder, she found herself drawn to mediation. Bilingual in English and Spanish, Carmen often worked on cases where language and cultural differences complicated already difficult situations. Mediation became a way to build bridges where walls might otherwise rise.</p>
  <p>What excites her most about CoRE™ is the chance to pass these skills on. “Mediation applies to so many aspects of life,” she reflects. “Each new mediator becomes someone who can help make society more functional, or maybe just a little less dysfunctional.”</p>
  <p>In the CoRE™ teaching space, Carmen brings patience, curiosity, and a simple question: “What would you most like the other party to understand about you?” That shift, away from numbers or demands and toward human truths, opens the door to real connection.</p>
  <p>One mediation she recalls involved a landlord and an immigrant tenant, locked in a dispute over a showerhead. On the surface, it was about plumbing. Underneath, it was about exhaustion, dignity, and misunderstanding. The landlord thought he was helping by installing a low-flow fixture. The tenant, coming home from physical labor, needed something stronger. Neither was wrong, but without insight into each other’s realities, both assumed bad intentions.</p>
  <p>For Carmen, that moment crystallized why this work matters. Even neighbors can live in different worlds. Mediation offers a way to bridge them.</p>

  <h4>Tristan: A Learner Driven by Curiosity and Care</h4>
  <p>Tristan came to CoRE™ from a very different path. A consulting arborist and landscape architect, she spends her days navigating the tensions between development and conservation, people and place. These<img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-15227" src="https://kcdrc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tristan-225x300.jpeg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://kcdrc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tristan-225x300.jpeg 225w, https://kcdrc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tristan-769x1024.jpeg 769w, https://kcdrc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tristan-768x1022.jpeg 768w, https://kcdrc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tristan-1154x1536.jpeg 1154w, https://kcdrc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tristan-1539x2048.jpeg 1539w, https://kcdrc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tristan-1080x1438.jpeg 1080w, https://kcdrc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Tristan-scaled.jpeg 1923w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /> intersections have taught her that technical expertise is not enough. What often matters most is how people communicate when values collide.</p>
  <p>Her approach to conflict is also shaped by her identity and background. “I identify as a woman and come from a low-income background in the Pacific Northwest. These experiences inform how I move through the world—with humility, awareness, and a commitment to inclusion. I feel closely tied to the ecological and human communities of this region.”</p>
  <p>Curious and grounded, Tristan joined CoRE™ to deepen her skills in listening and conflict de-escalation. At first, she thought of mediation mostly as a tool for settling disputes. But as she practiced with others in the program, her perspective shifted. Conflict, she realized, is not something to avoid or rush through. It can be an opening, a chance to slow down, hear each other fully, and transform relationships. A role-play about workplace tension brought this home. In just a few minutes, she saw how quickly assumptions take hold and how powerful it can be to pause before reacting.</p>
  <p>For Tristan, conflict resolution now means creating space for all voices, naming what lies beneath the surface, and seeking mutual respect even when agreement is not possible. She carries these skills into her work with agencies and advisory boards, but also into daily conversations, friendships, and community life.</p>
  <p>“CoRE™ gave me something rare,” she reflects. “The space to practice listening and be in conversation with people who care deeply about justice and repair.”</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h4>The Power of Everyone</h4>
  <p>Carmen and Tristan entered CoRE™ from different places, one as a guide and the other as a learner. Yet both show us how conflict resolution is not the domain of a select few. It is something everyone can learn, carry, and share.</p>
  <p>For Carmen, the practice is about raising a son with empathy and building a more functional society. For Tristan, it is about navigating community decisions and nurturing equity in professional spaces. Both believe the future depends on our ability to listen, understand, and connect across differences.</p>
  <p>That is the power of CoRE™. It is Conflict Resolution for Everyone. Not just for mediators or professionals. It is for neighbors, parents, coworkers, leaders, and friends. It is for all of us.</p>

CoRE™ (Conflict Resolution for Everyone) emphasizes the importance of understanding people’s diverse histories and experiences in conflict resolution. Carmen, a learning guide and mediator, shares her journey shaped by witnessing systemic inequities and how mediation became a tool for building bridges across cultural divides. She highlights the significance of empathy, recalling a mediation involving a landlord and an immigrant tenant where misunderstanding stemmed from differing needs rather than intentions. 

Tristan, a consulting arborist and landscape architect, entered CoRE™ to enhance her conflict de-escalation skills. She realized that conflict can serve as an opportunity for deeper understanding and transformation in relationships. Both Carmen and Tristan illustrate that conflict resolution is accessible to all and is essential for fostering empathy and functional communities. They believe that the ability to listen and connect across differences is crucial for the future, making conflict resolution a vital skill for everyone, not just professionals.
