  and better initial individual performance using BMR’s software. One story: A former
  Navy Petty Officer with no manufacturing experience landed a manufacturing team
  lead position because of what he brought to the table (leadership, critical thinking,
  problem-solving, communication) even though he hadn’t ever sat in the chair. Already,
  he is a top performer in their Southern California plant and is even leading their
  local Veteran Resource Group.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What employers

  shortlists and interview the top three candidates per role.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Track
  two metrics: time-to-interview and 90-day retention.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What

Veterans and service members can now utilize a new tool that helps translate their military experience into civilian job qualifications. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has launched a comprehensive mapping tool that connects military skills to civilian career opportunities. This tool is part of the VA's effort to support veterans in their transition to civilian life by providing a clearer understanding of how their military training and experience align with various job roles in the civilian workforce.

By inputting their military occupation or skills, users can receive tailored job recommendations that match their qualifications. The tool includes a wide range of industries and occupations, making it easier for veterans to identify potential career paths that suit their expertise. This initiative aims to enhance employment opportunities for veterans and streamline the transition process, ultimately aiding in their integration into civilian society. The VA encourages service members and veterans to take advantage of this resource as part of their career planning and job search efforts.
