topics: []

Safer Signals is a pilot program in Bellevue utilizing LIDAR technology to enhance pedestrian safety at selected intersections. This technology tracks vehicles and individuals biking or walking, adjusting walk signal durations in real time for slower pedestrians. The initiative aims to improve safety and accessibility for all road users. Additionally, the latest Lake to Lake news show highlights the second annual Bellevue International Festival, which successfully attracted a large audience at Crossroads Park. Another focus is the Safe Speeds Bellevue project, which is examining the potential for lowering speed limits across various streets in Bellevue to enhance community safety.
