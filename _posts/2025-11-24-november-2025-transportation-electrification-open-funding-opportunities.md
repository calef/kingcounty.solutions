Washington State is offering several funding opportunities for transportation electrification. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has launched the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, providing $10 billion to manufacturers of advanced technology vehicles and components that meet specific fuel economy targets. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis.

The Washington Department of Commerce is administering the WA EV Charging Program 2 (WAEVCP 2), which has $19.4 million available for public agencies, tribal entities, retail electric utilities, nonprofits, and private entities to fund charging infrastructure for multifamily residential, publicly accessible, fleet, or workplace needs. Applications are due by December 18, 2025, at 4 p.m.

Additionally, the Washington Department of Ecology's Rails, Keels, and Wheels program offers approximately $25 million for organizations in Washington to transition medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, such as switcher locomotives and tugboats, to all-electric models to reduce diesel emissions. The application deadline for this program is January 8, 2026. Further details on past and future funding opportunities can be found in the EV Council Program Catalog.
