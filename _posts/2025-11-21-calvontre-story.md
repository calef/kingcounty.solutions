After a challenging pregnancy and Cayden's early birth at 33 weeks, his family faced an unexpected diagnosis of Cardio-Facio-Cutaneous Syndrome two weeks after his arrival. This rare condition brought numerous health concerns, leading the family into a whirlwind of medical referrals and assessments. They connected with Boyer Children's Clinic, where a dedicated team of therapists, including a family coordinator, occupational, physical, speech, and vision therapists, began working with Cayden after he left the NICU at three months old. The family's experience has been profoundly influenced by this support, which has aided not only Cayden's development but also helped his parents navigate the complexities of parenting a child with special needs. They received guidance on therapy, feeding strategies, and insurance for medical equipment, all aimed at maximizing Cayden's potential. Mairin, Cayden's mother, expresses deep gratitude for the team's invaluable support and acknowledges the emotional challenges of seeing Cayden graduate from the program at age three, as they have become like family. Cayden's hard work and determination to achieve his milestones are a testament to the collaborative efforts of his care team at Boyer.
