Mercer Island's Department of Youth and Family Services (YFS) is accepting donations to assist residents facing food insecurity due to reduced SNAP benefits amid the federal government shutdown. YFS collaborates with Bellevue’s Hopelink to provide a Mobile Market every two weeks for fresh food access and connects families to regional food programs. To help, YFS encourages donations of $25 gift cards for local grocery stores, which will be distributed to those in need. For inquiries or to donate, contact YFS Programs Coordinator Marina Gonzales. The MIYFS Foundation also accepts donations to support YFS initiatives.
