MSC is committed to enhancing equitable access to advocacy, opportunity, and well-being by removing barriers that hinder individuals from receiving assistance. Last fiscal year, MSC served 111,736 individuals, marking a 161% increase over two years. This growth is attributed not only to rising demand but also to flexible program requirements, targeted outreach to previously underserved communities, and the introduction of online applications for services. The diversity of clients served includes 25% under 18 years old and 26% over 55. In terms of housing, 56% rent, 32% own, and 2% are unhoused. Notably, 70% of food bank clients identify as Black, Indigenous, or People of Color, with this figure ranging from 63% to 92% in various economic opportunity programs. These statistics highlight the effectiveness of MSC's intentional, equity-centered strategies aimed at meeting individuals where they are, ensuring that everyone has access to the support they need. The demographic data collected reflects a majority of clients, while confidentiality measures mean not all programs require this information to be reported.
