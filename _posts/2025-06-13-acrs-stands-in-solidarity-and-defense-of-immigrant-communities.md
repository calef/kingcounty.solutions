ACRS expresses solidarity with immigrant communities affected by recent immigration enforcement actions, including raids and increased law enforcement activity. The organization highlights the deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles and the deportation of 160 individuals to Laos and Vietnam, marking significant distress and fear within immigrant families. Many individuals are now afraid to engage in daily activities such as going to work or school. ACRS emphasizes its commitment to support vulnerable communities and encourages individuals to stay informed, utilizing their Know Your Rights resources to navigate potential immigration enforcement. Local protests have occurred in Seattle with more planned, and ACRS urges community members to take action safely and in alignment with their values. The organization remains dedicated to advocating for humane policies, supporting family unity, and protecting the rights of all communities. ACRS reaffirms its role in providing culturally responsive services and assures those affected that they are not alone, pledging ongoing support in their pursuit of safety and justice.
