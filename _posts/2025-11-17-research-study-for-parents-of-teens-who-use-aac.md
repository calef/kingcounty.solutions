The Language, Assistive Technology, and Autism (LATA) Lab at The Ohio State University is conducting a research study aimed at parents and legal guardians of transition-age AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) users, specifically those aged 14 to 22. This study, approved by the OSU Institutional Review Board, investigates family experiences during the transition from school to adult life.

Eligible participants must be parents or guardians of AAC users within the specified age range and residing in the United States. Participation involves completing a 15-30 minute online survey and uploading a photo of the AAC device used by the child, as well as the most recent Individualized Education Program (IEP) and Evaluation Team Report if available.

Interested individuals are encouraged to fill out an interest form to receive the necessary consent and assent materials. For any questions, participants can contact Meredith Suhr, a PhD student in the Department of Speech and Hearing Science. The study aims to enrich the understanding of developmental disabilities through research, particularly regarding the transition to adulthood for AAC users.
