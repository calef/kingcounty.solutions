  [St. John Vianney Catholic Church](https://sjvkirkland.org/) in Kirkland, lies three
  garden beds atop a woodchip base. During gardening season, you can usually find
  volunteers Kathleen and Jeanne gleaning here. In one glean alone, they harvested
  29 pounds of basil, carrots, kale, cucumbers, tomatoes, string beans, squash, and
  zucchini from the garden, all produce donated directly to the [Hopelink Food Market
  in Kirkland](https://www.hopelink.org/locations/kirkland-northshore/).&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nWith
  our famously wet winters and mild summers here in the Pacific Northwest, it’s no
  surprise that the region is teeming with backyard vegetable gardens and P-Patches.
  But come the end of summer when gardeners are plucking more zucchini than they can
  handle, Hopelink’s [Food Markets](https://www.hopelink.org/programs/food-program/)
  are happy to take them off their hands through the [Plant a Row, Share a Row campaign](https://www.hopelink.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Plant_a_Row_full_flyer.pdf).\n\nEstablished
  in 2014, Hopelink Harvest is the agency’s farm-direct program, partnering with regional
  farmers, community gardeners, and gleaning groups to source fresh, culturally relevant
  produce grown just miles away. In 2023, the program yielded 191,000 pounds of produce.&nbsp;\n\n“Food
  Markets are the foundation of the Hopelink Harvest program,” says Meghan Moore,
  Hopelink Harvest Program Supervisor. “The Harvest program builds relationships that
  allow for farm-direct purchasing and donations, with some growing crops specifically
  for Hopelink and other food access organizations.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nIn 2024, community
  members from the Social Justice Commission at the St. John Vianney Catholic Church
  came together to discuss better serving the community. “I just had this idea that
  maybe we could start a garden and donate all the food to Hopelink,” said Jeanne.&nbsp;\n\nThat
  April, Kathleen and Jeanne began sowing seeds, watching as tomato vines, spindly
  cucumber plants, and more sprang from the soil. By mid-September, the gardens had
  produced over 200 pounds of produce, all distributed at Hopelink Food Markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n“Many
  people might not realize that donating fresh produce is a viable and impactful way
  to support food banks\\*,” explains Jodi Peña, Hopelink Food Program Manager. “When
  people think of food donations, they often think of canned goods. But there’s a
  huge opportunity in fresh produce.”&nbsp;\n\nAccording to [Feeding America, Hunger
  & Poverty in King County](https://map.feedingamerica.org/county/2022/overall/washington/county/king),
  9.7% of people in King County are experiencing food insecurity and according to
  our 2022 [Community Needs Assessment](https://www.hopelink.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/HopelinkCNAJune2022-min.pdf),
  the cost of a healthy diet continues to rise.\n\n![A bounty of cherry tomatoes and

  the U.S. also faces an ever-growing epidemic of preventable diet-related chronic
  diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. The [U.S. Food &
  Drug Administration (FDA)](https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-food-labeling-and-critical-foods/fdas-nutrition-initiatives)
  finds improving nutrition through a healthy diet is one of the most effective public
  health interventions for reducing these and other chronic illnesses.&nbsp;\n\nHopelink
  Harvest’s approach is to enhance its partnership with a diverse range of growers,
  to include both large-scale contributors and smaller local gardening groups to continue
  providing fresh, healthy food to our clients.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n“Clients want to see
  all the things you would want to see at a grocery store, so we are working to change
  the perception that we only provide canned goods,” says Jodi. “We offer 10 to 12
  different varieties of produce, a full deli freezer filled with meat, eggs, and
  milk, and so much more. We’re really trying to meet people where they need to be
  met nutritionally.”&nbsp;\n\nA bounty of cherry tomatoes and carrots harvested from

  Harvest program aims to cultivate more garden donors by supporting and facilitating
  access to resources and knowledge in gardening. “And hopefully, they can support
  us by donating their produce,” says Meghan.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nEfforts in the emergence
  of donated fresh food options have gone one step further, with both farming partners
  and gardeners coordinating their production based on the specific needs of Hopelink’s
  Food Markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nFor example, founded in 2009, [Viva Farms](https://vivafarms.org/)
  is a nonprofit farm business incubator, supporting 35 farm businesses across Skagit
  and King Counties.&nbsp;\n\nViva Farms has partnered with Hopelink’s Food Assistance
  team since 2022 to provide culturally relevant, local, organic produce through bulk
  purchasing agreements. They coordinate large quantities of produce during peak seasons,
  helping Hopelink offer seasonal produce throughout the year.&nbsp;\n\n![2024 Community

  \"Local Gardeners Grow Bounties for Hopelink Food Markets   4\")\n\n“Viva Farms
  takes on all of the communication and delivery logistics, coordinating with nonprofits
  like Hopelink and individual farm businesses who supply produce ranging from mixed
  vegetables, herbs, and berries,” shared Katherine Myrvold, Sales and Education Manager
  at Viva Farms. “Usually, Hopelink tells us what they need, and we tell the farmers
  to begin harvesting. So far, it’s worked pretty smoothly.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nWhen Kathleen
  and Jeanne first started gardening for St. John Vianney Catholic Church, their produce
  included tomatoes, zucchini, squashes, some beans, and peas. “But then we spoke
  to some of the folks at Hopelink, and they suggested some herbs and some cabbages,”
  said Kathleen. “With three beds, plus a small garden that the preschoolers started,
  we’ve really been surprised at what has produced.”&nbsp;\n\n_Photo by Mel Martin
  for Hopelink_\n\nThe church has now donated herbs including basil, parsley, oregano,
  sage, and rosemary. Like produce, herbs, and seasonings can be expensive and hard
  to find at most food banks.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nWhether through larger, local farming
  partnerships like Viva Farms or community-based gardeners like St. John Vianney
  Church, each contribution makes a huge impact in the lives of many families and
  individuals experiencing food insecurity.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nThanks to the Harvest program’s
  innovative approach and community support, fresh produce is becoming more accessible
  to those who need it most. In the garden, as in life, it’s the blend of creativity
  and human touch that yields the most fruitful results.&nbsp;\n\n<style>\nfigcaption

Hopelink's Harvest Program is working to combat food insecurity in King County by partnering with local farmers, gardeners, and gleaning groups to provide fresh produce to their food markets. The program, which yielded 191,000 pounds of produce in 2023, aims to change the perception that food banks only provide canned goods. Instead, Hopelink offers a range of fresh vegetables, meat, eggs, and milk. St. John Vianney Catholic Church and Viva Farms are among those contributing produce. Hopelink encourages more garden donors and coordinates with partners to meet specific needs of its Food Markets.
