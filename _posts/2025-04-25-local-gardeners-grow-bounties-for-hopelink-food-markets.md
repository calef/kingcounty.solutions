Hopelink's Harvest Program is working to combat food insecurity in King County by partnering with local farmers, gardeners, and gleaning groups to provide fresh produce to their food markets. The program, which yielded 191,000 pounds of produce in 2023, aims to change the perception that food banks only provide canned goods. Instead, Hopelink offers a range of fresh vegetables, meat, eggs, and milk. St. John Vianney Catholic Church and Viva Farms are among those contributing produce. Hopelink encourages more garden donors and coordinates with partners to meet specific needs of its Food Markets.
