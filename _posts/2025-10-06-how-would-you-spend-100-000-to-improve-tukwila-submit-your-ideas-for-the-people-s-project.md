Tukwila City is inviting its residents to participate in the People’s Project, a new initiative that allows community members to decide how to invest $100,000 in funds for small, visible improvements in the city. From October 1 to November 15, residents can submit their ideas via an Idea Submission Form available in multiple languages. The steering committee overseeing this initiative comprises residents from diverse backgrounds and neighborhoods, ensuring a fair and inclusive process. The initiative is part of Tukwila's participatory budgeting strategy.
