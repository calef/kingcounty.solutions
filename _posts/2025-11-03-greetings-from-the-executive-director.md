As the days grow darker and colder, The Center for Active Living remains a warm and active space for its members. Executive Director Amy Lee Derenthal expresses gratitude for the community's support. During the annual retreat held in September, staff and board members identified key projects for the upcoming year. Plans include expanding hours by introducing late afternoon or evening programs weekly, enhancing the Thrift Store experience with improved displays and signage, and engaging in local events. Additionally, the Center aims to ensure future financial stability by building reserves for operations and maintenance, as well as planning for potential capital projects. Updates on these initiatives will be shared as progress is made. Happy holidays are wished to all members.
