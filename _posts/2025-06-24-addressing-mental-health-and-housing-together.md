  At Solid Ground, we know that homelessness and other traumatic experiences are deeply interconnected with behavioral health, which means we’re far more effective supporting people to build stability in their lives when working holistically to address housing and health in tandem.

  Unfortunately, behavioral health care remains out of reach for many people who’ve experienced homelessness and live on low incomes. That’s why Solid Ground works to improve the health and well-being of people living at our [Sand Point Housing](https://www.solid-ground.org/what-we-do/housing-homelessness/#sandpointhousing) campus through free onsite behavioral health support services to improve access to and engagement with mental health care for adults, children, and youth – helping individuals heal from trauma and families begin to disrupt generational cycles of poverty.&nbsp;

  This past quarter, we were thrilled to renew our partnership with [Virginia Mason Franciscan Health (VMFH)](https://www.vmfh.org/) through their CommonSpirit Community Health Improvement Grants. This is the second year VMFH has helped fund Sand Point’s Behavioral Health Partnerships, aligning with their mission to address some of our region’s most pressing health needs, from access to care and behavioral health, to chronic disease and violence prevention.&nbsp;

At Solid Ground, the interconnection between homelessness and behavioral health is recognized as vital for effective support. The organization provides free onsite behavioral health services at its Sand Point Housing campus, aimed at improving access to mental health care for individuals and families, especially those from low-income backgrounds. Recent funding from Virginia Mason Franciscan Health (VMFH) through the CommonSpirit Community Health Improvement Grants has renewed efforts to enhance these services. VMFH's partnership enables Solid Ground to collaborate with specialized providers who share residents' experiences, offering tailored support for conditions such as depression and anxiety. This year, the focus is on expanding services for children and youth, including group activities that teach trauma management and emotional intelligence. VMFH emphasizes its commitment to community well-being and social justice through these grants, supporting local organizations in addressing significant health needs. The initiative aims to remove barriers to behavioral health care, fostering equitable health outcomes for families facing poverty, domestic violence, and systemic challenges. Solid Ground continues to seek new partnerships and appreciates the support from various grant partners that contribute to its mission of building pathways out of poverty.
