To recover your password, start by locating the "Forgot Password?" link on the login page of the website or service. Click this link, and you will typically be prompted to enter your email address or username associated with the account. After submission, check your email for a password reset link. Follow the instructions in the email, which often involves clicking the link to navigate to a page where you can create a new password.

Ensure your new password is strong and unique, incorporating a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. Some services may require you to answer security questions or provide additional verification, such as a code sent to your phone or email. If you do not receive the reset email, check your spam or junk folder. If issues persist, consider reaching out to the service's customer support for further assistance. 

Once your password is reset, remember to log in with the new password and consider updating your security settings, such as enabling two-factor authentication for added protection. Regularly updating your passwords and using a password manager can help maintain your account security.
