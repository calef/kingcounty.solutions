title: New traffic signals coming to SR 522 to support I-405 expansion in Bothell

Big changes are coming to the Interstate 405/State Route 522 interchange in Bothell, with new traffic signals set to be operational by Nov. 24. These signals will manage traffic at two new intersections on SR 522, supporting a newly constructed northbound I-405 ramp to SR 522 and adding an additional lane to the heavily trafficked eastbound ramp to Woodinville. The changes are part of the I-405/Brickyard to SR 527 Improvement Project, which aims to expand capacity and improve mobility on 4.5 miles of I-405.

Drivers should anticipate delays as construction continues, with initial traffic flows limited to two lanes. WSDOT traffic engineers will work to optimize signal timing to reduce delays. Ultimately, three new intersections with traffic signals will be established, and the new system is expected to add about one minute to peak-hour travel times on SR 522. Future plans include demolishing the former flyover ramp and loop ramps in early 2026, which will also involve weekend closures. These upgrades are designed to enhance traffic flow, support the new express toll lanes, and improve transit options, including the Stride Bus Rapid Transit service.
