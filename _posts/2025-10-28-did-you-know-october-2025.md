Today, on Indigenous Peoples’ Day, Paula Matta Marroquin, a Mapuche and refugee, reflects on her identity and journey from Chile. She emphasizes the deep roots her Indigenous heritage provides, highlighting the loss and resilience experienced in her journey. Marroquin articulates a profound connection to her ancestors, stating that being Indigenous transcends geography, rooted in relationships with the earth, elders, and community.

She honors not only her own people but all Indigenous nations worldwide, celebrating their ongoing fight to preserve their languages and cultures against historical silencing and violence. Marroquin underlines the responsibility of communities to protect displaced families and children, advocating for their safety, dignity, and the continuation of their cultural traditions.

Indigenous Peoples’ Day, she asserts, is a moment for recognition, care, connection, and action, reminding everyone that their struggles are interconnected. She celebrates her culture and the wisdom of her ancestors, pledging to honor their legacy by advocating for those who cannot speak for themselves. Marroquin concludes with a message of unity and resilience, affirming her identity and commitment to her heritage.
