  <p><strong>Indigenous Peoples’ Day Speech</strong> By Paula Matta Marroquin Mapuche </p>



  <pre class="wp-block-verse">Küme tünngün, pu lamngen — greetings, my relatives.</pre>



  <p>Today, on Indigenous Peoples’ Day, I stand before you not just as a refugee, but as an Indigenous person whose roots run deep in the lands of Chile — lands my ancestors cared for long before borders or nations existed.</p>



  <p>My journey from my homeland to this one has been one of both loss and resilience. I left behind mountains that remember my people’s songs, rivers that still whisper our stories. But I carry them with me — in my language, in my spirit, and in my fight to be seen and heard.</p>



  <p>Being a refugee means you are forced to leave home.<br>Being Indigenous means your home never leaves you.</p>



  <p>Wherever I go, I bring the memory of my people’s strength — the same strength that kept us alive through colonization, erasure, and exile. Even far from home, I remain connected to my ancestors, because being Indigenous is not just about geography. It is about relationship — with the earth, with our elders, with each other.</p>



  <p>On this day, I honor not only my people in Chile, but all Indigenous nations across the world who continue to rise — who speak their languages despite centuries of silencing, who defend the land despite violence, who teach their children to be proud of who they are.</p>



  <p>And I also want to remind us of our responsibility — to protect our refugee families and children. Those who have been displaced, who have lost their homes, who carry their hopes and traditions across borders. They deserve safety, dignity, and a future where their cultures can continue to grow and flourish. Protecting them is protecting the heartbeat of humanity itself.</p>



  <p>Indigenous Peoples’ Day is not just a day of recognition — it is a day of care, connection, and action. A day to remember that our struggles are linked, and that healing comes through community.</p>



  <p>Today, I celebrate the beauty of my culture, the wisdom of my ancestors, and the solidarity of all who walk this path of remembrance and resistance.</p>



  <p>From the land of my birth to the land where I now stand — I am still Indigenous.<br>And as long as I breathe, I will honor my ancestors by speaking their truth and standing for those who cannot.</p>



  <p>Mari mari, kom pu che — thank you, all my relations&nbsp;</p>

  Mapuche\n\n    Küme tünngün, pu lamngen — greetings, my relatives.\n\nToday, on
  Indigenous Peoples’ Day, I stand before you not just as a refugee, but as an Indigenous
  person whose roots run deep in the lands of Chile — lands my ancestors cared for
  long before borders or nations existed.\n\nMy journey from my homeland to this one
  has been one of both loss and resilience. I left behind mountains that remember
  my people’s songs, rivers that still whisper our stories. But I carry them with
  me — in my language, in my spirit, and in my fight to be seen and heard.\n\nBeing
  a refugee means you are forced to leave home.  \nBeing Indigenous means your home
  never leaves you.\n\nWherever I go, I bring the memory of my people’s strength —
  the same strength that kept us alive through colonization, erasure, and exile. Even
  far from home, I remain connected to my ancestors, because being Indigenous is not
  just about geography. It is about relationship — with the earth, with our elders,
  with each other.\n\nOn this day, I honor not only my people in Chile, but all Indigenous
  nations across the world who continue to rise — who speak their languages despite
  centuries of silencing, who defend the land despite violence, who teach their children
