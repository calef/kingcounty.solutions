  In 2025, KCLS made meaningful strides in supporting our staff and strengthening our trauma-informed approach to emergency responses. We standardized emergency support for staff responses and launched an alert system for emergency situations. We formalized procedures for crisis debriefing to ensure consistent support for staff when they face high-stress situations. We enhanced and promoted our employee accommodations process to provide clearer pathways for staff to request accommodation. Biannual regional librarian retreats became a cornerstone for building connections and shared learning. Our Operational Staffing Support (OSS) program brought responsive solutions to critical staffing challenges by allowing managers to fill shifts with substitutes across regions.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  In 2026, we're building on this momentum. We're enhancing onboarding to foster deeper belonging and piloting innovative positions with on-the-job training and development. We’re also expanding beyond traditional career ladders to explore diverse pathways and alternative routes to promotion. Through all our staffing strategies, we remain committed to one goal: empowering every team member to thrive.&nbsp;
