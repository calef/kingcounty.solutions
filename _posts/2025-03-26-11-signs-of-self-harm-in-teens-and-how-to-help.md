Teens face significant pressures that can lead to self-harm, a concerning behavior in adolescent mental health. Self-harm often serves to express inner pain or distract from emotional distress. Factors contributing to self-harm include school pressures, traumatic life events, social issues, low self-esteem, and body image concerns. 

Signs of self-harm in teens may not be limited to physical injuries. Indicators include unexplained cuts or bruises, carrying sharp objects, sudden changes in clothing choices, risky behaviors, substance abuse, extreme exercise, and withdrawal from social interactions. 

To help a teen showing signs of self-harm, open communication is vital. Listening without judgment and reassuring them of support can encourage them to share their feelings. It's important to guide the conversation with empathy and patience. Offering alternative coping strategies, such as journaling, engaging in physical activities, or practicing mindfulness, can also help. 

If self-harm persists, connecting the teen with mental health care is essential. Options like intensive outpatient programs or residential treatment centers can provide necessary support and help them develop healthier coping mechanisms to replace self-harm.
