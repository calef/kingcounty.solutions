My name is Lucy Partington, and I am the Communications and Marketing Intern at Angel Flight West (AFW) for the Spring 2025 semester. As a Public Relations, Advertising, and Entertainment Marketing major at Chapman University, I sought this internship to advance my professional journey. It has been a transformative experience, allowing me to learn about AFW’s mission and its profound impact on individuals' lives. I enhanced my visual storytelling skills by producing videos, including passenger and pilot stories, and a "who we are" video. The highlight of my internship was creating a passenger story about Jerry and his family, which deepened my understanding of AFW's work. I also improved my marketing writing skills and gained familiarity with platforms like Canva, Mailchimp, and WordPress. Collaboration has been key, and I cherished attending the Endeavor Awards, where I met the team and witnessed the fundraising efforts firsthand. This internship has fostered my professional and personal growth, helping me learn about my values and enhancing my communication and time management skills in a remote working environment.
