  <p>My name is Lucy Partington, and I have been interning at Angel Flight West (AFW) as the Communications and Marketing Intern for the Spring 2025 semester. I am currently a student at Chapman University, majoring in Public Relations, Advertising, and Entertainment Marketing at Dodge College of Film and Media Arts. With a background in video production and social media, I was initially drawn to the internship as I thought it would be the perfect next step in my professional journey. However, it quickly turned into much more than that. Throughout my internship, I’ve been able to learn every aspect of AFW’s mission and have been amazed by the impact it has on so many people’s lives.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>This role allowed me to grow my experience in visual storytelling by producing several meaningful videos for AFW, including passenger and pilot stories, a “who we are” video using existing footage, and various reels. The most rewarding task of my internship was producing a passenger story about Jerry and his family. As this was one of the first videos I created, I was able to grasp, early on in my internship, the true impact that AFW has on so many lives. It sharpened my focus, knowing the difference being made with the work I was assigned. I’ve also seen growth in my marketing writing skills by writing articles for AFW’s blog, as well as expanding my knowledge in professional platforms such as Canva, Mailchimp, and WordPress.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Throughout my internship, collaboration was at the forefront. It has been an honor to work alongside such a dedicated and passionate team, all working toward a fantastic cause. My favorite memory from the internship was attending the Endeavor Awards, where I spent my time capturing content to share throughout the night. This was such an incredible event to be a part of. I was able, for the first time, to meet the team in person and celebrate the work we had done together. Not only that, but seeing the fundraising in real time and feeling the love for AFW from the guests will be something that stays with me forever.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Overall, my time at AFW has allowed me to grow both professionally and personally. I was able to learn more about myself and what I value in both a career and life. Working remotely with the team has strengthened my listening and questioning skills and solidified my time management abilities. It has also given me much-needed experience in a remote setting, providing flexibility for my career path.&nbsp;</p>

My name is Lucy Partington, and I am the Communications and Marketing Intern at Angel Flight West (AFW) for the Spring 2025 semester. As a Public Relations, Advertising, and Entertainment Marketing major at Chapman University, I sought this internship to advance my professional journey. It has been a transformative experience, allowing me to learn about AFW’s mission and its profound impact on individuals' lives. I enhanced my visual storytelling skills by producing videos, including passenger and pilot stories, and a "who we are" video. The highlight of my internship was creating a passenger story about Jerry and his family, which deepened my understanding of AFW's work. I also improved my marketing writing skills and gained familiarity with platforms like Canva, Mailchimp, and WordPress. Collaboration has been key, and I cherished attending the Endeavor Awards, where I met the team and witnessed the fundraising efforts firsthand. This internship has fostered my professional and personal growth, helping me learn about my values and enhancing my communication and time management skills in a remote working environment.
