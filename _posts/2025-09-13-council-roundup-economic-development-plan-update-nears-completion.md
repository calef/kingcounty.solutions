title: 'Council Roundup: Economic Development Plan update nears completion'
topics: []
---

The Bellevue City Council recently reviewed updates to the Economic Development Plan, aiming for adoption in December. The plan highlights a 39% rise in median household income from 2018 to 2023, adding over 10,000 jobs, particularly in downtown, which has seen substantial growth in office space. The creative economy remains a significant contributor, accounting for 37% of the region's gross product, with potential growth in sectors like life sciences and AI. 

Additionally, the council approved boundary adjustments with Kirkland to ensure the South Kirkland Park & Ride and the Cross Kirkland Corridor trail are fully within Kirkland, facilitating future development without impacting Bellevue’s population or tax revenue. 

The council also amended rules regarding exclusion from meetings for decorum violations, increasing the maximum exclusion period from 60 to 180 days and limiting terms for advisory board members to two consecutive terms. 

Proclamations were made for Eastside Welcoming Week, National Service Dog Month, and Hunger Action Awareness Month, with events planned for September 15-21.
