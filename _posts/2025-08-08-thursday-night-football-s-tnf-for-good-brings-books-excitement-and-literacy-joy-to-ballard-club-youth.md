In late July, the Ballard Boys & Girls Club hosted an exciting literacy event, TNF For Good, in collaboration with Amazon, the NFL’s Inspire Change initiative, and the Smithsonian. This initiative brought joy and inspiration to the youth in King County, offering hundreds of books at the Ballard Club and over 1,000 to Club youth across the region. Children were welcomed with enthusiasm and had the opportunity to select Smithsonian-curated books to take home, fostering their love for reading. With the presence of Seahawks legend Ben Obomanu, dancers, and mascot Blitz, youth participated in engaging literacy activities and storytelling sessions, enriching their learning experiences. The diverse selection of stories allowed participants to explore various genres and cultural perspectives, nurturing their imaginations and aspirations. Many families depend on Clubs during the summer for safe and stimulating environments for their children. Lori Bae, CEO of Boys & Girls Clubs of King County, emphasized the importance of these events in sparking a love for reading and supporting youth in realizing their potential. Overall, TNF For Good provided not just books, but also a message of affirmation regarding the importance of their stories and futures.
