Jose Pizarro, Interim Program Director at YouthCare, shares a personal plea for support as winter approaches, highlighting the plight of hundreds of young people in Seattle experiencing homelessness. Many sleep outside in harsh conditions, and YouthCare has long been a vital resource for these youth, providing shelter and life-changing services. Donations are crucial for continuing this support, symbolizing hope and security for those in need.

The article also features the story of Carrie, a 15-year-old who faced years of housing instability and an unsafe home environment due to her mother’s struggles with addiction. Upon arriving at YouthCare, Carrie began to heal, reconnecting with healthcare providers, catching up on school, and working towards a safer home through family counseling. By August, she was ready to return home, marking a significant turnaround in her life.

Additionally, YouthCare recognizes the important contributions of volunteers who deliver meals to young people and announces its receipt of a Certificate of Appreciation from the City of Seattle for its commitment to supporting survivors of gender-based violence. As winter approaches, YouthCare is in need of various supplies to assist its clients.
