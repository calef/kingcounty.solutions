  <p><strong>We&#8217;re on a Mission to Save our Shelters</strong></p>



  <p>My name is Jose Pizarro, and I serve as the Interim Program Director at YouthCare, where I’ve helped young people build stability and take their first steps toward independence for over a decade. For me, this work is deeply personal. As an immigrant who once faced homelessness myself, I know what it feels like to start with nothing, scared and alone, and fighting to survive in a system not designed for people like me. &nbsp;In some ways, that’s where YouthCare finds itself today. And that’s why I’m reaching out to you with a heartfelt plea for help.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Every night, hundreds of young people sleep outside on the streets of Seattle huddled under overpasses, in doorways, or in makeshift tents, trying to stay warm and dry as relentless rain soaks through their clothes. As winter approaches, survival becomes a battle against the elements. For many, each night without shelter is a test of endurance no one should ever have to face. And for decades, YouthCare has been a constant in the storm—a dependable and critical part of the solution that says: that test is over.&nbsp;</p>



  <p><strong>Here’s the truth: Our shelters and life-changing services, and the futures of the youth who depend on them, rest in the hands of people like you who refuse to look away.&nbsp;</strong></p>



  <p>Your gift today, no matter the amount, symbolizes refuge from the storm. It’s a bed for a 12-year-old who hasn’t slept indoors in weeks. It’s a hot meal for someone who hasn’t felt full in days. It’s a steady, compassionate presence that helps a young person believe in a future for themselves.</p>



  <p>Thank you for standing with us and believing in our youth.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>With gratitude,&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Jose Pizarro&nbsp;<br>Interim Program Director, YouthCare</p>

  <p><strong>A 15 Year Old&#8217;s Journey in Our Adolescent Shelter</strong></p>



  <p>When 15-year-old Carrie arrived at one of YouthCare’s shelters in May, she arrived carrying more than the contents of her backpack. She had been carrying the tremendous weight of years of housing instability, sharing with us during intake that the last time she felt truly safe and stable at home was when she was 7 years old.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Carrie’s home life had long been unpredictable and unsafe. Her mom was battling addiction and serious health challenges, and over time, her mom became abusive—sometimes physically, and often verbally and emotionally. For Carrie, every day felt like a challenge to stay out of the line of fire and find a moment of peace. By the time she arrived at YouthCare, she had been in and out of her home more than a dozen times, often with nowhere safe to go. She felt anything was better than going home.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>The weight of her past showed up in many ways: anxiety, depression, symptoms of PTSD, and the deep exhaustion that comes from years of instability. She had stopped taking her behavioral health medications, fallen behind in school, and struggled with self-care. At YouthCare, she began to rebuild. With support from her case manager, she reconnected with a doctor and a therapist, restarted her medications, and got up to date on medical, dental, and vision care. For the first time in years, Carrie began to feel cared, and capable of caring for herself. She enrolled in summer and online classes, determined to catch up and move forward on her own terms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p>As Carrie regained her footing, YouthCare’s team began working closely with her and her mom toward a shared goal: rebuilding trust and creating a safer home for her to return to. Through family counseling and gradual overnight visits, both took courageous steps toward healing and reunification. By August, just three months after Carrie arrived, she and her mom found themselves in a place where hope felt possible again, and they were ready for a fresh start.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>On August 10, Carrie packed her things—not because she had to leave, but because she finally had somewhere safe to return to. &nbsp;</p>



  <p>Carrie’s story is one of many that remind us what’s possible when young people are met with safety, compassion, and opportunity. With YouthCare’s support, Carrie found healing, stability, confidence, and the courage to find a path forward.&nbsp;</p>

Jose Pizarro, interim program director at YouthCare, shares a personal plea for support as winter approaches, highlighting the plight of hundreds of young people in Seattle experiencing homelessness. Many sleep outside in harsh conditions, and YouthCare has long been a vital resource for these youth, providing shelter and life-changing services. Donations are crucial for continuing this support, symbolizing hope and security for those in need.

The article also features the story of Carrie, a 15-year-old who faced years of housing instability and an unsafe home environment due to her mother’s struggles with addiction. Upon arriving at YouthCare, Carrie began to heal, reconnecting with healthcare providers, catching up on school, and working toward a safer home through family counseling. By August, she was ready to return home, marking a significant turnaround in her life.

Additionally, YouthCare recognizes the important contributions of volunteers who deliver meals to young people and announces its receipt of a Certificate of Appreciation from the City of Seattle for its commitment to supporting survivors of gender-based violence. As winter approaches, YouthCare is in need of various supplies to assist its clients.
