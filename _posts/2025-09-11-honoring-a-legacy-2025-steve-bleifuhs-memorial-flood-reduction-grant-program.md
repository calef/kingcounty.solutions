  The King County Flood Control District (KCFCD) is proud to announce the recipients of the 2025 Steve Bleifuhs Memorial Flood Reduction Grant Program. This year, the KCFCD awarded over $14.8 million in grant funding to 35 projects across King County. This is an investment that will reduce flood risks, restore fish passage, and strengthen the resilience of communities in every corner of the county.

  Created over a decade ago, the Flood Reduction Grant Program was designed to fund smaller, community-based projects that address local flooding issues. Over time, the program has expanded to include support for culvert replacement and fish passage, coastal flooding and erosion, and urban stream restoration. Cities, tribes, non-profits, homeowner associations, and special purpose districts are all eligible to apply for funding.

  In October 2024, the Board of Supervisors renamed the program to honor Steve Bleifuhs, a longtime King County leader in floodplain management who passed away in July 2024. Steve’s nearly three decades of service left a lasting mark on the county’s flood risk reduction work, including his leadership in the development of the 2006 Flood Hazard Management Plan and his collaboration on more than 370 capital projects since the KCFCD’s inception.

  ## **Investing in Communities Across King County**

  This year, the KCFCD received 37 grant applications totaling more than $30 million. With just over $13.8 million authorized in the budget, the KCFCD allocated a total of $14,803,601 to 35 projects thanks to unspent funds from prior years. The projects funded reflect a commitment to geographic equity, social and environmental justice, and strong partnerships. Projects range from culvert replacement in rural areas to community-led green stormwater infrastructure in urban neighborhoods.

  ## **Supervisor Support**

  ### District 1

  **Councilmember Rod Dembowski (District 1)** expressed appreciation for the five funded projects in his district:

  “Working with the Lake City community, I was pleased to secure King County Flood Control District support to acquire the property for the Lake City Floodplain Park Construction Project. I am excited to support continued funding for the project as work continues to reconnect this floodplain on Thornton Creek and reduce urban flooding in the surrounding neighborhood. I am also happy to see other important projects in Bothell, Kenmore, Seattle, and Shoreline receive significant resources to reduce flood risk and improve fish passage in those communities”

  ### District 2

  **Councilmember Girmay Zahilay (District 2)** highlighted the program’s equity benefits:

  “This program helps advance equity across King County, ensuring that resources reach the communities who need them most. I’m proud that two projects in District 2 received funding, including more than $188,000 for the yəhaw̓ Indigenous Creatives Collective’s Mapes Creek Restoration & Urban Flooding Reduction Project, which will remove a dam, restore habitat, and reduce flooding.”

  **Vice Chair Sarah Perry (District 3)** emphasized the program’s reach in her district:

  “District 3 received 11 projects this year, a testament to the broad needs and opportunities in our region. One project I want to highlight is the $200,000 awarded to the Snoqualmie Valley Preservation Alliance for BeaverWise, a balanced approach to reducing beaver-caused flooding while supporting farm viability and ecological health in the Snoqualmie Valley Agricultural Production District.”

  ### District 5

  **Councilmember De’Sean Quinn (District 5)** expressed gratitude for the six projects in his district:

  “I’m grateful for the six projects funded in District 5, spanning across Renton, Des Moines, and Normandy Park including $750,000 for the City of Tukwila’s Gilliam Creek Fish and Debris Passage and Habitat Enhancement. This project will help make meaningful improvements to fish passage between Gilliam Creek and the Green River and improve habitat conditions within lower Gilliam Creek. These flood grants are a big win for protecting our homes, businesses, and infrastructures in our district.”

  **Councilmember Pete von Reichbauer (District 7)** noted the program’s value in South King County:

  “The Flood Reduction Grant Program funds projects that help keep people and property safe. In District 7, four projects were funded, including $1 million for the S. 370th Street Culvert Replacement Project. This effort will substantially reduce flood risk, improve stream stability, add stormwater treatment, and restore fish passage. This is a win for both people and the environment.”

  ### District 8

  **Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda (District 8)** emphasized how the grant advances environmental justice:

  “This program provides opportunities to address environmental inequities across our county. In District 8, five projects received support, including $500,000 for ECOSS’s Duwamish Valley Industrial Greening Project. By partnering with local organizations, this project will deliver community-led green stormwater infrastructure that benefits residents in the Georgetown and South Park neighborhoods.”

  **Chair Reagan Dunn (District 9)** reflected on Steve Bleifuhs’s legacy:

  “Renaming this program in Steve’s honor was an important step in recognizing his vision and commitment to flood risk reduction. I am also pleased that two projects in District 9 were awarded funding, including $1 million to the City of Covington for the SE 256th Street Culvert Replacement Project, which will improve flood protection and fish passage on Little Soos Creek.”

  ## **Looking Ahead**

  The Steve Bleifuhs Memorial Flood Reduction Grant Program continues to support innovative, community-led solutions that protect lives, property, and natural resources across King County.
