The King County Flood Control District (KCFCD) has announced the recipients of the 2025 Steve Bleifuhs Memorial Flood Reduction Grant Program. This year, it awarded over $14.8 million to 35 projects across King County to reduce flood risks, restore fish passage, and strengthen community resilience. The grant program, renamed in 2024 to honor the late floodplain management leader Steve Bleifuhs, was initially designed for smaller, community-based projects addressing local flooding issues. It has since expanded to include support for culvert replacement, fish passage, coastal flooding and erosion, and urban stream restoration. Various entities are eligible to apply for funding, including cities, tribes, non-profits, homeowner associations, and special-purpose districts.
