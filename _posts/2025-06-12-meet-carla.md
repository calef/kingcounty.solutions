For 35 years, Carla lived in a small house on a lake in Washington, a state she cherished after a childhood of relocating. Following her retirement as a fashion buyer, she never anticipated facing homelessness. When her landlord sold the property post-pandemic, Carla sought a new home but found the housing market had drastically changed, making even modest apartments unaffordable. Consequently, she lived in her car, parked in a Fred Meyer’s lot, for 18 months. Despite these challenges, Carla maintained resilience and faith, which kept her hopeful. Eventually, she secured an apartment through Imagine Housing. With support from her case manager, Carla began to rebuild her life, cultivating gratitude for the small things often overlooked. Reflecting on her experience, she expressed joy in simple tasks, stating, “I’m so glad to have a floor to scrub, a floor to get dirty... it’s like, it’s a pleasure now.” This journey highlights the struggles many face in securing affordable housing and the importance of community support in overcoming such hardships.
