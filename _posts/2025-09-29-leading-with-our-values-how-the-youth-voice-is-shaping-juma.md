Over the past 30 years, Juma has employed over 11,000 young individuals, aiming to provide essential tools and resources to bridge the opportunity gap. As the program evolves to address the changing challenges faced by youth, Juma is increasingly incorporating youth voices into its development. Sanobar Sajan, Senior Director of Data Systems and Evaluation, emphasizes that Juma has always been a youth-led enterprise, but the focus is now broadening beyond operational roles. Recently, the Learning and Evaluations team has conducted focus groups to gather youth feedback on their experiences, creating a safe space for candid discussions. This feedback aims to enhance the formalization of alumni services, fostering connections among former participants and providing insights into the long-term impact of the YouthConnect program. Additionally, a new newsletter summarizing survey findings has been introduced to show youth that their input drives real change. Juma is committed to placing youth voices at the forefront of program design and impact measurement, acknowledging the importance of young people as partners in shaping the future of the organization. This approach reflects Juma's dedication to supporting the visions of youth for their own futures.
