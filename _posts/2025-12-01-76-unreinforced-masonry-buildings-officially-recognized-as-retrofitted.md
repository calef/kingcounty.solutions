title: 76 Unreinforced Masonry Buildings Officially Recognized as Retrofitted
topics: []
---

Seventy-six unreinforced masonry buildings in Seattle have been officially recognized as having undergone successful retrofitting. This designation marks a significant milestone in the city’s efforts to enhance safety and resilience against seismic events. The retrofitting process involves reinforcing these structures to better withstand earthquakes, addressing potential risks associated with their original construction methods. The city’s Department of Construction and Inspections confirmed the completion of the retrofitting work, which is part of a broader initiative to improve the safety of older buildings. Building owners, local officials, and community members have collaborated on this project to ensure that these historic structures remain safe for future generations. The recognition serves as an important step in the city’s ongoing commitment to public safety and disaster preparedness, particularly in light of Seattle's seismic risks. With this achievement, the retrofitting program demonstrates a proactive approach to preserving the architectural heritage of the city while prioritizing the safety of its residents.
