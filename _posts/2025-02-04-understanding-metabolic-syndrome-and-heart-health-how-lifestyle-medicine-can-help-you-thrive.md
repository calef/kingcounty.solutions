Metabolic syndrome affects approximately one in three adults in the U.S., significantly increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. Defined by a cluster of conditions such as abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, elevated blood sugar, and abnormal cholesterol levels, it can lead to serious health complications if left unmanaged. The syndrome contributes to blood vessel damage, inflammation, and plaque buildup in arteries, heightening the risk of heart attacks and strokes.

Valley’s Lifestyle Medicine team focuses on preventing and managing metabolic syndrome through lifestyle changes. They offer personalized nutrition counseling, emphasizing whole foods to improve cholesterol, blood sugar, and blood pressure. Physical therapy addresses barriers to physical activity, ensuring safe and effective exercise. The Lifestyle365 program provides individualized exercise plans and support to help clients stay accountable and track progress.

By combining expertise in nutrition, movement, and exercise, the team aims to reduce belly fat, lower blood pressure, improve blood sugar control, and enhance heart health. With the right guidance, individuals can take control of their health and make lasting changes to thrive.
