Pozole Verde is a flavorful Mexican soup made with chicken, hominy, and salsa verde. This recipe yields 6 servings and requires the following ingredients: 3 1/2 quarts of chicken stock, a 25-ounce can of hominy, 1 1/2 cups of salsa verde, 1 pound of shredded chicken breast, 1 teaspoon of Mexican oregano, and kosher salt to taste. For garnishing, prepare a bunch of radishes, a head of romaine lettuce, 2 tablespoons of Mexican oregano, 1/4 cup of Mexican chile powder (Tajin), 5 ounces of cotija cheese, 1 cup of Mexican crema, 12 tostadas, and 3 limes.

To prepare, bring the chicken stock to a simmer in a large pot. Rinse the hominy and add it to the stock, cooking until softened but still firm. Incorporate the salsa verde, shredded chicken, and oregano, simmering for at least 30 minutes, then season with salt. While the soup simmers, prepare the garnishes: slice radishes, chiffonade the lettuce, quarter the limes, and crumble the cotija cheese. Refrigerate the garnishes until serving. Serve the pozole with the garnishes and enjoy.
