July is recognized as Disability Pride Month, a period dedicated to celebrating the history, achievements, and contributions of individuals with disabilities, while emphasizing the importance of inclusion and accessibility. This observance serves as a reminder that disability is a natural part of human diversity. More than 70 million adults in the U.S. live with a disability, and this month advocates for their acceptance and recognition.

Disability Pride Month, established annually in July, commemorates the signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) on July 26, 1990. It highlights the rich culture and history of the disability community, while challenging misconceptions that individuals with disabilities must conform to societal norms to lead meaningful lives. Celebrating this month involves connecting with people with disabilities, learning about their history and culture, and advocating for their rights.

Neighborhood House supports the disability community not just during this month, but throughout the year, providing resources like care coordination and caregiver support. The organization encourages everyone to engage with the disability community, challenge ableism, and promote a culture of respect and inclusion.
