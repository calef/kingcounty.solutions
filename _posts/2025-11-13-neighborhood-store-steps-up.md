With rising grocery costs in King County, many families struggle to find affordable food that meets their dietary needs. In response, Trader Joe’s in Burien has partnered with the Atlantic Street Center (ASC) to support families, particularly kinship caregivers, who often face financial challenges. This collaboration allowed participants to explore Trader Joe’s products, learn about healthy meal preparation, and receive guidance from store Crew Members. Many older adults in King County are raising children, with a significant portion living below the poverty line. The event created a shopping adventure for ASC families, where they discovered how to choose nutritious options and prepare meals on a budget. Participants expressed appreciation for the experience, highlighting the importance of understanding food labels and making healthy choices. The initiative emphasizes the critical need for accessible, affordable food in the community, helping families transition from merely surviving to thriving. Trader Joe’s commitment to supporting these families not only enhances food accessibility but also fosters a sense of community and resourcefulness among participants.
