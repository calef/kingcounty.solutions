Seattle IT’s Old Tech Drive, held on October 7 and 8 in partnership with PCs for People, successfully encouraged city employees to donate their unwanted electronics. This initiative not only facilitated responsible disposal but also aimed to bridge the digital divide by providing technology to those in need. Over the two days, participants donated a variety of devices, including 44 laptops, 36 tablets, 60 phones, 4 desktops, and 5 monitors. These items will be either refurbished for community use or recycled responsibly. 

The drive had a significant environmental impact, diverting 705 pounds of e-waste from landfills and preventing 825 pounds of CO₂ emissions—equivalent to the amount absorbed by newly planted trees. This initiative underscores the importance of proper e-waste disposal to prevent toxic materials from harming the environment. The success of the event reflects a growing awareness among Seattle employees regarding the necessity of sustainable practices. Plans for the next Old Tech Drive are already in the works, scheduled for early 2026, encouraging continued community engagement in digital equity and environmental stewardship.
