The Center for Active Living offers a variety of classes, including foreign languages, music, writing, and art, along with lectures and documentary films on diverse topics. These classes also provide opportunities to connect with others who share similar interests. Additional resources for lifelong learning include affordable classes through South Seattle College and Seattle Parks and Recreation, as well as the extensive Seattle Public Library system, which offers a wealth of books, audiobooks, eBooks, and DVDs at no cost.
