  <p><strong>OLYMPIA </strong>- The Department of Health has issued a notice of intent to deny the license application for Peninsula Counseling (BHA.FS.60873800) pending further legal action.</p>

Allegedly this individual is involved in financial aspects, clinical supervision, and ownership of Peninsula Counseling. Permitting a person with prior enforcement action to be involved in the day-to-day operations can result in a denial of a credential per WAC 246-341-0335(1)(d)(ix) and (2)(c) in addition to RCW 43.70.115(1).</p>

  <p>The facility has 28 days to respond to the charges. The public will continue to be updated should further actions occur in the future.</p>
