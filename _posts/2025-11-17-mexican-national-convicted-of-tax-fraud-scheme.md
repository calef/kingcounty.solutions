A federal jury in Las Vegas convicted Francisco Ivan Velazquez, a Mexican national, for operating a fraudulent scheme where he impersonated an IRS officer. Velazquez misled victims by claiming he could secure large sums of money from a fictitious IRS program intended for individuals who lost homes to foreclosure. He charged victims fees to submit applications for these nonexistent funds and, in some cases, assisted in filing false tax returns that falsely claimed substantial federal tax withholdings. Velazquez was found guilty of three counts of wire fraud, one count of aiding the presentation of a false tax return, and two counts of impersonating an IRS officer. The jury did not reach a verdict on four additional counts related to preparing false tax returns. Sentencing is scheduled for February 18, 2026, where he faces significant prison time: up to 20 years for each wire fraud count, three years for aiding in a false tax return, and additional years for impersonation counts. The case is being investigated by the IRS Criminal Investigation and the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration.
