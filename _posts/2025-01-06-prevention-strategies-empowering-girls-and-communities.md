January marks Human Trafficking Awareness Month, highlighting the urgent issue of human sex trafficking, especially among minors, with girls disproportionately affected. Olive Crest is dedicated to combating this crisis through education, empowerment, and proactive interventions aimed at high-risk youth. The organization addresses the root causes of vulnerability, focusing on prevention by empowering girls and strengthening communities to create protective environments against exploitation. Key initiatives include family preservation services that provide counseling and support, educational programs designed to equip youth and caregivers with knowledge about trafficking warning signs, and safe housing solutions like the Hope Refuge Campus for survivors and at-risk youth. Collaboration with local law enforcement, schools, healthcare providers, and faith communities is essential to amplify efforts and ensure comprehensive support for affected youth. Olive Crest invites individuals to join the fight against human trafficking by educating themselves, supporting high-risk youth, and volunteering resources to create a safer future for all children.
