Paola Fernandez, a bilingual Counselor/Case Manager in Seattle's Human Services Department, has been dedicated to supporting older adults and individuals with disabilities since joining the Aging and Disability Services division in 2024. Celebrating National Hispanic Heritage Month, she emphasizes her commitment to empowering clients, many of whom face language barriers and complex challenges such as limited mobility and social isolation. With over 14 years of experience in social work, Paola has advocated for vulnerable populations, including immigrant families and survivors of domestic violence.

Her role involves conducting home visits, assessing needs, and connecting clients to essential services, all while building trust and respect. Personal experiences, particularly her mother's paralysis, have deepened her empathy and understanding of client struggles. Paola is passionate about fostering self-advocacy among clients, helping them recognize their rights and navigate systems confidently. She believes in contributing to racial equity by ensuring every client feels seen and heard. Paola’s motivation stems from her immigrant background and the desire to inspire others to overcome challenges, reinforcing the importance of voice and empowerment in her work.
