  ## The role of genomics in guiding better health decision for Veterans

  Dr. Jason Vassy is a primary care physician at VA Boston Healthcare System. He leads the Genomes to Veterans Research Program, which focuses on bringing genomic tools to help VA use genetic information to improve Veterans’ health.

  “How can we use a Veteran’s genetic makeup to help improve their health care?” he asked, in the podcast. While not all conditions require genetic testing, “in the areas where we know doctors should be using genetic testing… how do we make it easier for them?”

  This work shows how VA is staying ahead when it comes to health and technology.

  ## Exploring the potential of DNA-guided treatment

  In Dr. Vassy’s [VA study on pharmacogenetics](https://www.va.gov/washington-dc-health-care/programs/pharmacogenomics/) for depression, he found that Veterans who received DNA-guided medication choices fared better, stating, “Patients that got that kind of testing were more likely to have a medication that was a better match for their DNA and had lower rates of depressive symptoms.” His team also used data from the [Million Veteran Program (MVP)](https://www.research.va.gov/mvp/) to identify Veterans with a genetic form of extremely high cholesterol, noting, “We reached back out… and got them connected to clinical genetic testing, increased surveillance, and treatment.” These actions helped Veterans and their families reduce their risk of early heart disease.

Dr. Vassy emphasizes the importance of genomic medicine in the future of veteran health care. The integration of genomic data into clinical practice aims to enhance personalized treatment plans, enabling tailored therapies based on individual genetic profiles. This approach can significantly improve health outcomes for veterans, particularly in managing chronic diseases and mental health conditions.

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is actively working to incorporate genomic medicine into its health care system, providing veterans with access to genetic testing and counseling. By understanding the genetic underpinnings of diseases, healthcare providers can offer more precise diagnoses and treatment options. 

Dr. Vassy highlights ongoing research and collaborations that are essential for advancing genomic medicine within the VA. This initiative not only aims to improve patient care but also seeks to reduce health disparities among veterans. As the VA embraces this innovative approach, it lays the groundwork for a health care model that prioritizes individualized care, ultimately leading to better health outcomes and enhanced quality of life for veterans.
