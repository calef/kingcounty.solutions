In the podcast "The Appetite 141: Healing Your Inner Eater," Julie Church interviews Jessica Setnick, the creator of the “Healing Your Inner Eater” workshop and workbook. Setnick emphasizes how early experiences with food shape current eating behaviors and encourages listeners to explore their "inner eater," which consists of three parts: the inner child (or rebel), the critical societal voice, and the competent adult. The inner child seeks immediate gratification, while the critical voice enforces societal norms and expectations about food. The competent adult helps navigate these conflicting impulses to make balanced decisions about eating. Setnick's approach aims to make the concepts of eating disorder treatment more accessible to everyone, not just those who identify as having an eating disorder. She advocates for a shift in nutrition education, particularly for children, focusing on basic concepts of food and health rather than complex nutritional details. The workbook offers individuals a chance to reflect on their past experiences with food and develop a healthier relationship with eating. The episode serves as a resource for anyone looking to understand and improve their relationship with food through self-exploration and personal growth.
