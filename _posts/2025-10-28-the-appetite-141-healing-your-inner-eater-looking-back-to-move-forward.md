  (<u>00:04</u>):</p>\n<p>Welcome to the Appetite, a podcast brought to you by Opal
  Food and Body Wisdom, an eating disorder treatment clinic in Seattle, Washington.
  On this podcast, we talk about all things food, body movement, and mental health.
  I&#8217;m Julie Church dietician, nutrition director and co-founder of Opal, and
  I&#8217;ll be your host for today&#8217;s show and I get to introduce you to our
  special guest, Jessica Snick, who is here. Welcome.</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>00:29</u>):</p>\n<p>Hello.
  So happy to be here.</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>00:30</u>):</p>\n<p>Yay. So I could
  do all sorts of ways of introducing Jessica. I think we&#8217;ve been fairly in
  the field for about the same-ish time, but I think Jessica did predate me some because
  I got first introduced to her by one of her first things that she did to really
  benefit the eating disorder field was that eating disorder bootcamp. And Jessica
  as a registered dietician has been somebody who has been a pioneer in a lot of professional
  education as well as the clinical interface like having her own clients and caseload
  for many years. But she is retired from that now and is really just focusing her
  attention on how she can help individuals in kind of, I think I want to hear more,
  but really a focus almost outside of the nutrition field to maybe enhance the other
  folks out there to know more about eating disorders and hopefully maybe prevent
  or assess better. Yeah. So I want to hear more</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>01:29</u>):</p>\n<p>That,
  okay, eating disorder treatment is so crucially important, but there&#8217;s just
  a big but to that, right? Which is that only a very small portion of people with
  eating difficulties ever make it to specialty care. And most people aren&#8217;t
  even diagnosed with an eating disorder and still may have difficulties with their
  eating. So my goal was to sort of take the words eating disorder out of the same
  methods that we might use to help someone with an eating disorder, but just remove
  those words so that people who would never in their wildest dreams identify with
  I have an eating disorder, could still learn some of the skills that we use to help
  people with eating disorders</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>02:12</u>):</p>\n<p>That</p>\n<p>Jessica
  Setnick (<u>02:12</u>):</p>\n<p>Really can help anyone.</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>02:14</u>):</p>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>Jessica
  Setnick (<u>02:14</u>):</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s the goal of healing your inner eater
  is just different wording, but some of the same techniques that we might use on
  a, I&#8217;ll say, I don&#8217;t know if a lighter scale is the right word, but
  more of a in-home living kind of scale where someone can do it, A DIY, let&#8217;s</p>\n<p>Julie
  Church (<u>02:30</u>):</p>\n<p>Say,</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>02:31</u>):</p>\n<p>Versus
  necessarily needing to as if they don&#8217;t even identify as someone who might
  need to meet with a dietician or a therapist. They can still do some of these things
  on their own to really look back. And then of course the last page of the workbook
  says something like, once you&#8217;ve done these things, you may want to talk with
  someone about them.</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>02:49</u>):</p>\n<p>Okay, wonderful.
  Yeah. So we are going to get to hear a lot more about this inner eating workbook
  and some of that. Can you speak to, I think the reach beyond the dieticians also,
  and you were also speaking some on your website about just health educators, school
  counselors, maybe first responders, primary care, athletic staff, college health.
  What are you doing in that world to bring your knowledge?</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick
  (<u>03:17</u>):</p>\n<p>So people tend to think that educating kids about nutrition
  means educating kids about nutrition. It&#8217;s not right. It&#8217;s like we think
  of nutrition from an adult point of view, nutrients, macronutrients, micronutrients,
  carbs, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, even supplements. We think of all this
  adult conception of language, healthy foods, not healthy foods. Sometimes foods,
  moderation, fun foods, all these things might mean something to us, but to kids
  it&#8217;s totally different. Nutrition education isn&#8217;t actually talking about
  nutrition, it&#8217;s talking about the very, very, very basics. Why do you need
  food? Food makes your body grow, food makes you have energy, food makes you feel
  good. That&#8217;s the kind of stuff that we have to talk to kids about. Role modeling,
  appropriate eating, role modeling, not judging other people&#8217;s foods. So in
  other words, my stance is trying to say that not talking about nutrition facts and
  details is not the lack of education about nutrition.</p>\n<p>(<u>04:28</u>):</p>\n<p>Those
  things, kids are so concrete. The example I always give is red and green. We teach
  kids, you go on green stop on red, that&#8217;s it, right? Because kids don&#8217;t
  have discernment. As adults, we know sometimes you stop on green and sometimes you
  go on red, right? But you can&#8217;t teach kids that because they don&#8217;t have
  that discernment. So when you tell kids something like, oh, I&#8217;ll just make
  something up, pizza is bad for you. Then in a child&#8217;s mind they take away,
  if I see my mom eating pizza, something bad might happen to her, right? It&#8217;s
  very concrete. They don&#8217;t have the discernment to say either that was your
  point of view or eating pizza all the time might not be the healthiest choice. They
  just don&#8217;t have that discernment. So in other words, we need to stop giving
  kids discerning nuanced nutrition information that we understand and start putting
  it into very kid appropriate concrete thinking.</p>\n<p>(<u>05:30</u>):</p>\n<p>And
  we don&#8217;t want kids to think concretely about food in goods or bads, so therefore
  we have to stop talking to them about it in terms of goods and bads. I love that.
  Instead talk about colors in foods and wait a minute, you ran so fast you must have
  eaten something this morning. You had tons of energy and really simple kind of connections.
  So the same way we talk to kids about their bodies and feeling good about their
  bodies, we&#8217;re really not getting into the minutia that&#8217;s in our heads.
  But somehow we think if we, that if we deliver that to kids younger, we&#8217;re
  going to prevent eating problems. And it&#8217;s actually the reverse.</p>\n<p>Julie
  Church (<u>06:08</u>):</p>\n<p>So you&#8217;re as a dietician trying to get to the
  school counselor or the athletic trainer or the coach and helping them broaden their
  perspective on what nutrition education is and</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>06:19</u>):</p>\n<p>Ideally
  all of them, because the more people in an environment, whether it&#8217;s a college
  or whether it&#8217;s an elementary school or whether it&#8217;s a hospital, the
  more people that have that information, the more consistent message is coming through.
  So this summer I&#8217;m speaking to the National Association of Health Unit coordinators,
  which I guess is what we used to call sort of a unit secretary. It has a different
  name now it&#8217;s a unit coordinator. So that&#8217;s someone who doesn&#8217;t
  necessarily have a health professional type of education, but they&#8217;re interacting
  with patients all the time. And so it&#8217;s wonderful that people who aren&#8217;t
  even necessarily involved in that kind of direct patient care but are in a hospital
  setting want to learn about eating disorders. And so I&#8217;m doing healing your
  inner eater with them. So that&#8217;s the idea is that all of us really need to
  change if we want to prevent eating disorders, and we cannot prevent all of them,
  but we all could benefit from changing the way we talk about food and eating to
  our kids and also ourself because we have an inner eater, which is pretty childlike
  a lot of the time.</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>07:23</u>):</p>\n<p>Okay. Yeah. So what
  you&#8217;re saying too, yeah, you&#8217;re trying to address, well, yeah, there&#8217;s
  this mainstream messaging that diet culture gives us about nutrition and you&#8217;re
  trying to get in there to help some of the educators and the influencers that are
  with others to have awareness around that and maybe give some different messages.
  So I love that. So this is sort of a deeper dive into even intro of you, but is
  there, I think the other bigger, I guess organization, I think of you being a part
  of that you founded was ied, which is the International Federation</p>\n<p>Jessica
  Setnick (<u>07:55</u>):</p>\n<p>Of Eating Eating Disorder, dieticians,</p>\n<p>Julie
  Church (<u>07:56</u>):</p>\n<p>Right? Of eating disorder dieticians. Is that still
  up and running? Is that still an organization? Oh my gosh,</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick
  (<u>08:00</u>):</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>(<u>08:01</u>):</p>\n<p>So IED has just been
  something that grew bigger than maybe my wildest dreams because I am not equipped
  to be running a nonprofit organization of 900 members. But it&#8217;s also been
  wonderful because it gives dieticians who work in the eating disorder field of voice
  and dieticians who didn&#8217;t know they were going to be working in the eating
  disorder field, a community. So a lot of the people that join our more sort of eating
  disorder interested, I would say, and I think of IED as my Girl Scout best. I don&#8217;t
  know if anyone listening has ever been a Girl Scout or had a Girl Scout, but my
  step baby, Peyton, who&#8217;s grown up now, when she was six or seven, I used to
  walk the neighborhood with her selling Girl Scout cookies. I know they do it differently
  now, but at that time you would just walk up to a stranger&#8217;s door and knock
  on their door and offer to sell them cookies.</p>\n<p>(<u>08:48</u>):</p>\n<p>Well,
  this is a child who couldn&#8217;t order for herself in a restaurant. She&#8217;d
  whisper to me what she wanted and then I would tell the server, and yet when she
  put on that Girl scout vest, she would march right up to a stranger&#8217;s door
  and knock on that door and sell that person, girl Scout cookies. And so I think
  of IED as my Girl scout vest, for example. I&#8217;m talking to government officials.
  I wrote a letter to the secretary of the va. I don&#8217;t do those things, but
  IED gives me the Girl Scout vest, right? And I just march right up to the secretary
  of the va. I mean, I&#8217;m writing a letter to the Honorable Bull, Doug Collins,
  a cabinet member and saying, this is what&#8217;s important to the eating disorder,
  dieticians and the veterans they serve. And so I feel like that&#8217;s what IED
  is really doing behind the scenes. A lot of people think of IED as just sort of
  a membership organization, but we&#8217;re doing a ton of advocacy work. The goal
  all along has been to help people get access to care. And I feel like in the past
  two years we&#8217;ve really made advances and leaps and bounds toward that.</p>\n<p>Julie
  Church (<u>09:49</u>):</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s awesome. Wonderful to hear about that.
  I think I didn&#8217;t even know maybe that that was it, but I did notice when,
  I can&#8217;t remember exactly the troubling news or stance that was brought out
  by some national organization if Fed did jump in and wrote an article or got some
  of us all to sign off on something. So I guess I have seen you do that. So thank
  you for that and behalf of many of us dieticians, and I would love, I think as listeners
  already can tell Jessica&#8217;s passionate and energetic. So I am excited that
  our paths recross to say, yes, of course you should be on the appetite. And today
  we are going to focus on something she&#8217;s already been referencing in terms
  of talking about healing your inner eater and that workbook and workshop that she
  has been creating and doing more in her current state. So healing your inner eater.
  Jessica, can you tell us what is this and how did it start and what is this is a
  workbook, is it workshop? Is it something anybody can do? Is it dietician focused?
  I don&#8217;t tell me.</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>10:53</u>):</p>\n<p>So healing
  your inner eater started as a five day workshop at sort of a high end, let&#8217;s
  call it a rehab center. And it costs thousands of dollars to go, which I did not
  get, but it was a five day workshop for people who had already been through treatment
  for traumatic events and really wanted to look at how those events might be affecting
  their eating. And so I came up with a curriculum for it, and what was amazing to
  me, again, I didn&#8217;t want it to have the word eating disorders in it, so it
  was called Making Food Your Friend again, which is sort of a troubling concept in
  some ways. And so I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;ve changed the name, but that&#8217;s what
  it was called at the time. And the people who came were amazing, I would say potentially
  could have all been diagnosed with eating disorders, but also had amazing stories
  to tell.</p>\n<p>(<u>11:44</u>):</p>\n<p>And in this confidential environment, we
  made timelines of your life experiences with food. And just to give you an example,
  one of the individuals, and none of this will be identifying information recalled
  as a child, his first eating experience was that he remembered being on the ground
  on all fours, eating grass. And of course we had to hear how did that come about?
  He was something like, and I won&#8217;t have the exact numbers, but let&#8217;s
  say he was the 10th of 10 children and his mother unfortunately died during the
  childbirth process. So there was only one girl in this family and she was 12 or
  13 years old. And so for whatever reason, the girl was given this baby, a girl&#8217;s
  going to know how to take care of a baby. Well, she certainly didn&#8217;t know
  how to take care of the baby. And so he remembers being on the ground on the farm
  with the sheep eating grass because he did not even know he was a human baby and
  remembers throwing up. And so you&#8217;re talking about starting out life with
  some very traumatic experiences related to food. And what I found, of course, we
  handled that and discussed it person to person in the group. But from a bigger picture
  point of view, what alerted me and alarmed me is we&#8217;re talking about people
  who have already been in treatment for traumatic events in their life and the unhealthy
  behaviors that arose from them, like drinking or drug use. And no one had ever talked
  with this man about this.</p>\n<p>(<u>13:18</u>):</p>\n<p>This is the first time
  he had shared this with anyone. And so that&#8217;s what alerted me that so much
  is going on and going into people&#8217;s eating that no one is thinking to ask
  about and talk about. And so over time, obviously a five day workshop that costs
  thousands of dollars is not very accessible. And so I shrunk the whole thing into
  a workbook, change the name to healing your inner eater, and now it&#8217;s something
  that people can, yes, there are people who come to a workshop when their workplace
  hires me and what they&#8217;re hiring me to do in theory is two things, or in reality
  is two things. One is to teach them some of these skills to help the people that
  they serve, but to do that we&#8217;re also delivering the content to the people
  who are attending to look within on their own.</p>\n<p>(<u>14:05</u>):</p>\n<p>And
  so that&#8217;s how healing your inner eater became what it is. I wanted it to be
  something accessible where people can say, something&#8217;s going on with my eating.
  I may not be able to put my finger on it. It may not rise to the level of what I
  think I need to see a professional about, but here&#8217;s some ideas of what you
  could start to look at on your own as a friend with your dietician and start to
  see how those early childhood experiences, and not only that, but the people who
  raised us, what are the messages that we&#8217;re still carrying? And I know I&#8217;ve
  thrown a lot of words at you, but I&#8217;ll sort of close my mouth after I say
  that. When things happen to us when we&#8217;re kids, it&#8217;s so tempting as
  adults for people, I&#8217;ve heard it a million times, well, that&#8217;s an exaggeration.</p>\n<p>(<u>14:49</u>):</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve
  heard it a lot of times where say, well, that happened so long ago, it&#8217;s not
  affecting me anymore. And I think the opposite, the younger you were when it happened,
  the fewer resources and discernment you had to understand it. The longer you&#8217;ve
  been living that storyline, whatever it was that you learned, and the more of your
  life that has been affected by it. And so that is why we really look back to move
  forward because these early experiences are not sometimes things that are really
  discussed or thought about, we think it&#8217;s so far in our path.</p>\n<p>Julie
  Church (<u>15:22</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s wonderful. I think that is so
  true, and just to have our listeners hear that and go, okay, yeah, it is okay to
  be pondering or even exploring those things in our past to then hopefully move forward
  in a healthier, more life-giving relationship with food. When we started the appetite,
  it was really to target the same thing you&#8217;re saying, which is that there&#8217;s
  so many people that will never do treatment at Opal, and we wanted there to be something
  that somebody could tap into, listen to get some resources from and do their own
  healing in the ways that could be accessible. So in the same way your workbook and
  other ways even talking about this on this podcast, we&#8217;ll be doing that at
  the same time with appetite, which I love that. Why</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>16:05</u>):</p>\n<p>Am
  I not surprised?</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>16:08</u>):</p>\n<p>Well, I would love
  for you to then, I think you&#8217;re kind of already defined, but your term of
  inner eater, can you just give me a little bit more of an expansive definition of
  what you mean by that?</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>16:20</u>):</p>\n<p>Yes. There
  are three parts to your inner eater. All of us, we all have an inner eater. There
  is the inner child, which I&#8217;m going to call the inner rebel, which is the
  one that wants what it wants when it wants it, right in the middle of the night.
  I want three nutty bars from little Debbie in my pantry and I want to eat them.
  Then there is the critical society, the internalized voice of critical society or
  diet culture that says, that is ridiculous. That is an insane amount of calories.
  You shouldn&#8217;t be eating in the middle of the night. You should be asleep and
  X, Y, Z will happen if you eat those things. And then the third part of your inner
  eater, which for many of us is a very, very tiny little voice, very quiet, is the
  competent adult or the competent eater.</p>\n<p>(<u>17:10</u>):</p>\n<p>And the
  competent eater is the one that sort of navigates between those other two parts
  and says, thank you inner Re for being excited about little Debbie snack cakes and
  thank you critical society who&#8217;s trying to keep me safe, but I&#8217;m going
  to make a competent decision about this right now. And that decision might be I
  woke up in the middle of the night because I&#8217;m hungry, so I&#8217;m going
  to have a nutty bar. And it might be I woke up in the middle of the night hungry,
  so I&#8217;m going to have a Turkey sandwich. In other words, the competent adult
  takes the information from the other two and figures out what is the best course
  of action. It doesn&#8217;t just knee jerk react between one and two. But one of
  the things that you sent me as far as questions you thought you might ask, I hope
  I ask it myself. I hope it&#8217;s okay. What is the impact of when your competent
  adult isn&#8217;t? Well, it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s that you&#8217;re bouncing
  back and forth between that inner rebel and that critical society voice without
  a lot of input from the competent adult. And that&#8217;s when you see overeating
  undereating and a lot of regret and guilt about</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>18:15</u>):</p>\n<p>Both.
  That&#8217;s such an impact.</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>18:18</u>):</p>\n<p>And
  never feeling like you&#8217;re doing it right or eating, and I&#8217;m using finger
  quotes for the people who can&#8217;t see my hands right now.</p>\n<p>Julie Church
  (<u>18:26</u>):</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t see your hands, but yes, that is good to say.
  That is good to say. So then, if one is wanting to do that journey of inner eater
  and build becoming a competent eater and have awareness around the rebel awareness
  of the critical society, diet culture, what are some of the ways to do that? Or
  what&#8217;s the journey?</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>18:48</u>):</p>\n<p>So the
  goal, and sometimes we have to build up to a goal, but the ultimate goal is to be
  able to hear the competent eater voice either as loudly as the other two or almost
  sometimes in place of the other two, that it&#8217;s instead of having angel and
  devil on your shoulders and feeling like you have to have this other voice come
  in and navigate between them or negotiate between them, the competent eater voice
  becomes more of our inner north star, our compass. Of course, in times of stress,
  the inner rebel and the critical society may become louder, but the goal is to really
  give that competent eater a voice, that competent adult voice. And the way to do
  that at first is to start listening for all three voices. So for example, when someone
  is feeling conflicted about what to do next to think, okay, what&#8217;s my inner
  rebel saying?</p>\n<p>(<u>19:44</u>):</p>\n<p>What&#8217;s my inner critical society
  voice saying? And then what are the other options? And the best way to spot when
  you are battling between inner rebel and critical society is if you can only see
  two options. So let&#8217;s say you and I, Julie are sitting at lunch and in your
  mind you&#8217;re battling back and forth, I could eat a dry salad or I could have
  a cheeseburger, fries and a milkshake, and the menu might have, oh my gosh, let&#8217;s
  say we&#8217;re at the Cheesecake Factory. There&#8217;s like 40,000 things on that
  menu, but all you can see is there&#8217;s a right choice and a wrong choice. That&#8217;s
  what tells you that you are in black and white thinking. You are just battling between
  these two voices. And so you have to sort of identify that. And you might say, Jessica,
  all I can see right now is I could have a dry salad and be good, or I could have
  a cheeseburger milkshake and fries and be satisfied.</p>\n<p>(<u>20:36</u>):</p>\n<p>Can
  you help? And I might say, well, I think you could have both of those things or
  either of those things, but tell me you&#8217;re thinking about it. What else? What
  are the options? How would you guide me if I said those things? And so it&#8217;s
  sort of a conversation you can, I&#8217;m just depicting it as a conversation with
  another person, but it can even be a conversation with yourself. Because the truth
  is you could have a salad and a milkshake. You could have a cheeseburger and a fruit
  plate when you could only see two options. That means your competent adult is hiding
  over in a corner. And so we got to bring the competent adult out and say things
  like, what sounds good to me? How hungry am I? What will be my next eating opportunity?
  How much money is in my pocket? Et cetera, et cetera. And the competent adult uses
  all kinds of determining factors on why to make choices about food. Whereas the
  inner rebel and critical society only use this false dichotomy of what&#8217;s good
  for me and what&#8217;s bad for</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>21:36</u>):</p>\n<p>Me.
  That&#8217;s awesome. Yeah, I love that. Just it&#8217;s the awareness, increasing
  of awareness and allowing for the conversations that happen in our own mind and
  heart about food to matter. It&#8217;s like just make that matter.</p>\n<p>Jessica
  Setnick (<u>21:51</u>):</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s a mic drop moment. Yes. The conversations
  that happen in our food and mind make them matter. I love that.</p>\n<p>Julie Church
  (<u>21:58</u>):</p>\n<p>Yes. Yeah, because I think so many times, especially when
  somebody&#8217;s maybe on a diet or struggling with eating disorder, it&#8217;s
  like this thing, I just got to push it away. I got to just push it away. I got to
  push it away. But I do think, no, this slows everybody down maybe to say, Hey, to
  have my own awareness about this and listen actually could help me in this moment
  and then allow for me to make the decision I want to with my food.</p>\n<p>Jessica
  Setnick (<u>22:23</u>):</p>\n<p>And because that&#8217;s the goal. And I said, sometimes
  we have to take steps to get toward the goal. Sometimes it can go either way. Either
  we can hear those inner voices and think, oh my gosh, where did I get this idea
  that these are my only options and trace it back? Or sometimes you have to go the
  other way and look at the formative years of your life to be able to hear those
  specific voices. And that&#8217;s where a timeline comes in. And looking at the
  people who raised you. Yeah,</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>22:52</u>):</p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s
  one of the things about the workbook, I was excited to get into this and hear how
  you&#8217;re navigating this, but the workbook description does talk about the importance
  of looking back to move forward. And part of that is exploring one&#8217;s caregivers
  and their own experiences with their food relationship and perhaps maybe the feeding
  relationship between that caregiver and yourself. So tell me more how you do that
  and</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>23:15</u>):</p>\n<p>Sure. So I am going to use the
  term eating legacy to describe everything that came before us that we inherited.
  And so we are the product of the people who survive. So in other words, we are the
  product of our caregivers. They are the product of their caregivers. And I always
  say caregivers because not everyone was raised by a family member or by a parent
  or parent. So anyone that impacted you. And in the workbook there&#8217;s a circle
  for you. And then there are many circles around because we were impacted by many
  people other than our primary caregivers. So the idea is to identify the people
  that were involved in your early childhood life and ideally, hopefully those people
  all had your best interests at heart, even if it didn&#8217;t seem like it, there
  may be some people in there who didn&#8217;t, and that can be traumatic on its own.</p>\n<p>(<u>24:08</u>):</p>\n<p>But
  one of the key things that we try to talk about in the workshop is just because
  the people who were raising you were trying their best. We don&#8217;t have to blame
  them for causing problems. That doesn&#8217;t mean that they saw you for who you
  were and exactly what you needed. So we have to look at not just the people who
  raised us, but what was their eating experience when they were kids and the people
  who raised them. And so we have to keep going back because the truth is we are a
  product of people who lived thousands of years ago. And I love to say that people
  pleasing is a survival skill. We learned a long time ago in our genes that if you
  don&#8217;t stay with the group, then you can&#8217;t survive. And so we are descended
  from the people who were able to conform to survive in the short term that plays
  out as if I play peekaboo with these weirdos, then they will feed me and change
  my diaper when I need it. And so we learned to go along to get along. Another example
  is let&#8217;s say thousands of years ago, who&#8217;s going to survive when there&#8217;s
  not enough food? The person who says, oh, well I guess there&#8217;s not enough
  food. Or the person who gets hangry and says, out of my way people, I got to go
  find some food.</p>\n<p>(<u>25:23</u>):</p>\n<p>So we are descended from the people
  that got hangry when they didn&#8217;t get enough to eat. So these are the kind
  of things that we have to recognize that we think our individual eating behavior
  is our conscious choice and we make our own destiny. And the message of diet culture
  definitely tells us if something&#8217;s going wrong with your eating, just change
  your mind. Do it differently when really we are reacting to generations and generations
  of eating experiences. Some of them far back, but also some of them very recent.
  And I&#8217;m thinking of the stories that people tell at the workshop, and some
  of them will make you cry. I mean, I&#8217;m thinking of someone who said that her
  grandmother always cried at big family meals, and she would ask Grandpa, why is
  grandma sad? And he would say, no, grandma&#8217;s crying because she&#8217;s happy.
  And she didn&#8217;t understand until she was an adult that her grandma grew up
  in a dust bowl situation either in Kansas or Oklahoma, somewhere during the depression
  where there wasn&#8217;t enough food.</p>\n<p>(<u>26:23</u>):</p>\n<p>And apparently
  the minister would come over to her family&#8217;s house every Sunday after church,
  and the children were not allowed to eat until the grownups were done, that the
  parents didn&#8217;t want to tell the minister that they were struggling. So they&#8217;d
  put out as much of a spread as they could, and the kids would basically watch the
  minister eating seconds and thirds knowing that that meant they weren&#8217;t going
  to have anything to eat. And so for this grandma now to be an adult and to see her
  whole family with grandkids and everyone sitting around the table with enough to
  eat really moved her to tears every single time. And so that&#8217;s just an example
  of the way that our patterns are transmitted through generations. And if we don&#8217;t
  have an explanation, which a lot of times we don&#8217;t have the luxury of an explanation,
  we have made up our own story about those things and it may be affecting our eating
  still till now.</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>27:13</u>):</p>\n<p>How do you guide folks
  if they don&#8217;t know that story? Are there ways that you help them put some
  of the pieces together?</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>27:22</u>):</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s
  an interesting question, and I am not sure I&#8217;ve ever thought of it quite that
  way, but I am good at reading between the lines, and probably you are too. And we&#8217;ve
  both seen a lot of individuals and heard a lot of their eating stories. And so to
  be able to give someone ideas, possibilities. So some of the possibilities include
  the fact that none of us, I may not know your heritage, but there is no one alive
  today who isn&#8217;t somewhere descended in the past few generations from someone
  who went through a refugee situation, a food insecurity situation, the Great Depression,
  the Holocaust. There&#8217;s all kinds of different ways that people have been traumatized
  with regard to food. And so even if you don&#8217;t know exactly what your caregivers
  went through, that there was some of that in there somewhere. That&#8217;s why we
  all, not we, but many of us have grown up with, you have to eat everything on your
  plate.</p>\n<p>(<u>28:16</u>):</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s children starving in blank.
  And so there are themes that we can predict probably happened to someone based on
  their eating behavior. Someone who, for example, hides food. We can say, do you
  think that there was a situation in your past where someone didn&#8217;t have enough
  to eat and so you learned to store food somewhere or someone who had an unsafe situation
  where food was stolen from them, and so they learned to hide food in a certain way.
  We can sort of conjecture, even if we don&#8217;t know for sure, we can look at
  the outcome behaviors and suggest possibilities of how that might have transpired.
  And sometimes we kind of sound like mind readers when we say something like that.
  And then a patient once told me that he was adopted and his adopted parents, so
  it became his parents. His parents had a biological son almost the same age, and
  that son had a totally different body type. And so the biological son was allowed
  to eat whatever he wanted, and the adopted son being larger was only allowed to
  have one portion. And this developed into an adult situation where he can eat whatever
  he wants and his inner child is still telling him to binge eat</p>\n<p>(<u>29:27</u>):</p>\n<p>Because
  now he can have whatever he wants. So he&#8217;s rebelling against those childhood
  experiences. So we&#8217;ve heard enough of those stories that we can sometimes
  kind of say, I wonder if there was ever a time blah, blah, blah. And then someone&#8217;s
  like, oh my gosh, how did you know? And it&#8217;s because we can sort of read the
  tea leaves of their current eating behaviors and imagine what their past eating
  trauma might have been.</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>29:49</u>):</p>\n<p>Totally. I
  love all that. Yes, there is so much richness in that and hope the listeners are
  encouraged to kind of think back and explore that. I also am aware of some research
  that talks about the importance and the value of exploring one&#8217;s ethnic identity
  and having a connection to their roots. And I think about identity when we think
  about culture and religion and ethnicity is food. There&#8217;s so much around food
  that comes out, and I&#8217;m so aware that the influence of racism and there still
  is systemic oppression that keeps some from feeling like they can fully eat the
  foods that are connected to their family, connected to their heritage, their religion
  and culture, and do that in a public place or do that in the ways that they may
  want to. I do wonder, when you talk about that healing, there&#8217;s this awareness
  of like, okay, this is my lineage. What did you say? My eating legacy? Yeah. So
  what do I know about that? And then now in my current context, how do I then proceed
  to do this in a safe way, in a way that I feel like I can be what honored, respected?</p>\n<p>(<u>31:03</u>):</p>\n<p>What
  about that?</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>31:04</u>):</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s two parts
  of that. One is that just because your eating legacy, the heritage of your ancestors
  may have been erased by more recent generations who were trying to go along to get
  along and trying to fit into the culture because that&#8217;s what meant safety
  and survival. That is okay for you to bring back some of those things, even if let&#8217;s
  say your grandma didn&#8217;t make those things, there is someone out there that
  knows how to make those things and you can experiment with &#8217;em and you may
  not even eating all of them, but that&#8217;s what you can. And that&#8217;s the
  beauty of the internet and social media and some of the things that bring so much
  crap into our lives also sometimes brings some beauty into our lives because we
  can find people who have preserved some of those food ways and be able to bring
  those back into our lineage and our legacy for the future, even if they weren&#8217;t
  directly transmitted to us.</p>\n<p>(<u>31:58</u>):</p>\n<p>And I hear you on all
  of that social justice aspect and the systemic determinants of health, social determinants
  of health, and there&#8217;s so many buzzwords around it, but the idea basically
  being that certain parts of our heritage were erased because they were considered
  not okay. And unfortunately, I think there&#8217;s some heritage of dietician work
  doing that too. I mean if you look at any of the pictures of the dietician conferences
  of the early 19th, or sorry, early 20th century, you look at all of these stern
  looking crabby white women, there were black dieticians and there were people working
  in other areas, but they weren&#8217;t given a voice. And so the voice of dieticians
  tends to be sort of one of erasure unfortunately. And so it&#8217;s important that
  all of us bring interesting food ways and sort of heritage, legacy food ways into
  our lives and for our kids, even if they weren&#8217;t our heritage.</p>\n<p>(<u>32:53</u>):</p>\n<p>And
  that&#8217;s a beautiful thing too, but all the factors that are in our society,
  all of our ancestors had the factors in their societies. And so that&#8217;s why
  it&#8217;s so hard to be the change maker because you&#8217;re the person working
  to change generations of behaviors and generations of society. So I almost think
  of it as, and let&#8217;s just call it a slow moving train because I don&#8217;t
  love the idea of someone trying to push a train back, but I do, I think of it as
  a train of many cars and you&#8217;re trying to push it back so that it doesn&#8217;t
  keep going to your children, and it&#8217;s a huge job for the person who&#8217;s
  in the middle, not just because of let&#8217;s say, finding these legacy food ways
  that have sort of been erased, not just because of trying to undo things that you
  were taught and trying to change our thinking, which are very hard things, but also
  because some of those people are still alive and they may get hurt feelings.</p>\n<p>Julie
  Church (<u>33:48</u>):</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>33:49</u>):</p>\n<p>When
  you say, in our family we do X, Y, z, and your parents or your grandparents are
  looking at you or shaking their head or giving you the look or I can&#8217;t believe
  you let your kids eat like that. It can be very hard on the change maker because
  you&#8217;re trying to convey, I don&#8217;t judge what you did, but we are doing
  things differently in our family and for some reason we are better at doing that
  in other areas. Let&#8217;s just say you got sent to summer camp every summer and
  you&#8217;ve decided that you want your kid to have a free range summer and just
  play in the backyard. It&#8217;s somehow easier to say that than to say, you know
  what? I really don&#8217;t like gefilte fish, so we&#8217;re not going to have gefilte
  fish at Rosh Hashanah or something like that. And being Jewish, I can really equate
  this food is heritage type of idea.</p>\n<p>(<u>34:40</u>):</p>\n<p>It becomes really
  hard, and I was trying to explain it. I was asked to speak about it to a group of
  people who are not Jewish, and I was trying to explain that when someone with an
  eating disorder, and it could include people with food preferences, but this was
  specifically eating disorder professionals. When someone with an eating disorder,
  let&#8217;s just say I don&#8217;t want to eat lakas at Hanukkah, those don&#8217;t
  feel like they&#8217;re supportive to my recovery maybe another year, but this year
  is not that year that sometimes people, family members can hear like You&#8217;re
  rejecting Judaism. Our great grandparents went through the Holocaust and they came
  to America with one pair of shoes and a nickel. And it&#8217;s like, oh my gosh,
  all you said was, I don&#8217;t really like a filter fish or I don&#8217;t feel
  safe around. And someone heard that as you&#8217;re rejecting your entire culture.
  So that can be a really fraught area and we have to be able to navigate it and somehow
  it feels so much harder when you&#8217;re talking about food and eating because
  it&#8217;s so ingrained in culture than it does when you&#8217;re talking about
  something much more simple. Yeah, I know you like rose&#8217;s mom, but I really
  like daisies. Somehow food and eating is just so much</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>35:54</u>):</p>\n<p>More.
  Totally. Which is what makes it so amazing. I mean, it is so much more, and we can
  take the time and have those,</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>36:03</u>):</p>\n<p>It
  also explains why it&#8217;s hard.</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>36:04</u>):</p>\n<p>It
  does. It does. And I think what you&#8217;re saying too is those conversations might
  just need some tending to and some care and be mindful that, okay, I don&#8217;t
  want to just drop this and move on, but maybe bring it with some care if you are
  going to be asking other older family members to maybe do something different or
  you&#8217;re just sharing your experience of what&#8217;s going to work for you
  in this season to just,</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>36:28</u>):</p>\n<p>Or the love
  of all humanity, do not have these conversations at a time</p>\n<p>Julie Church
  (<u>36:33</u>):</p>\n<p>Meal. That&#8217;s totally, it&#8217;s easier if food&#8217;s
  not around and we&#8217;re not talking about it in real time, but we&#8217;re more
  allowing for somebody to take in. Oh, okay. So this summer party is going to be
  different than last year. Okay, I got it. I got it. Yeah, so true. So true. Okay,
  so what else? I guess we&#8217;re talking about maybe specific, and I feel like
  you&#8217;re tapping into this, but I do think that some parents, especially if
  you&#8217;re bringing anything that&#8217;s related to eating disorder, so if somebody
  says, wow, how you, I&#8217;m learning about my child and rebel. I&#8217;m learning
  about my critical society voice and I&#8217;m hearing some things that happened
  in our household and that stuff I&#8217;m needing to filter through and that can
  make a caregiver maybe be defensive or feel really guilty. And so any, I guess for
  both people listening, right, like the caregivers listening as well as maybe the
  folks that are wanting to talk to their caregivers either direction, but how do
  you deal with that potential shame blame piece</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>37:39</u>):</p>\n<p>With
  that? Yes. Well, in the same way that we would tell an individual, you are a product
  of your society, your time that you are alive and the people who lived before you,
  I would say the same thing to a caregiver, you are a product of your society, and
  so let&#8217;s just take it off of food for a minute. You thought that the best
  thing was to send your child to summer camp. They decided to not do that, right?
  That doesn&#8217;t mean your choice was wrong and it may have affected your child
  in a certain way, but they&#8217;re trying to do things differently in their family
  and it doesn&#8217;t mean that you were wrong. That&#8217;s such a hard thing because
  I think even in jobs, it feels like if we do it a different way, we&#8217;re somehow
  saying the other way was wrong, instead of just adapting and saying, this is a different
  time, this is a different child, this is a different family, and I think we have
  to really make room for that feeling of, but I feel like I disappointed you. I didn&#8217;t
  that asking you to eat all your peas was going to make you feel guilty. I didn&#8217;t
  realize that. I thought that&#8217;s what we were supposed to do.</p>\n<p>(<u>38:44</u>):</p>\n<p>And
  to say, absolutely, I understand that I&#8217;m not blaming you. I&#8217;m simply
  saying let&#8217;s change our eating legacy together for the next generation. So
  really bringing that caregiver into the new plan instead of saying, I&#8217;m not
  doing it your way, so you therefore can&#8217;t be involved. And to even say something
  like, I know it&#8217;s going to be a big shift, and so if I hear you saying to
  my child, you need to finish that, I&#8217;m just going to say, oh, you know what?
  Everyone in our home just eats what they&#8217;re hungry for. I love you mom, and
  I&#8217;m going to give you a hug. In other words, wrap the message in kindness
  so that we can attend to those feelings of those ancestors almost as if you, the
  same as you would if you were able to communicate with someone from 300 years ago
  and you would say, wow, you went through some tough stuff, but I don&#8217;t want
  to live without air conditioning just because you did. It&#8217;s that kind of thing.
  Just because somebody had a different food experience doesn&#8217;t mean you have
  to continue living the legacy of it. It&#8217;s not insulting to them, but it&#8217;s
  harder when it&#8217;s a living person because that person has feelings and it&#8217;s
  appropriate to attend to those and maybe have a counselor in the room if need be
  when that happens, if you&#8217;re concerned.</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>40:04</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah,
  I was thinking that of course, because at Opal it&#8217;s a treatment setting where
  we have family relationship therapists and this is some of the content that certainly
  happens in that formal way. And I do think, yeah, if somebody is really wrestling
  and struggling in the midst of an eating disorder, having professional help to have
  some of these conversations is so normal, and that is such something we recommend
  could be a therapist, could be a dietician that could help facilitate some of that
  and the others that are out there that are wanting to have those conversations.
  I think it is also something that can be done, like you said, maybe in the backyard
  in the afternoon or being brought, oh, I want to talk through the fact that, yeah,
  I&#8217;m going to have you watch the kids a few days this summer, and I&#8217;m
  really trying to reset this for myself and the family.</p>\n<p>(<u>40:51</u>):</p>\n<p>I
  would love for you to do it this way too. I know when I was raising my kids and
  had nannies, I had some stuff related to food relationship in the contract that
  I had with them just to have it written, because for me, it felt important to be
  able to have language, common language and have them see how serious and important
  it was to me. So maybe I&#8217;m more formal in that way, but I think in the family
  relationships when you&#8217;re not writing a contract for the aunt to come over
  once a month, it might be different, but I do feel like it&#8217;s still very much
  just having things in</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>41:24</u>):</p>\n<p>Writing is
  not a bad idea. I might recommend a different form, like a book. I read this book
  and it gave me some great ideas. I wonder if you&#8217;d be willing to read this
  book. We had a book like that in my family that I think five copies were bought
  and everyone got their own copy, and it was sort of read this and let&#8217;s discuss
  if we want to move forward with these ideas.</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>41:42</u>):</p>\n<p>So
  cool. I love that. Okay, so this workbook is obviously something we can have access
  to from your website. You also seem to be somebody that would do it for your workplace
  or do it at your place of worship or do it in your community mom&#8217;s group or
  whatever. People could bring you in to do something it sounds like, which is so
  cool.</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>42:03</u>):</p>\n<p>Exactly.</p>\n<p>Julie Church
  (<u>42:04</u>):</p>\n<p>Is there anything else you&#8217;d want our listeners to
  know about the healing of your inner eater and what you&#8217;re offering?</p>\n<p>Jessica
  Setnick (<u>42:12</u>):</p>\n<p>Well, I think it&#8217;s a big job. I will say healing
  your inner eater is the workshop and workbook is a start. You can go to healing
  your inner eater.com and I&#8217;ll make a code podcast. If someone wants to use
  the code podcast, it&#8217;ll bring the price down of the workbook, and then I&#8217;m
  thinking about having maybe an online group. I&#8217;m not exactly sure what form
  that will take, but I&#8217;ll keep you</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>42:33</u>):</p>\n<p>Posted.
  Okay, wonderful. So Jessica, when I think about bringing these concepts into formally
  into somebody&#8217;s recovery from an eating disorder, how would you say that that
  could be done, or what are some of your recommendations there?</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick
  (<u>42:47</u>):</p>\n<p>Well, it sounds like you&#8217;re already doing a lot of
  this at Opal, which is amazing. And as I said before, I feel like some of this is
  actually, we&#8217;re taking it from eating disorder recovery and pulling it out
  to the community, but I think it is important for anyone who is in a situation where
  they are helping individuals with eating disorders to really be thinking along the
  lines of, this didn&#8217;t start with this person. Yes, they may have had these
  genes. Yes, they may have had this incident that sparked their eating disorder,
  but we need to take it off of the idea of this is this person&#8217;s individual
  responsibility because that&#8217;s what always feels so blaming. And instead add
  in the idea of those social determinants of health, of family influences, caregiver
  influences beyond the family, and then ancestral influences and things that were
  done to harm members of our ancestor community. I think that those are important
  things to bring into eating disorder treatment if it&#8217;s not already there.
  Okay,</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>43:46</u>):</p>\n<p>Wonderful. Yeah, I think those
  are great things to be considering. Anything else that you want to make sure that
  we get in here?</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>43:52</u>):</p>\n<p>You know what, I
  will add one more thing, which is simply that it can be hard. I don&#8217;t want
  to make it sound like, oh, you just do a chart or worksheet and then it&#8217;s
  all solved. I&#8217;m thinking of even the simple question. It sounds simple. What
  were family meals like when you were a kid? Or how did you get food in between meals
  when you were a kid? What happened if you were still hungry after you had finished
  the food on your plate? What happened next? Those sound like really simple questions,
  but each of those could be a whole session with a dietician or a therapist. And
  so I&#8217;ll just add, be kind to yourself that Rome wasn&#8217;t built in day
  and your eating habits have built over a lifetime. It doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t
  change them, but awareness and insight are awesome. They don&#8217;t always change
  behavior overnight just because you&#8217;re aware of something, just keep reminding
  yourself like I am work in progress, and I think any step in the right direction
  is still a step, even if there&#8217;s a couple steps back that come after it, there&#8217;s
  nothing to be ashamed of when it comes to your eating.</p>\n<p>(<u>44:56</u>):</p>\n<p>I
  think shame is the last thing we need to add on.</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>45:00</u>):</p>\n<p>Thank
  you. Thank you, Jessica. I&#8217;m so glad we have had this conversation and that
  our listeners can get, I love this structure and some different ways of thinking
  about our relationship with food is always helpful, and maybe this will be really
  a little inspo for somebody to really do this hard work of healing their inner eaters.
  So thanks Jessica for being here.</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>45:26</u>):</p>\n<p>It
  was great.</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>45:26</u>):</p>\n<p>Yes, yes. So listeners,
  if you want to learn more about Jessica, I will have links to her various websites
  and workbooks and workshops in the show notes. So please check that out. And I want

  (<u>00:04</u>):</p>\n<p>Welcome to the Appetite, a podcast brought to you by Opal
  Food and Body Wisdom, an eating disorder treatment clinic in Seattle, Washington.
  On this podcast, we talk about all things food, body movement, and mental health.
  I’m Julie Church dietician, nutrition director and co-founder of Opal, and I’ll
  be your host for today’s show and I get to introduce you to our special guest, Jessica
  Snick, who is here. Welcome.</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>00:29</u>):</p>\n<p>Hello.
  So happy to be here.</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>00:30</u>):</p>\n<p>Yay. So I could
  do all sorts of ways of introducing Jessica. I think we’ve been fairly in the field
  for about the same-ish time, but I think Jessica did predate me some because I got
  first introduced to her by one of her first things that she did to really benefit
  the eating disorder field was that eating disorder bootcamp. And Jessica as a registered
  dietician has been somebody who has been a pioneer in a lot of professional education
  as well as the clinical interface like having her own clients and caseload for many
  years. But she is retired from that now and is really just focusing her attention
  on how she can help individuals in kind of, I think I want to hear more, but really
  a focus almost outside of the nutrition field to maybe enhance the other folks out
  there to know more about eating disorders and hopefully maybe prevent or assess
  better. Yeah. So I want to hear more</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>01:29</u>):</p>\n<p>That,
  okay, eating disorder treatment is so crucially important, but there’s just a big
  but to that, right? Which is that only a very small portion of people with eating
  difficulties ever make it to specialty care. And most people aren’t even diagnosed
  with an eating disorder and still may have difficulties with their eating. So my
  goal was to sort of take the words eating disorder out of the same methods that
  we might use to help someone with an eating disorder, but just remove those words
  so that people who would never in their wildest dreams identify with I have an eating
  disorder, could still learn some of the skills that we use to help people with eating
  disorders</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>02:12</u>):</p>\n<p>That</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick
  (<u>02:12</u>):</p>\n<p>Really can help anyone.</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>02:14</u>):</p>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>Jessica
  Setnick (<u>02:14</u>):</p>\n<p>That’s the goal of healing your inner eater is just
  different wording, but some of the same techniques that we might use on a, I’ll
  say, I don’t know if a lighter scale is the right word, but more of a in-home living
  kind of scale where someone can do it, A DIY, let’s</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>02:30</u>):</p>\n<p>Say,</p>\n<p>Jessica
  Setnick (<u>02:31</u>):</p>\n<p>Versus necessarily needing to as if they don’t even
  identify as someone who might need to meet with a dietician or a therapist. They
  can still do some of these things on their own to really look back. And then of
  course the last page of the workbook says something like, once you’ve done these
  things, you may want to talk with someone about them.</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>02:49</u>):</p>\n<p>Okay,
  wonderful. Yeah. So we are going to get to hear a lot more about this inner eating
  workbook and some of that. Can you speak to, I think the reach beyond the dieticians
  also, and you were also speaking some on your website about just health educators,
  school counselors, maybe first responders, primary care, athletic staff, college
  health. What are you doing in that world to bring your knowledge?</p>\n<p>Jessica
  Setnick (<u>03:17</u>):</p>\n<p>So people tend to think that educating kids about
  nutrition means educating kids about nutrition. It’s not right. It’s like we think
  of nutrition from an adult point of view, nutrients, macronutrients, micronutrients,
  carbs, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, even supplements. We think of all this
  adult conception of language, healthy foods, not healthy foods. Sometimes foods,
  moderation, fun foods, all these things might mean something to us, but to kids
  it’s totally different. Nutrition education isn’t actually talking about nutrition,
  it’s talking about the very, very, very basics. Why do you need food? Food makes
  your body grow, food makes you have energy, food makes you feel good. That’s the
  kind of stuff that we have to talk to kids about. Role modeling, appropriate eating,
  role modeling, not judging other people’s foods. So in other words, my stance is
  trying to say that not talking about nutrition facts and details is not the lack
  of education about nutrition.</p>\n<p>(<u>04:28</u>):</p>\n<p>Those things, kids
  are so concrete. The example I always give is red and green. We teach kids, you
  go on green stop on red, that’s it, right? Because kids don’t have discernment.
  As adults, we know sometimes you stop on green and sometimes you go on red, right?
  But you can’t teach kids that because they don’t have that discernment. So when
  you tell kids something like, oh, I’ll just make something up, pizza is bad for
  you. Then in a child’s mind they take away, if I see my mom eating pizza, something
  bad might happen to her, right? It’s very concrete. They don’t have the discernment
  to say either that was your point of view or eating pizza all the time might not
  be the healthiest choice. They just don’t have that discernment. So in other words,
  we need to stop giving kids discerning nuanced nutrition information that we understand
  and start putting it into very kid appropriate concrete thinking.</p>\n<p>(<u>05:30</u>):</p>\n<p>And
  we don’t want kids to think concretely about food in goods or bads, so therefore
  we have to stop talking to them about it in terms of goods and bads. I love that.
  Instead talk about colors in foods and wait a minute, you ran so fast you must have
  eaten something this morning. You had tons of energy and really simple kind of connections.
  So the same way we talk to kids about their bodies and feeling good about their
  bodies, we’re really not getting into the minutia that’s in our heads. But somehow
  we think if we, that if we deliver that to kids younger, we’re going to prevent
  eating problems. And it’s actually the reverse.</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>06:08</u>):</p>\n<p>So
  you’re as a dietician trying to get to the school counselor or the athletic trainer
  or the coach and helping them broaden their perspective on what nutrition education
  is and</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>06:19</u>):</p>\n<p>Ideally all of them, because
  the more people in an environment, whether it’s a college or whether it’s an elementary
  school or whether it’s a hospital, the more people that have that information, the
  more consistent message is coming through. So this summer I’m speaking to the National
  Association of Health Unit coordinators, which I guess is what we used to call sort
  of a unit secretary. It has a different name now it’s a unit coordinator. So that’s
  someone who doesn’t necessarily have a health professional type of education, but
  they’re interacting with patients all the time. And so it’s wonderful that people
  who aren’t even necessarily involved in that kind of direct patient care but are
  in a hospital setting want to learn about eating disorders. And so I’m doing healing
  your inner eater with them. So that’s the idea is that all of us really need to
  change if we want to prevent eating disorders, and we cannot prevent all of them,
  but we all could benefit from changing the way we talk about food and eating to
  our kids and also ourself because we have an inner eater, which is pretty childlike
  a lot of the time.</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>07:23</u>):</p>\n<p>Okay. Yeah. So what
  you’re saying too, yeah, you’re trying to address, well, yeah, there’s this mainstream
  messaging that diet culture gives us about nutrition and you’re trying to get in
  there to help some of the educators and the influencers that are with others to
  have awareness around that and maybe give some different messages. So I love that.
  So this is sort of a deeper dive into even intro of you, but is there, I think the
  other bigger, I guess organization, I think of you being a part of that you founded
  was ied, which is the International Federation</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>07:55</u>):</p>\n<p>Of
  Eating Eating Disorder, dieticians,</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>07:56</u>):</p>\n<p>Right?
  Of eating disorder dieticians. Is that still up and running? Is that still an organization?
  Oh my gosh,</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>08:00</u>):</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>(<u>08:01</u>):</p>\n<p>So
  IED has just been something that grew bigger than maybe my wildest dreams because
  I am not equipped to be running a nonprofit organization of 900 members. But it’s
  also been wonderful because it gives dieticians who work in the eating disorder
  field of voice and dieticians who didn’t know they were going to be working in the
  eating disorder field, a community. So a lot of the people that join our more sort
  of eating disorder interested, I would say, and I think of IED as my Girl Scout
  best. I don’t know if anyone listening has ever been a Girl Scout or had a Girl
  Scout, but my step baby, Peyton, who’s grown up now, when she was six or seven,
  I used to walk the neighborhood with her selling Girl Scout cookies. I know they
  do it differently now, but at that time you would just walk up to a stranger’s door
  and knock on their door and offer to sell them cookies.</p>\n<p>(<u>08:48</u>):</p>\n<p>Well,
  this is a child who couldn’t order for herself in a restaurant. She’d whisper to
  me what she wanted and then I would tell the server, and yet when she put on that
  Girl scout vest, she would march right up to a stranger’s door and knock on that
  door and sell that person, girl Scout cookies. And so I think of IED as my Girl
  scout vest, for example. I’m talking to government officials. I wrote a letter to
  the secretary of the va. I don’t do those things, but IED gives me the Girl Scout
  vest, right? And I just march right up to the secretary of the va. I mean, I’m writing
  a letter to the Honorable Bull, Doug Collins, a cabinet member and saying, this
  is what’s important to the eating disorder, dieticians and the veterans they serve.
  And so I feel like that’s what IED is really doing behind the scenes. A lot of people
  think of IED as just sort of a membership organization, but we’re doing a ton of
  advocacy work. The goal all along has been to help people get access to care. And
  I feel like in the past two years we’ve really made advances and leaps and bounds
  toward that.</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>09:49</u>):</p>\n<p>That’s awesome. Wonderful
  to hear about that. I think I didn’t even know maybe that that was it, but I did
  notice when, I can’t remember exactly the troubling news or stance that was brought
  out by some national organization if Fed did jump in and wrote an article or got
  some of us all to sign off on something. So I guess I have seen you do that. So
  thank you for that and behalf of many of us dieticians, and I would love, I think
  as listeners already can tell Jessica’s passionate and energetic. So I am excited
  that our paths recross to say, yes, of course you should be on the appetite. And
  today we are going to focus on something she’s already been referencing in terms
  of talking about healing your inner eater and that workbook and workshop that she
  has been creating and doing more in her current state. So healing your inner eater.
  Jessica, can you tell us what is this and how did it start and what is this is a
  workbook, is it workshop? Is it something anybody can do? Is it dietician focused?
  I don’t tell me.</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>10:53</u>):</p>\n<p>So healing your
  inner eater started as a five day workshop at sort of a high end, let’s call it
  a rehab center. And it costs thousands of dollars to go, which I did not get, but
  it was a five day workshop for people who had already been through treatment for
  traumatic events and really wanted to look at how those events might be affecting
  their eating. And so I came up with a curriculum for it, and what was amazing to
  me, again, I didn’t want it to have the word eating disorders in it, so it was called
  Making Food Your Friend again, which is sort of a troubling concept in some ways.
  And so I’m glad I’ve changed the name, but that’s what it was called at the time.
  And the people who came were amazing, I would say potentially could have all been
  diagnosed with eating disorders, but also had amazing stories to tell.</p>\n<p>(<u>11:44</u>):</p>\n<p>And
  in this confidential environment, we made timelines of your life experiences with
  food. And just to give you an example, one of the individuals, and none of this
  will be identifying information recalled as a child, his first eating experience
  was that he remembered being on the ground on all fours, eating grass. And of course
  we had to hear how did that come about? He was something like, and I won’t have
  the exact numbers, but let’s say he was the 10th of 10 children and his mother unfortunately
  died during the childbirth process. So there was only one girl in this family and
  she was 12 or 13 years old. And so for whatever reason, the girl was given this
  baby, a girl’s going to know how to take care of a baby. Well, she certainly didn’t
  know how to take care of the baby. And so he remembers being on the ground on the
  farm with the sheep eating grass because he did not even know he was a human baby
  and remembers throwing up. And so you’re talking about starting out life with some
  very traumatic experiences related to food. And what I found, of course, we handled
  that and discussed it person to person in the group. But from a bigger picture point
  of view, what alerted me and alarmed me is we’re talking about people who have already
  been in treatment for traumatic events in their life and the unhealthy behaviors
  that arose from them, like drinking or drug use. And no one had ever talked with
  this man about this.</p>\n<p>(<u>13:18</u>):</p>\n<p>This is the first time he had
  shared this with anyone. And so that’s what alerted me that so much is going on
  and going into people’s eating that no one is thinking to ask about and talk about.
  And so over time, obviously a five day workshop that costs thousands of dollars
  is not very accessible. And so I shrunk the whole thing into a workbook, change
  the name to healing your inner eater, and now it’s something that people can, yes,
  there are people who come to a workshop when their workplace hires me and what they’re
  hiring me to do in theory is two things, or in reality is two things. One is to
  teach them some of these skills to help the people that they serve, but to do that
  we’re also delivering the content to the people who are attending to look within
  on their own.</p>\n<p>(<u>14:05</u>):</p>\n<p>And so that’s how healing your inner
  eater became what it is. I wanted it to be something accessible where people can
  say, something’s going on with my eating. I may not be able to put my finger on
  it. It may not rise to the level of what I think I need to see a professional about,
  but here’s some ideas of what you could start to look at on your own as a friend
  with your dietician and start to see how those early childhood experiences, and
  not only that, but the people who raised us, what are the messages that we’re still
  carrying? And I know I’ve thrown a lot of words at you, but I’ll sort of close my
  mouth after I say that. When things happen to us when we’re kids, it’s so tempting
  as adults for people, I’ve heard it a million times, well, that’s an exaggeration.</p>\n<p>(<u>14:49</u>):</p>\n<p>I’ve
  heard it a lot of times where say, well, that happened so long ago, it’s not affecting
  me anymore. And I think the opposite, the younger you were when it happened, the
  fewer resources and discernment you had to understand it. The longer you’ve been
  living that storyline, whatever it was that you learned, and the more of your life
  that has been affected by it. And so that is why we really look back to move forward
  because these early experiences are not sometimes things that are really discussed
  or thought about, we think it’s so far in our path.</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>15:22</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah,
  that’s wonderful. I think that is so true, and just to have our listeners hear that
  and go, okay, yeah, it is okay to be pondering or even exploring those things in
  our past to then hopefully move forward in a healthier, more life-giving relationship
  with food. When we started the appetite, it was really to target the same thing
  you’re saying, which is that there’s so many people that will never do treatment
  at Opal, and we wanted there to be something that somebody could tap into, listen
  to get some resources from and do their own healing in the ways that could be accessible.
  So in the same way your workbook and other ways even talking about this on this
  podcast, we’ll be doing that at the same time with appetite, which I love that.
  Why</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>16:05</u>):</p>\n<p>Am I not surprised?</p>\n<p>Julie
  Church (<u>16:08</u>):</p>\n<p>Well, I would love for you to then, I think you’re
  kind of already defined, but your term of inner eater, can you just give me a little
  bit more of an expansive definition of what you mean by that?</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick
  (<u>16:20</u>):</p>\n<p>Yes. There are three parts to your inner eater. All of us,
  we all have an inner eater. There is the inner child, which I’m going to call the
  inner rebel, which is the one that wants what it wants when it wants it, right in
  the middle of the night. I want three nutty bars from little Debbie in my pantry
  and I want to eat them. Then there is the critical society, the internalized voice
  of critical society or diet culture that says, that is ridiculous. That is an insane
  amount of calories. You shouldn’t be eating in the middle of the night. You should
  be asleep and X, Y, Z will happen if you eat those things. And then the third part
  of your inner eater, which for many of us is a very, very tiny little voice, very
  quiet, is the competent adult or the competent eater.</p>\n<p>(<u>17:10</u>):</p>\n<p>And
  the competent eater is the one that sort of navigates between those other two parts
  and says, thank you inner Re for being excited about little Debbie snack cakes and
  thank you critical society who’s trying to keep me safe, but I’m going to make a
  competent decision about this right now. And that decision might be I woke up in
  the middle of the night because I’m hungry, so I’m going to have a nutty bar. And
  it might be I woke up in the middle of the night hungry, so I’m going to have a
  Turkey sandwich. In other words, the competent adult takes the information from
  the other two and figures out what is the best course of action. It doesn’t just
  knee jerk react between one and two. But one of the things that you sent me as far
  as questions you thought you might ask, I hope I ask it myself. I hope it’s okay.
  What is the impact of when your competent adult isn’t? Well, it’s because it’s that
  you’re bouncing back and forth between that inner rebel and that critical society
  voice without a lot of input from the competent adult. And that’s when you see overeating
  undereating and a lot of regret and guilt about</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>18:15</u>):</p>\n<p>Both.
  That’s such an impact.</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>18:18</u>):</p>\n<p>And never
  feeling like you’re doing it right or eating, and I’m using finger quotes for the
  people who can’t see my hands right now.</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>18:26</u>):</p>\n<p>I
  can’t see your hands, but yes, that is good to say. That is good to say. So then,
  if one is wanting to do that journey of inner eater and build becoming a competent
  eater and have awareness around the rebel awareness of the critical society, diet
  culture, what are some of the ways to do that? Or what’s the journey?</p>\n<p>Jessica
  Setnick (<u>18:48</u>):</p>\n<p>So the goal, and sometimes we have to build up to
  a goal, but the ultimate goal is to be able to hear the competent eater voice either
  as loudly as the other two or almost sometimes in place of the other two, that it’s
  instead of having angel and devil on your shoulders and feeling like you have to
  have this other voice come in and navigate between them or negotiate between them,
  the competent eater voice becomes more of our inner north star, our compass. Of
  course, in times of stress, the inner rebel and the critical society may become
  louder, but the goal is to really give that competent eater a voice, that competent
  adult voice. And the way to do that at first is to start listening for all three
  voices. So for example, when someone is feeling conflicted about what to do next
  to think, okay, what’s my inner rebel saying?</p>\n<p>(<u>19:44</u>):</p>\n<p>What’s
  my inner critical society voice saying? And then what are the other options? And
  the best way to spot when you are battling between inner rebel and critical society
  is if you can only see two options. So let’s say you and I, Julie are sitting at
  lunch and in your mind you’re battling back and forth, I could eat a dry salad or
  I could have a cheeseburger, fries and a milkshake, and the menu might have, oh
  my gosh, let’s say we’re at the Cheesecake Factory. There’s like 40,000 things on
  that menu, but all you can see is there’s a right choice and a wrong choice. That’s
  what tells you that you are in black and white thinking. You are just battling between
  these two voices. And so you have to sort of identify that. And you might say, Jessica,
  all I can see right now is I could have a dry salad and be good, or I could have
  a cheeseburger milkshake and fries and be satisfied.</p>\n<p>(<u>20:36</u>):</p>\n<p>Can
  you help? And I might say, well, I think you could have both of those things or
  either of those things, but tell me you’re thinking about it. What else? What are
  the options? How would you guide me if I said those things? And so it’s sort of
  a conversation you can, I’m just depicting it as a conversation with another person,
  but it can even be a conversation with yourself. Because the truth is you could
  have a salad and a milkshake. You could have a cheeseburger and a fruit plate when
  you could only see two options. That means your competent adult is hiding over in
  a corner. And so we got to bring the competent adult out and say things like, what
  sounds good to me? How hungry am I? What will be my next eating opportunity? How
  much money is in my pocket? Et cetera, et cetera. And the competent adult uses all
  kinds of determining factors on why to make choices about food. Whereas the inner
  rebel and critical society only use this false dichotomy of what’s good for me and
  what’s bad for</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>21:36</u>):</p>\n<p>Me. That’s awesome.
  Yeah, I love that. Just it’s the awareness, increasing of awareness and allowing
  for the conversations that happen in our own mind and heart about food to matter.
  It’s like just make that matter.</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>21:51</u>):</p>\n<p>That’s
  a mic drop moment. Yes. The conversations that happen in our food and mind make
  them matter. I love that.</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>21:58</u>):</p>\n<p>Yes. Yeah,
  because I think so many times, especially when somebody’s maybe on a diet or struggling
  with eating disorder, it’s like this thing, I just got to push it away. I got to
  just push it away. I got to push it away. But I do think, no, this slows everybody
  down maybe to say, Hey, to have my own awareness about this and listen actually
  could help me in this moment and then allow for me to make the decision I want to
  with my food.</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>22:23</u>):</p>\n<p>And because that’s
  the goal. And I said, sometimes we have to take steps to get toward the goal. Sometimes
  it can go either way. Either we can hear those inner voices and think, oh my gosh,
  where did I get this idea that these are my only options and trace it back? Or sometimes
  you have to go the other way and look at the formative years of your life to be
  able to hear those specific voices. And that’s where a timeline comes in. And looking
  at the people who raised you. Yeah,</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>22:52</u>):</p>\n<p>And
  that’s one of the things about the workbook, I was excited to get into this and
  hear how you’re navigating this, but the workbook description does talk about the
  importance of looking back to move forward. And part of that is exploring one’s
  caregivers and their own experiences with their food relationship and perhaps maybe
  the feeding relationship between that caregiver and yourself. So tell me more how
  you do that and</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>23:15</u>):</p>\n<p>Sure. So I am going
  to use the term eating legacy to describe everything that came before us that we
  inherited. And so we are the product of the people who survive. So in other words,
  we are the product of our caregivers. They are the product of their caregivers.
  And I always say caregivers because not everyone was raised by a family member or
  by a parent or parent. So anyone that impacted you. And in the workbook there’s
  a circle for you. And then there are many circles around because we were impacted
  by many people other than our primary caregivers. So the idea is to identify the
  people that were involved in your early childhood life and ideally, hopefully those
  people all had your best interests at heart, even if it didn’t seem like it, there
  may be some people in there who didn’t, and that can be traumatic on its own.</p>\n<p>(<u>24:08</u>):</p>\n<p>But
  one of the key things that we try to talk about in the workshop is just because
  the people who were raising you were trying their best. We don’t have to blame them
  for causing problems. That doesn’t mean that they saw you for who you were and exactly
  what you needed. So we have to look at not just the people who raised us, but what
  was their eating experience when they were kids and the people who raised them.
  And so we have to keep going back because the truth is we are a product of people
  who lived thousands of years ago. And I love to say that people pleasing is a survival
  skill. We learned a long time ago in our genes that if you don’t stay with the group,
  then you can’t survive. And so we are descended from the people who were able to
  conform to survive in the short term that plays out as if I play peekaboo with these
  weirdos, then they will feed me and change my diaper when I need it. And so we learned
  to go along to get along. Another example is let’s say thousands of years ago, who’s
  going to survive when there’s not enough food? The person who says, oh, well I guess
  there’s not enough food. Or the person who gets hangry and says, out of my way people,
  I got to go find some food.</p>\n<p>(<u>25:23</u>):</p>\n<p>So we are descended
  from the people that got hangry when they didn’t get enough to eat. So these are
  the kind of things that we have to recognize that we think our individual eating
  behavior is our conscious choice and we make our own destiny. And the message of
  diet culture definitely tells us if something’s going wrong with your eating, just
  change your mind. Do it differently when really we are reacting to generations and
  generations of eating experiences. Some of them far back, but also some of them
  very recent. And I’m thinking of the stories that people tell at the workshop, and
  some of them will make you cry. I mean, I’m thinking of someone who said that her
  grandmother always cried at big family meals, and she would ask Grandpa, why is
  grandma sad? And he would say, no, grandma’s crying because she’s happy. And she
  didn’t understand until she was an adult that her grandma grew up in a dust bowl
  situation either in Kansas or Oklahoma, somewhere during the depression where there
  wasn’t enough food.</p>\n<p>(<u>26:23</u>):</p>\n<p>And apparently the minister
  would come over to her family’s house every Sunday after church, and the children
  were not allowed to eat until the grownups were done, that the parents didn’t want
  to tell the minister that they were struggling. So they’d put out as much of a spread
  as they could, and the kids would basically watch the minister eating seconds and
  thirds knowing that that meant they weren’t going to have anything to eat. And so
  for this grandma now to be an adult and to see her whole family with grandkids and
  everyone sitting around the table with enough to eat really moved her to tears every
  single time. And so that’s just an example of the way that our patterns are transmitted
  through generations. And if we don’t have an explanation, which a lot of times we
  don’t have the luxury of an explanation, we have made up our own story about those
  things and it may be affecting our eating still till now.</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>27:13</u>):</p>\n<p>How
  do you guide folks if they don’t know that story? Are there ways that you help them
  put some of the pieces together?</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>27:22</u>):</p>\n<p>That’s
  an interesting question, and I am not sure I’ve ever thought of it quite that way,
  but I am good at reading between the lines, and probably you are too. And we’ve
  both seen a lot of individuals and heard a lot of their eating stories. And so to
  be able to give someone ideas, possibilities. So some of the possibilities include
  the fact that none of us, I may not know your heritage, but there is no one alive
  today who isn’t somewhere descended in the past few generations from someone who
  went through a refugee situation, a food insecurity situation, the Great Depression,
  the Holocaust. There’s all kinds of different ways that people have been traumatized
  with regard to food. And so even if you don’t know exactly what your caregivers
  went through, that there was some of that in there somewhere. That’s why we all,
  not we, but many of us have grown up with, you have to eat everything on your plate.</p>\n<p>(<u>28:16</u>):</p>\n<p>There’s
  children starving in blank. And so there are themes that we can predict probably
  happened to someone based on their eating behavior. Someone who, for example, hides
  food. We can say, do you think that there was a situation in your past where someone
  didn’t have enough to eat and so you learned to store food somewhere or someone
  who had an unsafe situation where food was stolen from them, and so they learned
  to hide food in a certain way. We can sort of conjecture, even if we don’t know
  for sure, we can look at the outcome behaviors and suggest possibilities of how
  that might have transpired. And sometimes we kind of sound like mind readers when
  we say something like that. And then a patient once told me that he was adopted
  and his adopted parents, so it became his parents. His parents had a biological
  son almost the same age, and that son had a totally different body type. And so
  the biological son was allowed to eat whatever he wanted, and the adopted son being
  larger was only allowed to have one portion. And this developed into an adult situation
  where he can eat whatever he wants and his inner child is still telling him to binge
  eat</p>\n<p>(<u>29:27</u>):</p>\n<p>Because now he can have whatever he wants. So
  he’s rebelling against those childhood experiences. So we’ve heard enough of those
  stories that we can sometimes kind of say, I wonder if there was ever a time blah,
  blah, blah. And then someone’s like, oh my gosh, how did you know? And it’s because
  we can sort of read the tea leaves of their current eating behaviors and imagine
  what their past eating trauma might have been.</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>29:49</u>):</p>\n<p>Totally.
  I love all that. Yes, there is so much richness in that and hope the listeners are
  encouraged to kind of think back and explore that. I also am aware of some research
  that talks about the importance and the value of exploring one’s ethnic identity
  and having a connection to their roots. And I think about identity when we think
  about culture and religion and ethnicity is food. There’s so much around food that
  comes out, and I’m so aware that the influence of racism and there still is systemic
  oppression that keeps some from feeling like they can fully eat the foods that are
  connected to their family, connected to their heritage, their religion and culture,
  and do that in a public place or do that in the ways that they may want to. I do
  wonder, when you talk about that healing, there’s this awareness of like, okay,
  this is my lineage. What did you say? My eating legacy? Yeah. So what do I know
  about that? And then now in my current context, how do I then proceed to do this
  in a safe way, in a way that I feel like I can be what honored, respected?</p>\n<p>(<u>31:03</u>):</p>\n<p>What
  about that?</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>31:04</u>):</p>\n<p>There’s two parts of
  that. One is that just because your eating legacy, the heritage of your ancestors
  may have been erased by more recent generations who were trying to go along to get
  along and trying to fit into the culture because that’s what meant safety and survival.
  That is okay for you to bring back some of those things, even if let’s say your
  grandma didn’t make those things, there is someone out there that knows how to make
  those things and you can experiment with ’em and you may not even eating all of
  them, but that’s what you can. And that’s the beauty of the internet and social
  media and some of the things that bring so much crap into our lives also sometimes
  brings some beauty into our lives because we can find people who have preserved
  some of those food ways and be able to bring those back into our lineage and our
  legacy for the future, even if they weren’t directly transmitted to us.</p>\n<p>(<u>31:58</u>):</p>\n<p>And
  I hear you on all of that social justice aspect and the systemic determinants of
  health, social determinants of health, and there’s so many buzzwords around it,
  but the idea basically being that certain parts of our heritage were erased because
  they were considered not okay. And unfortunately, I think there’s some heritage
  of dietician work doing that too. I mean if you look at any of the pictures of the
  dietician conferences of the early 19th, or sorry, early 20th century, you look
  at all of these stern looking crabby white women, there were black dieticians and
  there were people working in other areas, but they weren’t given a voice. And so
  the voice of dieticians tends to be sort of one of erasure unfortunately. And so
  it’s important that all of us bring interesting food ways and sort of heritage,
  legacy food ways into our lives and for our kids, even if they weren’t our heritage.</p>\n<p>(<u>32:53</u>):</p>\n<p>And
  that’s a beautiful thing too, but all the factors that are in our society, all of
  our ancestors had the factors in their societies. And so that’s why it’s so hard
  to be the change maker because you’re the person working to change generations of
  behaviors and generations of society. So I almost think of it as, and let’s just
  call it a slow moving train because I don’t love the idea of someone trying to push
  a train back, but I do, I think of it as a train of many cars and you’re trying
  to push it back so that it doesn’t keep going to your children, and it’s a huge
  job for the person who’s in the middle, not just because of let’s say, finding these
  legacy food ways that have sort of been erased, not just because of trying to undo
  things that you were taught and trying to change our thinking, which are very hard
  things, but also because some of those people are still alive and they may get hurt
  feelings.</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>33:48</u>):</p>\n<p>Yes.</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick
  (<u>33:49</u>):</p>\n<p>When you say, in our family we do X, Y, z, and your parents
  or your grandparents are looking at you or shaking their head or giving you the
  look or I can’t believe you let your kids eat like that. It can be very hard on
  the change maker because you’re trying to convey, I don’t judge what you did, but
  we are doing things differently in our family and for some reason we are better
  at doing that in other areas. Let’s just say you got sent to summer camp every summer
  and you’ve decided that you want your kid to have a free range summer and just play
  in the backyard. It’s somehow easier to say that than to say, you know what? I really
  don’t like gefilte fish, so we’re not going to have gefilte fish at Rosh Hashanah
  or something like that. And being Jewish, I can really equate this food is heritage
  type of idea.</p>\n<p>(<u>34:40</u>):</p>\n<p>It becomes really hard, and I was
  trying to explain it. I was asked to speak about it to a group of people who are
  not Jewish, and I was trying to explain that when someone with an eating disorder,
  and it could include people with food preferences, but this was specifically eating
  disorder professionals. When someone with an eating disorder, let’s just say I don’t
  want to eat lakas at Hanukkah, those don’t feel like they’re supportive to my recovery
  maybe another year, but this year is not that year that sometimes people, family
  members can hear like You’re rejecting Judaism. Our great grandparents went through
  the Holocaust and they came to America with one pair of shoes and a nickel. And
  it’s like, oh my gosh, all you said was, I don’t really like a filter fish or I
  don’t feel safe around. And someone heard that as you’re rejecting your entire culture.
  So that can be a really fraught area and we have to be able to navigate it and somehow
  it feels so much harder when you’re talking about food and eating because it’s so
  ingrained in culture than it does when you’re talking about something much more
  simple. Yeah, I know you like rose’s mom, but I really like daisies. Somehow food
  and eating is just so much</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>35:54</u>):</p>\n<p>More. Totally.
  Which is what makes it so amazing. I mean, it is so much more, and we can take the
  time and have those,</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>36:03</u>):</p>\n<p>It also explains
  why it’s hard.</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>36:04</u>):</p>\n<p>It does. It does. And
  I think what you’re saying too is those conversations might just need some tending
  to and some care and be mindful that, okay, I don’t want to just drop this and move
  on, but maybe bring it with some care if you are going to be asking other older
  family members to maybe do something different or you’re just sharing your experience
  of what’s going to work for you in this season to just,</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick
  (<u>36:28</u>):</p>\n<p>Or the love of all humanity, do not have these conversations
  at a time</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>36:33</u>):</p>\n<p>Meal. That’s totally, it’s
  easier if food’s not around and we’re not talking about it in real time, but we’re
  more allowing for somebody to take in. Oh, okay. So this summer party is going to
  be different than last year. Okay, I got it. I got it. Yeah, so true. So true. Okay,
  so what else? I guess we’re talking about maybe specific, and I feel like you’re
  tapping into this, but I do think that some parents, especially if you’re bringing
  anything that’s related to eating disorder, so if somebody says, wow, how you, I’m
  learning about my child and rebel. I’m learning about my critical society voice
  and I’m hearing some things that happened in our household and that stuff I’m needing
  to filter through and that can make a caregiver maybe be defensive or feel really
  guilty. And so any, I guess for both people listening, right, like the caregivers
  listening as well as maybe the folks that are wanting to talk to their caregivers
  either direction, but how do you deal with that potential shame blame piece</p>\n<p>Jessica
  Setnick (<u>37:39</u>):</p>\n<p>With that? Yes. Well, in the same way that we would
  tell an individual, you are a product of your society, your time that you are alive
  and the people who lived before you, I would say the same thing to a caregiver,
  you are a product of your society, and so let’s just take it off of food for a minute.
  You thought that the best thing was to send your child to summer camp. They decided
  to not do that, right? That doesn’t mean your choice was wrong and it may have affected
  your child in a certain way, but they’re trying to do things differently in their
  family and it doesn’t mean that you were wrong. That’s such a hard thing because
  I think even in jobs, it feels like if we do it a different way, we’re somehow saying
  the other way was wrong, instead of just adapting and saying, this is a different
  time, this is a different child, this is a different family, and I think we have
  to really make room for that feeling of, but I feel like I disappointed you. I didn’t
  that asking you to eat all your peas was going to make you feel guilty. I didn’t
  realize that. I thought that’s what we were supposed to do.</p>\n<p>(<u>38:44</u>):</p>\n<p>And
  to say, absolutely, I understand that I’m not blaming you. I’m simply saying let’s
  change our eating legacy together for the next generation. So really bringing that
  caregiver into the new plan instead of saying, I’m not doing it your way, so you
  therefore can’t be involved. And to even say something like, I know it’s going to
  be a big shift, and so if I hear you saying to my child, you need to finish that,
  I’m just going to say, oh, you know what? Everyone in our home just eats what they’re
  hungry for. I love you mom, and I’m going to give you a hug. In other words, wrap
  the message in kindness so that we can attend to those feelings of those ancestors
  almost as if you, the same as you would if you were able to communicate with someone
  from 300 years ago and you would say, wow, you went through some tough stuff, but
  I don’t want to live without air conditioning just because you did. It’s that kind
  of thing. Just because somebody had a different food experience doesn’t mean you
  have to continue living the legacy of it. It’s not insulting to them, but it’s harder
  when it’s a living person because that person has feelings and it’s appropriate
  to attend to those and maybe have a counselor in the room if need be when that happens,
  if you’re concerned.</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>40:04</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah, I was thinking
  that of course, because at Opal it’s a treatment setting where we have family relationship
  therapists and this is some of the content that certainly happens in that formal
  way. And I do think, yeah, if somebody is really wrestling and struggling in the
  midst of an eating disorder, having professional help to have some of these conversations
  is so normal, and that is such something we recommend could be a therapist, could
  be a dietician that could help facilitate some of that and the others that are out
  there that are wanting to have those conversations. I think it is also something
  that can be done, like you said, maybe in the backyard in the afternoon or being
  brought, oh, I want to talk through the fact that, yeah, I’m going to have you watch
  the kids a few days this summer, and I’m really trying to reset this for myself
  and the family.</p>\n<p>(<u>40:51</u>):</p>\n<p>I would love for you to do it this
  way too. I know when I was raising my kids and had nannies, I had some stuff related
  to food relationship in the contract that I had with them just to have it written,
  because for me, it felt important to be able to have language, common language and
  have them see how serious and important it was to me. So maybe I’m more formal in
  that way, but I think in the family relationships when you’re not writing a contract
  for the aunt to come over once a month, it might be different, but I do feel like
  it’s still very much just having things in</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>41:24</u>):</p>\n<p>Writing
  is not a bad idea. I might recommend a different form, like a book. I read this
  book and it gave me some great ideas. I wonder if you’d be willing to read this
  book. We had a book like that in my family that I think five copies were bought
  and everyone got their own copy, and it was sort of read this and let’s discuss
  if we want to move forward with these ideas.</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>41:42</u>):</p>\n<p>So
  cool. I love that. Okay, so this workbook is obviously something we can have access
  to from your website. You also seem to be somebody that would do it for your workplace
  or do it at your place of worship or do it in your community mom’s group or whatever.
  People could bring you in to do something it sounds like, which is so cool.</p>\n<p>Jessica
  Setnick (<u>42:03</u>):</p>\n<p>Exactly.</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>42:04</u>):</p>\n<p>Is
  there anything else you’d want our listeners to know about the healing of your inner
  eater and what you’re offering?</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>42:12</u>):</p>\n<p>Well,
  I think it’s a big job. I will say healing your inner eater is the workshop and
  workbook is a start. You can go to healing your inner eater.com and I’ll make a
  code podcast. If someone wants to use the code podcast, it’ll bring the price down
  of the workbook, and then I’m thinking about having maybe an online group. I’m not
  exactly sure what form that will take, but I’ll keep you</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>42:33</u>):</p>\n<p>Posted.
  Okay, wonderful. So Jessica, when I think about bringing these concepts into formally
  into somebody’s recovery from an eating disorder, how would you say that that could
  be done, or what are some of your recommendations there?</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick
  (<u>42:47</u>):</p>\n<p>Well, it sounds like you’re already doing a lot of this
  at Opal, which is amazing. And as I said before, I feel like some of this is actually,
  we’re taking it from eating disorder recovery and pulling it out to the community,
  but I think it is important for anyone who is in a situation where they are helping
  individuals with eating disorders to really be thinking along the lines of, this
  didn’t start with this person. Yes, they may have had these genes. Yes, they may
  have had this incident that sparked their eating disorder, but we need to take it
  off of the idea of this is this person’s individual responsibility because that’s
  what always feels so blaming. And instead add in the idea of those social determinants
  of health, of family influences, caregiver influences beyond the family, and then
  ancestral influences and things that were done to harm members of our ancestor community.
  I think that those are important things to bring into eating disorder treatment
  if it’s not already there. Okay,</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>43:46</u>):</p>\n<p>Wonderful.
  Yeah, I think those are great things to be considering. Anything else that you want
  to make sure that we get in here?</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>43:52</u>):</p>\n<p>You
  know what, I will add one more thing, which is simply that it can be hard. I don’t
  want to make it sound like, oh, you just do a chart or worksheet and then it’s all
  solved. I’m thinking of even the simple question. It sounds simple. What were family
  meals like when you were a kid? Or how did you get food in between meals when you
  were a kid? What happened if you were still hungry after you had finished the food
  on your plate? What happened next? Those sound like really simple questions, but
  each of those could be a whole session with a dietician or a therapist. And so I’ll
  just add, be kind to yourself that Rome wasn’t built in day and your eating habits
  have built over a lifetime. It doesn’t mean you can’t change them, but awareness
  and insight are awesome. They don’t always change behavior overnight just because
  you’re aware of something, just keep reminding yourself like I am work in progress,
  and I think any step in the right direction is still a step, even if there’s a couple
  steps back that come after it, there’s nothing to be ashamed of when it comes to
  your eating.</p>\n<p>(<u>44:56</u>):</p>\n<p>I think shame is the last thing we
  need to add on.</p>\n<p>Julie Church (<u>45:00</u>):</p>\n<p>Thank you. Thank you,
  Jessica. I’m so glad we have had this conversation and that our listeners can get,
  I love this structure and some different ways of thinking about our relationship
  with food is always helpful, and maybe this will be really a little inspo for somebody
  to really do this hard work of healing their inner eaters. So thanks Jessica for
  being here.</p>\n<p>Jessica Setnick (<u>45:26</u>):</p>\n<p>It was great.</p>\n<p>Julie
  Church (<u>45:26</u>):</p>\n<p>Yes, yes. So listeners, if you want to learn more
  about Jessica, I will have links to her various websites and workbooks and workshops
  in the show notes. So please check that out. And I want to thank Jack Straw Cultural

---

In the podcast "The Appetite 141: Healing Your Inner Eater," Julie Church interviews Jessica Setnick, the creator of the “Healing Your Inner Eater” workshop and workbook. Setnick emphasizes how early experiences with food shape current eating behaviors and encourages listeners to explore their "inner eater," which consists of three parts: the inner child (or rebel), the critical societal voice, and the competent adult. The inner child seeks immediate gratification, while the critical voice enforces societal norms and expectations about food. The competent adult helps navigate these conflicting impulses to make balanced decisions about eating. 

Setnick's approach aims to make the concepts of eating disorder treatment more accessible to everyone, not just those who identify as having an eating disorder. She advocates for a shift in nutrition education, particularly for children, focusing on basic concepts of food and health rather than complex nutritional details. The workbook offers individuals a chance to reflect on their past experiences with food and develop a healthier relationship with eating. The episode serves as a resource for anyone looking to understand and improve their relationship with food through self-exploration and personal growth.
