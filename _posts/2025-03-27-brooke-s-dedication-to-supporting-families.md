In 2011, Brooke Gibson faced a difficult decision between a job that negatively impacted her mental health and pursuing her education full-time to improve her family's future. Opting for education, she struggled to pay rent as a full-time student with two young sons and sought help from Wellspring Family Services. They provided essential support by covering her past-due rent and one month of future rent, allowing her to focus on her studies. With a stable home, Brooke completed her degree in Business Economics at Seattle University and secured a brighter future for her family. Now a homeowner and Community Lending Officer at Washington Trust Bank, she assists first-time homebuyers, drawing from her own experiences to emphasize the importance of stable housing. "Housing is the foundation for everything," she asserts, highlighting how it enables individuals to aspire and plan for the future rather than merely surviving day-to-day. Proud of her South Seattle roots, Brooke is committed to giving back to the community that supported her, advocating for the necessity of affordable housing for all. "Everyone deserves a place to call home," she affirms.
