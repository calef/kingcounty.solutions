On a cool September morning, Pacific Northwest canoe families gathered for the ninth annual Paddle for the Battle event along Hood Canal, honoring cancer survivors and raising prayers for the health of the Salish Sea community. Eleven canoes launched, each carrying cancer champions—survivors and loved ones—while skippers led with songs and prayers of healing. Upon reaching the ancestral lands of the Skokomish Tribe, participants were welcomed with traditional songs and drumming. The event drew over 300 guests and tribal members who shared a meal featuring traditional foods, promoting cultural continuity and resilience. Funds raised during the event will assist tribal members with travel to medical appointments and alleviate some financial burdens associated with cancer. This successful gathering was made possible through strong partnerships, including support from Native Journeywoman and Cancer Lifeline's Harmony Retreats program. Additionally, multiple tribal grants contributed to the event's success. The Paddle for the Battle reflects the importance of raising awareness about cancer screening and support as a cultural and spiritual effort, reinforcing solidarity with Indigenous communities and addressing health disparities among them.
