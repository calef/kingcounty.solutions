Peggy, 78, reflects on her years as a caregiver for her mother and boyfriend, acknowledging the toll it took on her physical and mental health, especially after they passed away. Facing financial difficulties without government support for caregivers, she moved to Marian Housing Center in Racine, Wisconsin, seeking affordable housing. At the center, she found a community with various activities but learned the importance of balancing her time between social engagement and personal care.

Peggy benefited from a partnership between Mercy Housing Lakefront and Society’s Assets, receiving new hearing aids after going without them for decades. Living with chronic health conditions, she values the onsite exercise programs organized by Jo Ann Rodriguez, the Resident Service Coordinator, through a collaboration with FoodWIse. These programs have been crucial for her physical and mental well-being. However, recent budget cuts have led to the discontinuation of these classes, which concerns Peggy and other residents who relied on them for health improvements. Efforts are underway to find alternative resources to continue supporting the residents' health needs.
