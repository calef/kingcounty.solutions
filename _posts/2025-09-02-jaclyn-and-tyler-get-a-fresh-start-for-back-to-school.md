Jaclyn and her son, Tyler, recently overcame a challenging period of homelessness, exacerbated by the summer heat and lack of stability. After reaching out to Mary’s Place, they received dedicated support from an outreach specialist who helped them search for a safe home suitable for their family, including their two dogs. Despite Jaclyn's disability complicating the housing search, their persistence paid off when they found a pet-friendly apartment near Tyler's school just before the new school year started. Tyler is now enjoying his new space, complete with a kitchen table for homework and a bedroom for friends. While this success story highlights community generosity, the article emphasizes the ongoing housing crisis in King County, where nearly half of renter households are cost-burdened. Among low-income families, the situation is even more dire, with 70% paying over 30% of their income on housing. Unexpected expenses can easily destabilize these families. Mary’s Place is committed to ending family homelessness through a three-pronged approach of shelter, outreach, and prevention, along with advocating for equitable housing policies.
