  For weeks, Jaclyn and her son, Tyler, had been experiencing homelessness. The summer heat made every day unbearable - there was no escape from the sun, no cool place to rest, and no stability.

  When she reached out to Mary’s Place, she was connected with one of our outreach specialists — someone who walked alongside her with patience, optimism, and unwavering support.

  Together, they set out to find a safe, stable home where Jaclyn, Tyler, and their two beloved dogs could finally rest. The journey wasn’t easy. Jaclyn lives with a disability, which sometimes makes navigating housing searches and applications a challenge. On top of that, she and Tyler love their dogs dearly, and finding an affordable, pet-friendly apartment that would also approve her application was proving to be a challenge.

Jaclyn and her son, Tyler, recently overcame a challenging period of homelessness, exacerbated by the summer heat and lack of stability. After reaching out to Mary’s Place, they received dedicated support from an outreach specialist who helped them search for a safe home suitable for their family, including their two dogs. Despite Jaclyn's disability complicating the housing search, their persistence paid off when they found a pet-friendly apartment near Tyler's school just before the new school year started. Tyler is now enjoying his new space, complete with a kitchen table for homework and a bedroom for friends. While this success story highlights community generosity, the article emphasizes the ongoing housing crisis in King County, where nearly half of renter households are cost-burdened. Among low-income families, the situation is even more dire, with 70% paying over 30% of their income on housing. Unexpected expenses can easily destabilize these families. Mary’s Place is committed to ending family homelessness through a three-pronged approach of shelter, outreach, and prevention, along with advocating for equitable housing policies.
