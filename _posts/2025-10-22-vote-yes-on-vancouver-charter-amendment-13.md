title: Vote Yes on Vancouver Charter Amendment 13

Vote Yes on Charter Amendment 13 to promote equitable representation in Vancouver, Washington. The current at-large voting system dilutes the voices of many residents, particularly communities of color, making it difficult for them to elect representatives who reflect their experiences and needs. Charter Amendment 13 proposes a shift to district voting, allowing neighborhoods like Fourth Plain, Fruit Valley, and East Mill Plain to have their own representatives, thereby increasing accountability and ensuring that local concerns are prioritized.

District voting has been successfully implemented in cities like Seattle, Tacoma, and Spokane, enhancing local representation and community power. The amendment aims to create a city council that better mirrors the diversity of Vancouver’s population. Inatai supports this initiative, emphasizing that while Charter Amendment 13 is a crucial step, achieving true representation will also require active voter engagement in local issues and elections.

Residents are encouraged to vote Yes on November 4, which will help dismantle barriers to City Hall and ensure every community has a voice in the decision-making processes that affect their lives.
