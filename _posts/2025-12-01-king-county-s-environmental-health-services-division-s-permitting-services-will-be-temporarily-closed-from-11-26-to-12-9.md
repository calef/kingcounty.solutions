King County's Environmental Health Services Division will temporarily close its permitting services from November 26 to December 9. This closure is to accommodate system upgrades and improvements. During this period, the division will not process any permit applications, and customers are encouraged to plan accordingly. The division will resume normal operations on December 10. For any urgent matters, individuals can contact the division via email or phone, but responses may be delayed due to the closure. The county emphasizes the importance of these upgrades in enhancing service efficiency and effectiveness.
