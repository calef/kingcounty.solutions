It's auction season! LIHI is hosting both virtual and live fundraising events to engage supporters. The Gala & Live Auction will take place on December 5th at the Four Seasons Seattle, marking their first event since the pandemic. Attendees can enjoy a happy hour, silent auction, gala dinner, live auction, dessert dash, and a program in the ballroom. Limited seating is available, so purchasing tickets early is recommended.

The Virtual Auction runs from November 19 to December 3, with registration available for free to preview auction items. This auction aims to raise funds for Supportive Services, Tiny Houses, and Urban Rest Stops, offering participants a chance to bid on various fun and fancy items. Donations for auction items are still welcome, and interested parties can find more information on how to contribute.
