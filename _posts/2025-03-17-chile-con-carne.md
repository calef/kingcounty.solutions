Chile con carne is a hearty dish featuring ground beef or beef chuck and a blend of spices. The recipe, adapted from Brandi Henderson, yields about 3 quarts. Key ingredients include 5 tablespoons of ancho chili powder, 2 tablespoons of dried oregano, 1.5 tablespoons of ground cumin, and 2 pounds of ground beef or 3 pounds of sliced beef chuck. Additional ingredients are onions, garlic, jalapeno peppers, canned tomatoes, water, brown sugar, red wine vinegar, and kidney beans.

To prepare, start by toasting the spices in a skillet. In a large pot, heat oil and brown the beef in batches. After browning, sauté onions in the beef fat, add jalapenos, and then garlic and spices. Mix in the canned tomatoes with their juice, water, brown sugar, and vinegar, bringing the mixture to a simmer. Allow it to cook uncovered for 1 to 1.5 hours until reduced. Finally, add the ground beef and drained kidney beans, simmering for an additional 5-10 minutes until heated through. The dish is recommended to be served the next day and can be garnished with toppings like sour cream, cilantro, or tortilla strips.
