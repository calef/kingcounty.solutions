DESC has introduced a new injectable-only buprenorphine starting protocol for treating opioid use disorder, focusing on a low-threshold outpatient setting for individuals using fentanyl. A study involving 95 patients with moderate to severe opioid use disorder demonstrated that this protocol yields significantly higher retention rates compared to previous treatment methods. Specifically, 75% of participants completed a three-day injection series, and 64% continued treatment with a second monthly dose. This approach allows individuals to initiate treatment without needing to cease fentanyl use and includes housing and comprehensive support services. The findings suggest that this method is particularly effective for adults facing mental health issues and chronic homelessness.
