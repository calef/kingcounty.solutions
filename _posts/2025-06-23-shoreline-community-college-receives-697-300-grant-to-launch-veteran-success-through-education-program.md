Shoreline Community College has received a $697,300 grant through the Supporting Student Veterans and Their Families initiative, funded by the King County Veterans, Seniors and Human Services Levy. This grant will help launch the Veteran Success Through Education program, a two-year pilot aimed at providing comprehensive support for veterans and their families, especially those from marginalized communities. The program, running from July 2025 to June 2027, will offer culturally responsive case management, academic and financial assistance, and wraparound services for eligible students. 

The initiative targets underrepresented veterans, including BIPOC, LGBTQ+ individuals, and those who have exhausted or are ineligible for VA benefits. Operation Military Family will provide individualized case management and assist in connecting veterans in need. The funding will cover tuition, incidental expenses, and housing assistance. Shoreline's robust student support services, including dedicated Veterans services and academic advising, will also be available to participants. The program aims to empower veterans, helping them navigate higher education and pursue new career paths post-service. As a pilot, it may inform and expand future veteran support programs across King County.
