Juma is committed to fostering an inclusive culture by creating safe and affirming environments for both its youth and staff. Recently, staff from various locations engaged in discussions about the significance of language in promoting inclusivity. This initiative began with conversations aimed at examining terminology used to describe Juma youth and their circumstances. Recognizing the diverse backgrounds and experiences of their staff, many of whom are former Juma youth, the organization sought to develop a more dynamic resource than a traditional glossary. 

As a result, they are creating an Inclusive Language Guide, designed to offer thoughtful guidance rather than fixed definitions, reflecting the fluidity of language based on context and audience. The guide emphasizes person-centered language, focusing on individual experiences and recognizing the unique identities of the youth served. In its prototype phase, the guide aims to honor the dignity and potential of young adults, address systemic challenges, and promote empowerment and respect. Juma's commitment to this evolving approach to language highlights the importance of shaping narratives that support inclusivity and understanding.
