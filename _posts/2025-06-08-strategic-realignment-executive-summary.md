The WA 211 Board of Directors has undertaken a strategic realignment process starting in January 2023, aimed at addressing longstanding structural and funding challenges that hinder access to the WA 211 system. This initiative is rooted in extensive discussions involving community voices, including call center representatives and diverse stakeholders, highlighting the necessity for inclusive access to critical services. A Strategy Taskforce was established to guide this effort. In July 2024, an interim executive director was appointed, marking the first leadership change since 2010, alongside the hiring of FirstRule Group (FRG) to assess WA 211 operations comprehensively. The assessment aimed to provide recommendations for a redesigned, sustainable business model that would enhance service delivery and respond effectively to evolving public safety and health needs, as well as economic and community crises. FRG conducted over sixty stakeholder interviews, engaging staff, clients from seven regional contact centers, government agencies, and community partners. Additionally, a three-day design workshop was organized to identify WA 211’s strengths, weaknesses, challenges, and opportunities, ensuring the organization can better serve its communities.
