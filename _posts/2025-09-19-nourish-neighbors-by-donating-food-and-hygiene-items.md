The City of Bellevue, in collaboration with local partners, is launching the “Essentials for All” drive from Oct. 1 to Nov. 15 to collect food and hygiene products. This initiative addresses the critical issue of food insecurity, affecting about one in four school-age children in Bellevue, which jeopardizes their health and academic success. Collection points will be established at various locations, including community centers and City Hall. City Manager Diane Carlson emphasizes the importance of community support, stating that the drive allows neighbors to help one another. At the end of the collection period, donated items will be distributed to local food banks and nonprofits, ensuring they reach those in need. Additionally, residents can contribute to the Human Services Fund to assist community members in accessing essential services. Participating organizations include Africans on the Eastside, Catholic Community Services, Hopelink, the Salvation Army, and many others, all working together to support the Bellevue community.
