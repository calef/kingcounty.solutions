Husky Health Center and ASUW are hosting Test Fest, a free event for all University of Washington Seattle campus students, offering free STI tests from November 4th to 18th, 2025. With over 70% of chlamydia and gonorrhea cases going undetected, this initiative encourages students to get tested before symptoms appear. The event takes place at the Husky Health Center, and participation is open to currently enrolled students. To participate, students must sign up online, as walk-ins will not be accepted. Testing involves a simple procedure of either a swab or a urine sample to check for gonorrhea and chlamydia. Those experiencing symptoms should contact the Husky Health Center directly at 206.685.1011 to schedule a treatment appointment. The event is funded by ASUW in collaboration with the Husky Health Center.
