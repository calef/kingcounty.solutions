San Francisco has inaugurated The Kelsey Civic Center, a landmark community focused on accessibility and inclusivity, developed by The Kelsey and Mercy Housing California. This $88.3 million project features 112 affordable apartments for individuals earning 20% to 60% of the area median income, with 25% of units designated for people with disabilities utilizing Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS). Notably, it represents the first housing lottery in San Francisco that prioritizes HCBS users. The ground floor houses the nation's first publicly funded Disability Cultural Center.

The building emphasizes sustainability with all-electric systems, energy-efficient design, and a courtyard garden that enhances biodiversity. Amenities include a roof deck, community workspaces, and services aimed at fostering resident connections. The Kelsey Civic Center was built using Inclusive Design Standards, promoting access for diverse needs. It aims to serve as a model for future inclusive housing policies, demonstrating that accessible, beautiful, and sustainable homes are achievable even in challenging markets. City officials and community leaders celebrated this development as a significant step toward creating a more inclusive society, with ongoing support from Mercy Housing Management Group.
