Seattle police have arrested a 17-year-old boy for assaulting an 80-year-old man who confronted him while he was graffitiing the Ballard Bridge. The incident occurred on Nov. 17, when the elderly victim, noticing four teenagers spray painting nearby, attempted to record the act on his phone. As he filmed, two suspects moved to the bridge and began tagging it. One of the teens attacked the man, punching him multiple times, resulting in a shoulder injury and a cut to his lip. After the assault, the suspects fled the scene. The victim's family shared the video online to seek help in identifying the attackers. A community member recognized the suspects via Nextdoor, leading detectives from the Seattle Police Department’s Criminal Intelligence Unit to identify and locate the 17-year-old. He was arrested at a local high school on Nov. 20 and was found to have prior law enforcement interactions. Although the graffiti damage was assessed at $1,110 and the city has since repaired it, the suspect was released to his parent without booking. The investigation is ongoing, with detectives having recovered five spray paint cans as evidence.
