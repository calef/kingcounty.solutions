  <p><strong>OLYMPIA</strong> -- The Washington State Department of Health has revoked or suspended the licenses, certifications, or registrations of the following health care providers in our state. The department has also immediately suspended the credentials of people who have been prohibited from practicing in other states.</p>

  <p>The department’s Health Systems Quality Assurance Division works with boards, commissions and advisory committees to set licensing standards for more than 80 health care professions (e.g., dentists, nurses, counselors). Information about disciplinary action taken against medical doctors and physician assistants can be found on the <a href="http://www.wmc.wa.gov/">Washington Medical Commission (WMC) website</a>. Questions about WMC disciplinary actions can be sent to <a href="mailto:media@wmc.wa.gov">media@wmc.wa.gov</a>.</p>

  <p>Information about health care providers is on the agency’s website. <a name="_Hlk128486923">Click on “</a><a href="https://doh.wa.gov/licenses-permits-and-certificates/provider-credential-search">Health Care Provider Lookup</a>” under the “Find it Fast” section of the <a href="http://www.doh.wa.gov/Home.aspx">Department of Health website</a> (doh.wa.gov).

Notable cases include Wendy Amelia Kurinzi and Constance M. Morris, both suspended for abuse, and others facing similar actions across various counties. Some providers are barred from practicing due to being placed on the long-term care abuse and neglect registry.
