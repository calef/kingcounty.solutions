Bank of America’s Neighborhood Builders program is enhancing nonprofit leadership and providing multiyear funding to organizations that impact communities. In 2025, two nonprofits in Atlanta will each receive a $200,000 grant over two years to expand a Behavioral Health Navigation program focused on senior residents. This initiative includes leadership training for each organization’s executive director and an emerging leader, along with access to a national nonprofit network. Since its inception in 2004, the Neighborhood Builders program has invested over $346 million in U.S. communities and trained more than 4,000 leaders across nearly 2,000 nonprofits. This funding aims to address critical issues related to economic opportunity and strengthen community foundations.
