Members of the Cancer Lifeline team recently participated in the Cancer Survivorship Celebration organized by the South Puget Intertribal Planning Agency (SPIPA). This two-day event celebrated Indigenous cancer survivors, emphasizing joy, remembrance, and community resilience. It highlighted the challenges of late diagnoses, health disparities, and systemic inequities faced by Indigenous peoples. Attendees shared powerful stories of courage and cultural strength, fostering a sense of relational healing through communal gatherings. 

Cancer Lifeline is dedicated to providing culturally respectful support for those affected by cancer, viewing survivorship as a collective journey. During the event, staff led various sessions, including a Healing Circle facilitated by Deputy Director Cheryl Sesnon, where participants explored themes of grief and remembrance. Melissa Layer, LMFT, focused on mental health and resilience through gratitude, while Victrinia Ridgeway guided participants in writing letters to their future selves, which will be mailed in Fall 2025. A resource table was also available throughout the event, reinforcing the commitment to support and community. The experience underscored the importance of listening, learning, and caring in their ongoing mission.
