  <p>On December 3, we are doing something different. Instead of gathering in a hotel ballroom, we invite you—YouthCare’s community—to come home to the Orion Center.</p>



  <p>Since 1984, Orion has been a beacon of hope – a safe place for youth ages 12–24, offering warm meals, showers, clean clothes, lockers, drop-in activities, case management, mental health care, and shelter. At a time when sustaining these essential services is under significant strain, there is no more meaningful place to celebrate our roots, reconnect with our mission, and lean into what makes YouthCare, so incredible special.</p>



  <p>For 41 years, the iconic green building has been more than just a building—it has been a place of safety, belonging, and opportunity for thousands of young people. On this night, we’ll gather in its heart to share company with one another, to answer the call to be part of the solution, and to raise our paddles in support of young people experiencing homelessness.</p>



  <p>Together, we can rise-up and ensure that youth across King County have the foundation, stability, and security they deserve—right now, and always, no matter what.</p>
