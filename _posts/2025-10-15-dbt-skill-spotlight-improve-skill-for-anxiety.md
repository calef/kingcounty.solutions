Anxiety can be overwhelming, disrupting daily life with constant worry, panic attacks, and physical symptoms. Learning to manage anxiety is crucial, especially since avoiding triggers isn't feasible. The IMPROVE skill from Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is a valuable tool for coping with anxiety when it feels unbearable. Each letter in IMPROVE represents a strategy to create space, soothe the nervous system, and shift perspective.

- **Imagery**: Visualize a safe, relaxing place in detail.
- **Meaning**: Find comfort or wisdom in suffering, possibly through artistic expression or connection with others.
- **Prayer**: Engage in meditation, mantras, or reflection on your place in the universe to alleviate distress.
- **Relaxation**: Identify and practice activities that help you relax.
- **One thing**: Focus on a single aspect of your current experience to cultivate mindfulness.
- **Vacation**: Take short breaks from stressors, like a walk or a coffee break.
- **Encouragement**: Counter negative self-beliefs with positive affirmations.

THIRA Health provides DBT skills to help reduce anxiety's impact, offering a holistic approach to mental health through various supportive therapies.
