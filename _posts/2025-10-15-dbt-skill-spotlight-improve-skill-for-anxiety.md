  <h2 class="p4">How to Use IMPROVE for Anxiety</h2>
  <h3 class="p5"><i>Imagery</i></h3>
  <p class="p6"><span class="s1"><a href="https://dbtselfhelp.com/improve-the-moment/">Use your imagination</a></span> and think of a safe, beautiful place. Picture yourself there in detail, relaxing and enjoying the moment. Indoors, outdoors, a place you know, or a place you create just for you. You can imagine yourself alone, or with people who feel safe.</p>
  <p class="p8">Notice the details; how would this place smell, how would the textures feel, what would you see, and what soothing sounds could you hear while in this place? Relax into the imagery; if you notice your mind wandering back to anxious thoughts, gently redirect your attention back to the imagery you create for yourself.</p>
  <h3 class="p5"><i>Find meaning</i></h3>
  <p class="p6">If it feels comforting, <a href="https://dbt.tools/distress_tolerance/improve.php"><span class="s1">look for meaning</span></a> in your current distress. Some people find comfort in knowing that suffering can lead to wisdom or maturity. Some people transmute their suffering into artistic expression. Others may find that connecting to others through sharing their suffering and receiving comfort, or helping others know they’re not alone, adds meaning to their experience.</p>
  <p class="p8">Is there a silver lining to what you’re going through? Is there a deeper meaning you can find that can make this current moment easier to bear?</p>
  <h3 class="p5"><i>Prayer</i></h3>
  <p class="p8"><span class="s1"><a href="https://dbtselfhelp.com/improve-the-moment/">Whether</a></span> you believe in a supreme being/beings, the greater power of the universe, or even the power of your own Wise Mind, connecting to this presence in your life through prayer can reduce distress. When anxiety is making it hard to function, meditation, repeated phrases or mantras, sharing your distress, asking for strength, or spending time considering your place in the universe can all help turn down the volume on anxiety in the moment.</p>
  <h3 class="p5"><i>Relaxation</i></h3>
  <p class="p8">You know what activities help you relax; which of them can you do in this moment? Whether it’s a warm mug of tea, stretching at your desk, your favorite music in your car, a warm bath at home, or whatever helps you relax, when anxiety is interfering with the moment, countering it with a little self-care can help.</p>
  <h3 class="p5"><i>One thing</i></h3>
  <p class="p8"><span class="s1"><a href="https://dbt.tools/distress_tolerance/improve.php">When</a></span> you’re in the grips of a panic attack at your work desk, or anxiety has you awake and frantic at 2 in the morning, choose one thing in the moment you are doing (sitting in a chair, lying with your head on a pillow, typing on a keyboard) and focus all of your attention on that one thing. Return your attention to that one thing over and over, creating a moment of mindfulness and perspective when your anxiety is trying to demand all of your attention.</p>
  <h3 class="p5"><i>Vacation</i></h3>
  <p class="p8">Take a break from life’s demands. Go for a walk. Take a study break and listen to your favorite music or podcast for 15 minutes (set a timer so you don’t get derailed by escapism). Drive to your favorite coffee shop and sit and enjoy a cup at a table. Book an actual vacation if you can!</p>
  <h3 class="p5"><i>Encouragement</i></h3>

Anxiety can be overwhelming, disrupting daily life with constant worry, panic attacks, and physical symptoms. Learning to manage anxiety is crucial, especially since avoiding triggers isn't feasible. The IMPROVE skill from Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is a valuable tool for coping with anxiety when it feels unbearable. Each letter in IMPROVE represents a strategy to create space, soothe the nervous system, and shift perspective.

- **Imagery**: Visualize a safe, relaxing place in detail.
- **Meaning**: Find comfort or wisdom in suffering, possibly through artistic expression or connection with others.
- **Prayer**: Engage in meditation, mantras, or reflection on your place in the universe to alleviate distress.
- **Relaxation**: Identify and practice activities that help you relax.
- **One thing**: Focus on a single aspect of your current experience to cultivate mindfulness.
- **Vacation**: Take short breaks from stressors, such as a walk or a coffee break.
- **Encouragement**: Counter negative self-beliefs with positive affirmations.

THIRA Health provides DBT skills to help reduce anxiety's impact, offering a holistic approach to mental health through various supportive therapies.
