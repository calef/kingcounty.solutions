Seattle police are investigating a shooting that occurred in the Rainier Vista neighborhood on November 18, 2025, which left a 17-year-old boy seriously injured. At approximately 7:10 p.m., officers responded to reports of gunfire at 30th Avenue South and South Adams Street and found the teen with gunshot wounds to his back. He received medical aid from police until Seattle Fire Department medics arrived, who then transported him to Harborview Medical Center in serious condition.

Upon further investigation, detectives from the Gun Violence Reduction Unit and the Robbery Unit discovered that the injured teen was wanted for unrelated robbery charges. Consequently, he was placed in custody while under hospital guard. The circumstances leading up to the shooting are still under investigation, and authorities are seeking information from the public, urging anyone with details to contact the Seattle Police Department’s Violent Crimes Tip Line.
