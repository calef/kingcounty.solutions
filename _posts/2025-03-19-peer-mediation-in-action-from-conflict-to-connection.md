The Peer Mediation program has made significant strides this year, enhancing student engagement and conflict resolution within the school community. Students have developed essential skills through training sessions focusing on negotiation techniques and effective questioning, learning the importance of understanding underlying needs through interactive stories, such as the classic "orange story." This approach emphasizes uncovering root causes to create win-win solutions.

Engagement in peer mediation has increased at Showalter Middle School, with all participants involved in multiple mediations, leading to reconciliations among students. The rise in referrals is attributed to improved coordination with school administrators and the active presence of mediation staff, making mediation a trusted resource. Students value the program for fostering leadership skills and a positive school culture, expressing a desire for a welcoming mediation environment.

As the program enters a new grant cycle, there is a commitment to expand conflict resolution offerings, including relationship skills workshops. Feedback from students and parents highlights the effectiveness of peer mediation in navigating conflicts. The program's success relies on the dedication of peer mediators, school staff, and community supporters, paving the way for future developments and enhancements.
