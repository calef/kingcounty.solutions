New research emphasizes the pressing issue of hygiene poverty in Washington State, as highlighted in the paper “Access to Dignity: Policy and Advocacy Opportunities for Ending Hygiene Poverty.” The study reveals that access to essential hygiene products—such as soap, toothpaste, diapers, menstrual supplies, and cleaning items—represents a significant and often overlooked form of deprivation for low-income households. The authors provide several recommendations to address this issue, derived from a comprehensive analysis of existing policies and interviews. Key policy recommendations include exempting hygiene products from sales tax, allowing SNAP/WIC funds for hygiene purchases, creating hygiene benefits for TANF, Medicaid, and CHIP recipients, and ensuring access to hygiene products in state-run correctional facilities. Additionally, advocacy strategies are proposed, such as enhancing the internal capacity of Essentials First, refining messaging about hygiene poverty, and expanding the Essential Needs Coalition's influence. These initiatives form a comprehensive plan aimed at improving hygiene access across the state. Essentials First and the Essential Needs Coalition plan to further explore these findings and advocate for solutions to hygiene poverty in the months ahead, aiming for lasting improvements for affected communities.
