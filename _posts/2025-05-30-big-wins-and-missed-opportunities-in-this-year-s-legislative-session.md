  As is often the case, this year’s legislative session in Olympia ended up being a mixed bag for families living on low incomes in Washington state.

  On one hand, lawmakers passed a historic rent stabilization bill and avoided the worst potential cuts to services while working to overcome a $16 billion deficit. On the other hand, the legislature still made $5.9 billion in cuts to services that Washington residents rely on, halved Medicaid Dental reimbursement rates, and missed an opportunity to help address our state’s regressive tax structure by implementing a new wealth tax.&nbsp;

  In the end, the legislature and governor disproportionately placed the burden of balancing the budget on families who are already struggling – but not to the extent that we feared.&nbsp;

This year's legislative session in Olympia resulted in mixed outcomes for low-income families in Washington state. Lawmakers successfully passed a historic rent stabilization bill and avoided the most severe cuts to services while addressing a $16 billion budget deficit. However, the legislature still enacted $5.9 billion in cuts to essential services, reduced Medicaid Dental reimbursement rates by half, and failed to implement a new wealth tax that could have addressed the state's regressive tax structure. Ultimately, the burden of budget balancing fell disproportionately on struggling families, though not as severely as initially feared. The session highlights both significant achievements and missed opportunities in addressing the needs of vulnerable populations in the state.
