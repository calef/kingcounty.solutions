Bellevue’s summer Neighborhood Walks series is returning for its ninth year, offering residents a chance to engage with city staff and discuss neighborhood issues. Scheduled for July 10, 23, and 24, the walks will take place in the BelRed Arts District, Cougar Mountain/Lakemont, and Eastgate areas, respectively. Each walk lasts about 90 minutes and covers approximately 1.5 miles. Community members are encouraged to join, even if they do not plan to walk the route, to meet neighbors and staff at the starting points.

The BelRed Arts District walk will occur on July 10 from 6:30 to 8 p.m., starting at BelRed Station. The Eastgate Area walk is set for July 23, while the Cougar Mountain/Lakemont walk will take place on July 24. The latter will include limited Mandarin interpretation. Participants can connect with the city to share insights about their neighborhoods and contribute to ongoing community dialogue.
