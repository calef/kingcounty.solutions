title: Bellevue to evaluate installing new speed safety cameras
topics: []
---

The City of Bellevue is planning to expand its use of speed safety cameras to enhance traffic safety, in accordance with new state legislation. The initiative aims to address speeding, a leading cause of fatal and serious crashes, and supports Bellevue's Vision Zero goal to eliminate severe accidents by 2030. Since 2009, speed safety cameras have been operational in specific school zones and intersections. The updated state law permits the installation of cameras in additional high-risk areas, including near parks and hospitals.

Transportation planners will analyze crash data and community input to propose new camera locations to the City Council by late 2025, with installation expected to start in mid-2026. A Speed Safety Camera Program Operations Guide, developed with a federal grant, will outline key components such as camera siting criteria and fine structures, ensuring the program is data-driven and community-informed.

To promote fairness, the law includes measures such as not capturing images of drivers or passengers, offering fine reductions for low-income owners, and mandating that revenue be reinvested in traffic safety enhancements. Community engagement is encouraged through upcoming events and a feedback questionnaire available on the city's platform.
