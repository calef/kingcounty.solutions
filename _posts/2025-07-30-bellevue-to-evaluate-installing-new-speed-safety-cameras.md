  Council will consider additional camera locations in late 2025

  The City of Bellevue is advancing efforts to improve traffic safety by expanding its use of speed safety cameras, in alignment with new state legislation that allows for broader use. Transportation planners will consider crash data and community input before recommending any new locations for cameras to the City Council.

  Speeding is one of the top factors for fatal and serious crashes in Bellevue. The expanded use of speed safety cameras supports achieving the city's Vision Zero goal of eliminating severe crashes by 2030.

  Speed safety cameras, which detect and record speeding vehicles, have been in use in Bellevue since 2009. They currently operate in three school zones and at four major intersections to enforce red-light violations. Now, under updated state law ([RCW 46.63.250](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=46.63.250)), the city is authorized to install cameras in additional high-risk areas, including near public parks, hospitals, school walk zones and areas with a history of crashes.

  “Crash data and community feedback consistently point to speeding as a serious concern,” said Transportation Director Andrew Singelakis. “We know that speed directly affects the severity of injuries when crashes happen. Speed safety cameras, along with thoughtful street design and other Safe System strategies, are key to creating safer streets where no one is killed or seriously injured in a crash.”

  As part of the expansion, the city is developing a Speed Safety Camera Program Operations Guide. Supported by a federal Safe Streets and Roads for All grant, a cross-departmental team is working to ensure the guide is data-driven, community-informed and aligned with national best practices. The guide will define key program components such as camera siting criteria, fine structures, revenue requirements and long-term program management.

  The state law also includes several safeguards to promote fairness and accountability:

  - Cameras may not capture images of drivers or passengers.
  - Fine reductions are available for qualifying low-income vehicle owners.
  - All revenue must be reinvested into traffic safety improvements.
  - Equity analysis is required to ensure cameras are equitably distributed and that a proportionate share of investments flow to low-income neighborhoods and to corridors with a history of speed-related crashes.

  Following completion of the operations guide, the city will take a phased approach to implementation. The City Council will receive a list of candidate camera locations by the end of 2025, with installations expected to begin in mid-2026.

title: Bellevue to evaluate installing new speed safety cameras
topics: []

The City of Bellevue is planning to expand its use of speed safety cameras to enhance traffic safety, in accordance with new state legislation. The initiative aims to address speeding, a leading cause of fatal and serious crashes, and supports Bellevue's Vision Zero goal to eliminate severe accidents by 2030. Since 2009, speed safety cameras have been operational in specific school zones and intersections. The updated state law permits the installation of cameras in additional high-risk areas, including near parks and hospitals.

Transportation planners will analyze crash data and community input to propose new camera locations to the City Council by late 2025, with installation expected to start in mid-2026. A Speed Safety Camera Program Operations Guide, developed with a federal grant, will outline key components such as camera siting criteria and fine structures, ensuring the program is data-driven and community-informed.

To promote fairness, the law includes measures such as not capturing images of drivers or passengers, offering fine reductions for low-income owners, and mandating that revenue be reinvested in traffic safety enhancements. Community engagement is encouraged through upcoming events and a feedback questionnaire available on the city's platform.
