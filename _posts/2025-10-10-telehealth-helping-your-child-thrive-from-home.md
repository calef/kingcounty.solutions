Encompass Pediatric Therapy promotes telehealth as an effective method for child therapy, particularly when barriers such as illness, bad weather, or tight schedules prevent in-person sessions. The blog post details three types of telehealth sessions: Child + Clinician, Parent Coaching, and Parent-Only sessions, each catering to different needs. It emphasizes that telehealth can lead to significant progress as it takes place in real-life environments where children live and play. Parents' involvement in therapy sessions can lead to quicker progress and increased confidence. The blog also provides tips for a smooth telehealth session and shares positive feedback from families.
