Founded in 2017, the yəhaw̓ Indigenous Creatives Collective is an intertribal community of Indigenous artists focused on enhancing mental and emotional health through art and community engagement. Initially a pop-up art project, it has evolved into a hub for Indigenous creatives, facilitating connections with each other and the land. Recently, yəhaw̓ collaborated with the Seattle Office of Arts and Culture for an exhibition at King Street Station, showcasing over 200 Indigenous artists and demonstrating the community’s need for a Native-owned gathering space. This led to the purchase of a 1.5-acre parcel in South King County and a 1,270 square foot home to serve as an arts and community center. Supported by a Food Equity Fund grant, yəhaw̓ is working on restoring a greenhouse and expanding green space in Rainier Beach while engaging local Indigenous and BIPOC communities in land restoration and cultural programming. The Seattle Department of Neighborhoods is actively partnering with yəhaw̓ to support their initiatives and learn more about their work. The collective hosts weekly open house volunteer days for public participation and engagement in their ongoing projects.
