King County residents, including renters, homeowners, nonprofits, and businesses impacted by the November bomb cyclone, may qualify for low-interest federal disaster loans through the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). To apply, individuals can visit SBA.gov/disaster for online applications or receive in-person assistance at Disaster Loan Outreach Centers starting January 6, located at Bellevue Library and King County Elections in Renton. Essential information for loan applications includes the damaged property's name and address, contact details for applicants, Social Security numbers, insurance policy details, and lease agreements for renters. For assistance, applicants can contact the SBA Customer Service Center at 800–659–2955 or email disastercustomerservice@sba.gov. Individuals with hearing impairments can use telecommunications relay services by dialing 711. The application deadlines are February 21, 2025, for property damage and September 23, 2025, for economic injury.
