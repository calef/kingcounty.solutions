  “The CETCAP program was key in understanding the documentation that is needed for
  submission and maintain clear records to make filing easier.” – David Reedy, Sustainability
  Coordinator\n\n## Project overview\n\nThe City of Issaquah, a small local government
  with approximately 282 employees, is located 17 miles south of Seattle. The city
  engaged the CETCAP team to explore energy tax credits through elective pay, aiming
  to secure funding for eight electric vehicles scheduled to be placed into service
  by December 2024.\n\n## Technical assistance provided\n\nWith the help of L4GG and
  filing partner Giraffe Financial, the City of Issaquah was able to file for $52,200
  — 12% of the total project cost. The city was able to qualify for the Internal Revenue
  45W: commercial clean vehicle credit for four Ford Lightnings, two Chevy Blazers,
  and one Ford E-Transit.\n\nLegal partner Avisen also assisted Issaquah with technical
  guidance in early 2025 prior to filing. With funding support sourced from Puget
  Sound Energy, the Washington State Department of Commerce, and King County, the
  city was able to make notable strides toward installing EV chargers.\n\n## Outcomes
  and impact\n\nThe elective pay provision has sparked discussions about expanding
  the City’s EV fleet, installing charging stations, and developing solar projects.
  The city plans to submit more applications for these initiatives in 2026.\n\n> “The
  city noted that after EVs were placed in service, staff was highly satisfied with
  their capabilities and comfort.”\n> \n> – Local public official\n\n## Washington
  Clean Energy Tax Credit Assistance Program (CETCAP)\n\nIn partnership with Lawyers
  for Good Government and Giraffe Financial, the Washington Clean Energy Tax Credit
  Assistance Program (CETCAP) team has helped more than 150 organizations statewide
  secure hundreds of thousands of dollars in tax credits by providing legal and filing
  assistance for hundreds of projects.\n\n![Lawyers for Good Government logo](https://www.commerce.wa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/l4gg-color.png)\n\n![Giraffe
