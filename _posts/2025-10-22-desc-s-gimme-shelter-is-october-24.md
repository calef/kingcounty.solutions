DESC's annual benefit concert, Gimme Shelter, will be held on October 24 from 6-10 p.m. at the Georgetown Ballroom in Seattle. The event aims to raise awareness and funds for efforts to end homelessness in the region, featuring local live music and community engagement. The evening will begin with a free Program Spotlight on the STAR Center, a behavioral health-focused shelter that offers support for individuals on their recovery journey, including access to psychiatric care and enrollment specialists. Following the program, attendees can enjoy a concert by local band Billy Joe & the Dusty 45s, with special guest Danny Godinez. The concert requires a ticket purchase, with proceeds benefiting DESC's housing, healthcare, and crisis response initiatives. The schedule includes a reception with appetizers for Program Spotlight attendees, the spotlight presentation, and the concert. While a ticket is required for the concert, attendees are encouraged to make a minimum donation of $250 to support DESC’s work across King County.
