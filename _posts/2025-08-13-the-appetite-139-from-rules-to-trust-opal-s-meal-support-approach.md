In the latest episode of "The Appetite," Opal Co-Founders Julie Church, RDN, and Lexi Giblin, PhD, share their innovative approach to therapeutic meal support, which integrates radically open dialectical behavior therapy (RO-DBT). This method emphasizes trust, connection, and emotional openness over rigid dietary rules, creating a supportive environment for clients recovering from eating disorders. The Opal team has shifted from traditional meal support, which often led to clients refusing food, to a more flexible framework that encourages emotional expression during meals. They promote a playful atmosphere, allowing clients to engage in authentic conversations about food and life, fostering community and connection. This new approach aims to decrease feelings of loneliness and enhance clients' ability to nourish themselves. By holding clients accountable to their meal plans while allowing emotional discomfort, Opal helps clients recognize their capacity for recovery. The results have been promising, with clients more consistently completing their meals and experiencing a renewed sense of connection to their bodies and appetites, ultimately fostering a healthier relationship with food and self. The episode highlights how these changes have transformed Opal into a thriving eating community, supporting clients in their recovery journeys.
