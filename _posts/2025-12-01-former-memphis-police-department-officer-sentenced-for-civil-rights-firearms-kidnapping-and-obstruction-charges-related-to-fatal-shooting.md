A former Memphis police officer, 32-year-old Darrell Eugene Smith, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for civil rights violations, including kidnapping and using a firearm during a violent crime. Smith was convicted for his role in an incident on March 15, 2018, where he and another officer unlawfully detained three individuals, using their police authority to conduct an illegal search and seizure. During the incident, Smith threatened the victims with a firearm and physically assaulted them. The Justice Department emphasized the importance of holding law enforcement accountable for violating citizens' rights. Following his prison term, Smith will be under supervised release for three years. The case highlights ongoing efforts to address misconduct within law enforcement agencies and uphold civil rights protections.
