  ## A Sleep Study with Renewed Energy

  Part of our Young Professionals Advisory Council since its inception, Todd Obilor has been volunteering and raising awareness for Atlantic Street Center for almost three years now. He is currently working towards his PhD in&nbsp;child clinical psychology, specifically in how sleep (or lack thereof) can be impacted by societal prejudices and racism.

  Todd recently collaborated with our Youth Development team to interview young people in our program for a study. Through careful interviews in person and virtually, our youth were able to give Todd more insight into how they process their surroundings and how it may affect their sleep.

  Having young professionals who are passionate about their own ambitions, as well as the potential of their community, is a steadfast way to keep Atlantic Street Center pointed towards the future. Also, Todd represents another amazing adult our kids can look up to. Thank you, Todd!
