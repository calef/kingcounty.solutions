Westside Neighbors Shelter is seeking community support to provide a Thanksgiving dinner for 40 men and women currently sheltering at the American Legion Hall. Volunteers are needed to prepare dishes such as stuffing, mashed potatoes, and turkey, as well as to donate pies. Additionally, help is requested for serving the dinner on Thursday night. Those interested in contributing can reach out to Cinda Stegner via email.
