The Seattle Home Fair 2025 has launched its learning sessions, now available online. These sessions aim to provide valuable information and resources for residents interested in homeownership, housing stability, and community engagement. Participants will have the opportunity to attend a variety of workshops led by experts in the field. Topics include home buying, financial assistance programs, and sustainable living practices. The sessions are designed to cater to a diverse audience, including first-time homebuyers and those looking to improve their housing situations. Registration for the sessions is open, and residents are encouraged to take advantage of this opportunity to enhance their knowledge and skills related to housing. The initiative supports Seattle's commitment to making housing more accessible and fostering a stronger community through informed homeownership.
