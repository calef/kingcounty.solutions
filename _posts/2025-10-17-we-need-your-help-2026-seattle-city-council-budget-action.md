LIHI and other nonprofit housing providers are urging the Seattle City Council to allocate an additional $10 million for tenant-based rental assistance in the 2026 budget. Many tenants in affordable housing, funded by the Office of Housing, are struggling with rising living costs, including essentials like food and healthcare. This financial strain can lead to difficult choices, such as deciding between paying rent and providing for their families. Without sufficient rental assistance, low-income tenants risk becoming homeless. The proposed funding is specifically aimed at residents living in housing supported by the Office of Housing. Community members are encouraged to contact the Seattle City Council to advocate for this crucial funding. Individuals can express their support by emailing all nine Councilmembers to request that $10 million be added to the Human Services Department budget for tenant-based rental assistance targeted at OH-funded properties.
