  We have two new Bilingual Legal Services Coordinators on the ELAP team!

  **Bianca Reynaga** (she/her), joined ELAP in June. She previously worked at the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services.

  **Deyanira Armenta Gonzalez** (she/her), is the newest member of our team and has experience as a Domestic Violence Case Manager for Consejo Counseling & Referral Services.

  In this role, Bianca and Deyanira will be responsible for managing all intakes and referrals for clients who speak Spanish as their primary language and using our interpreter service to assist clients who are non-native English speakers.

  Our Bilingual Legal Services Coordinators also act as the main point of contact for our community partners that work with populations with language access needs and will help with case management tasks, such as obtaining client documents, sending out appointment reminders and client surveys, and entering attorney case notes into the legal database.
