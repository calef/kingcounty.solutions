  We are unable to meet the current demand in our family law clinics. Help us fill these critical slots by signing up to be a pro bono attorney!

  Commitment is typically 1-3 hours per month. Family law clinics are held virtually, so you can volunteer easily from your home or office.

  ELAP staff provide on-boarding and ongoing practical support.

  When you volunteer with ELAP, you are making a difference in King County by providing free legal aid to people who can’t afford a lawyer.

ELAP (Eastside Legal Assistance Program) is facing a high demand for family law attorneys and is unable to meet the current need in its virtual family law clinics. The organization is calling for pro bono attorneys to volunteer one to three hours per month from their home or office. ELAP provides onboarding and ongoing support to volunteers. By volunteering, attorneys would be providing free legal aid to those in King County who cannot afford a lawyer. Those interested in volunteering can sign up on the ELAP website.
