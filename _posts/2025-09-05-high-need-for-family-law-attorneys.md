ELAP (Eastside Legal Assistance Program) is facing a high demand for family law attorneys and is unable to meet the current need in its virtual family law clinics. The organization is calling for pro bono attorneys to volunteer 1-3 hours per month from their home or office. ELAP provides on-boarding and ongoing support to volunteers. By volunteering, attorneys would be providing free legal aid to those in King County who cannot afford a lawyer. Those interested in volunteering can sign up on the ELAP website.
