Metro is making several service adjustments for the weekend of Nov. 26-30, 2025. Key changes include modifications to routes and schedules to accommodate holiday travel. Riders are encouraged to check their routes for specific service alterations, especially for the Thanksgiving holiday period.

On Friday, Nov. 28, most Metro routes will operate on a regular schedule, while some routes may see increased service to handle the holiday crowds. Saturday, Nov. 29, will feature a mix of regular and modified schedules, with some routes experiencing reduced frequency. Sunday, Nov. 30, will see a return to normal service levels for most routes.

Metro also reminds passengers to stay informed about potential delays or changes due to weather conditions or events occurring over the weekend. As always, riders are urged to plan their trips in advance and utilize Metro's real-time tracking tools for the latest updates.

Additional information regarding specific routes and schedules is available through Metro's communication channels. Passengers are encouraged to travel safely and enjoy the holiday weekend with family and friends.
