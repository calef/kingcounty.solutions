Metro's weekend update for November 26-30, 2025, highlights service changes and important information for riders. On November 27, Metro routes will operate on a Sunday schedule for the Thanksgiving holiday, with specific adjustments to some bus routes. Regular service resumes on November 28, but delays may occur due to holiday traffic. 

Metro encourages riders to check their routes ahead of time for any potential service changes. The Sound Transit Link light rail service will operate on a modified schedule as well, with extended hours for certain lines on November 27 to accommodate holiday travel. 

On November 29, the Metro will provide free rides on all services as part of Small Business Saturday, promoting local shopping and encouraging the community to explore nearby businesses. Riders are reminded to wear masks while on public transit and to maintain social distancing where possible. 

Additional details on specific bus routes and schedules are available on the Metro website. Riders are encouraged to plan their trips in advance to ensure a smooth travel experience over the holiday weekend.
