  <p><strong>CENTRAL POINT, OR July 28, 2025</strong>—&nbsp;A groundbreaking partnership between Dogs for Better Lives (DBL) and Angel Flight West is streamlining the journey for puppies and future Service Dogs, bringing efficiency and compassion to every step of their path toward service. This collaboration ensures that transportation is not just practical but also safe and timely, allowing DBL to focus more resources on training and placing life-changing Service Dogs.</p>



  <p><strong>In celebration of this partnership, DBL has named one of its newest puppies-in-training “Jet” — a tribute to Angel Flight West and its incredible network of volunteer pilots.</strong>&nbsp;Born on May 30 to breeder dog Lili, Jet is already soaring toward his future as a life-changing Service Dog.</p>



  <p>Angel Flight West helps facilitate transportation of puppies and dogs along the west coast. Flights include puppies heading to or from their volunteer Puppy Raisers, future Service Dogs turning in for professional training to DBL’s West Campus, and Service Dogs and their Field Representatives heading out to placement. This is a welcome expansion to DBL’s growing Canine Co-Pilots program.</p>



  <p>The first flight of this partnership took off in January of this year, transporting future Service Dog Chance from DBL’s West Campus in Oregon to his volunteer Puppy Raiser in Bozeman, Montana. Since then, Angel Flight West has flown multiple DBL dogs and puppies across the Western U.S., helping the organization save time and resources to get their dogs where they need to go — safely and efficiently.</p>



  <p>“Partnering with Angel Flight West is a game-changer for us,” said Bryan Williams, CEO of Dogs for Better Lives. “Their incredible network of volunteer pilots allows us to save time and resources while ensuring that puppies and future Service Dogs can transition through each stage of their journey quickly and safely. This partnership reflects our shared commitment to improving lives and supporting communities.”</p>



  <p>Angel Flight West, a nonprofit dedicated to delivering health and hope through donated flights, provides these services at no cost to DBL, just as they do for their healthcare passengers. Their network of over 1,800 volunteer pilots completes thousands of missions annually, showcasing the profound impact of compassion in the skies.</p>



  <p>&#8220;We’re proud to partner with organizations like Dogs for Better Lives to help service dogs on their journeys to and from training,” says AFW Associate Executive Director Cheri Cimmarrusti. “We know it makes a profound impact on individuals and families when a service dog is partnered with a companion, and we’re deeply grateful to our volunteer pilots who make these life-changing flights possible.&#8221;</p>
