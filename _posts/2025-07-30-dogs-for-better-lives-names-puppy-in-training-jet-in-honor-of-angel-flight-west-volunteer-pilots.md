Dogs for Better Lives (DBL) has named a new puppy-in-training “Jet” to honor the volunteer pilots of Angel Flight West (AFW). This collaboration aims to streamline the transportation of puppies and future Service Dogs, ensuring safe and timely travel, which allows DBL to allocate more resources toward training. Jet was born on May 30 and is part of DBL's efforts to place life-changing Service Dogs. AFW facilitates the transportation of dogs across the western United States, including puppies heading to volunteer Puppy Raisers, Service Dogs going for training, and those being placed with families. Since the partnership began in January, multiple flights have been completed, significantly aiding DBL in their mission. Bryan Williams, CEO of DBL, emphasized the positive impact of this partnership on their operations. AFW operates with over 1,800 volunteer pilots who provide flights at no cost, showcasing the importance of compassion in their services. Cheri Cimmarrusti, Associate Executive Director of AFW, highlighted the difference service dogs make in people's lives, expressing gratitude for the dedication of their volunteer pilots. This partnership exemplifies a shared commitment to improving lives and supporting communities through effective collaboration.
