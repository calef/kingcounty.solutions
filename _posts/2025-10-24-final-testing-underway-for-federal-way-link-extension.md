The Federal Way Link Extension is nearing completion, with final testing involving simulated service scheduled every eight to 15 minutes from Angle Lake to the Federal Way Downtown Station, including stops at Kent Des Moines and Star Lake. This testing ensures all systems function properly before the official opening on December 6, which will start at 11 a.m. The extension includes over 3,000 parking stalls and bike storage at all new stations. Following the extension's opening and the 2026 World Cup, ST Express bus service will be updated, with feedback from riders being collected through a survey until November 7.
