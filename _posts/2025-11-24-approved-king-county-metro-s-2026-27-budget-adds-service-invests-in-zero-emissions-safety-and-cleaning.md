The King County Council has approved Metro’s budget for 2026-2027, totaling $4 billion. This budget allocates over 400,000 additional hours for bus service and emphasizes safety, cleaning, and zero-emissions initiatives. Key features include connecting riders to new Sound Transit Link light rail stations and enhancing service frequency. The RapidRide network will expand with the opening of the RapidRide I Line and J Line, along with plans for the R Line and K Line.

The budget also invests in Access Paratransit, Dial-a-Ride Transit, and the King County Water Taxi, with new pilot zones for Metro Flex in Auburn and Federal Way. Safety measures will be improved through the SaFE Reform initiative, including expanded staffing for Metro Transit Police. Additionally, funding ensures frequent cleaning of buses and high-priority stops.

To address environmental concerns, the budget supports the development of the Tukwila bus base, aimed at zero-emission buses, set to open in 2026. Other investments include hiring initiatives for bus operators, support for community transportation needs, and plans for service during the 2026 FIFA Men’s World Cup.
