  <p><strong>WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE TO SUPPORTERS OF MILITARY FAMILIES AND OPERATION HOMEFRONT?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Your gratitude ― whether through volunteer hours or monetary contributions ― is important. Keeping our military families strong and resilient helps our service members in their careers. Their strength and stability contribute to the well-being of our communities and our nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Your actions play a part in making our military families feel appreciated, and that is easily forgotten when you’re living on constant countdown to when your service member comes home from deployment or when they leave again.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Remember that appreciation has far-reaching effects. Some examples of your gratitude in action:&nbsp;</p>



  <ul>
  <li>When new military parents meet at an Operation Homefront Star-Spangled Babies® Shower, they come away with gifts and resources. They also connect with families that might become their lifelong friends and support networks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>



  <ul>
  <li>The other parent a military mom meets in line at a Back-to-School Brigade® event could be the emergency contact at her child’s new school.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>



  <ul>
  <li>That food from a Holiday Meals for Military® event could be the only reason a struggling military family celebrates Thanksgiving. In the holiday spirit, they likely will invite others to their dinner. Gifts from a Holiday Toy Drive could be the only ones under the tree when parents have to face the heart-wrenching choice of buying food or a small present for their child.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
