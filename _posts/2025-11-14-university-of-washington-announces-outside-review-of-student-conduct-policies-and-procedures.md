The University of Washington has announced an external review of its student conduct policies and procedures, led by the firm Husch Blackwell. President Robert J. Jones emphasized the importance of transparency and fairness in the enforcement of the Student Conduct Code, highlighting the need for adaptability to contemporary challenges not addressed in the last update of the code in 2021. The review will assess the effectiveness of these policies, particularly regarding compliance with Title VI, Title IX, and other civil rights laws, and will focus on various forms of misconduct, including sexual and non-academic issues. While the review will not focus on individual cases, it may consider specific instances to identify trends. The aim is to complete the review by winter quarter 2026, with the implementation of recommendations following its conclusion. Husch Blackwell's team has extensive experience working with numerous colleges and universities, including public institutions in the Big Ten, ensuring a comprehensive approach to the unique aspects of campus life.
