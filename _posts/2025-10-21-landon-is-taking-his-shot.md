  <p><span data-contrast="none">Landon’s always been athletic—he’s done soccer and cross country, and he’s been participating in </span><a href="https://www.spokanehoopfest.net/"><span data-contrast="none">Spokane’s Hoopfest basketball tournament</span></a><span data-contrast="none"> since he was 6 years old. But those came too easily for this young man who likes a challenge. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>

  <h3>Difficult Adolescent Years</h3>
  <p><span data-contrast="none">The difficulty paired with the community of joining youth hockey leagues got Landon through difficult adolescent years while experiencing foster care.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}"> </span><span data-contrast="none">“I did do a lot of moving around, swapped a bunch of schools in middle school,” he recalls. “It was around covid—it was kind of horrible. It definitely separated me from everyone, from everything—but hockey.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}"> </span></p>
  <p><span data-contrast="none">When he was 12, his stepdad gave him a hockey net, and Landon remembers practicing outside for hours, regardless of the weather. “If I was stressed over school or something, I would just, like, go shoot putts in my front yard,” he says.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335557856&quot;:16777215,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:279}"> </span></p>
  <p><span data-contrast="none">“I was really fortunate with who my foster parents were,” says Landon. “My sister and I moved together to the same house. She already knew who they were, so they weren&#8217;t completely random.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}"> </span></p>
  <h3>The Treehouse Difference</h3>
  <p><span data-contrast="none">Treehouse also entered the picture at this time. “I didn&#8217;t need their help as much as other people, but it&#8217;s kind of nice to have that weekly check-in at school, while you&#8217;re going through a rough time at home or you&#8217;re slipping on your grades or something,” shared Landon.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}"> </span></p>

When it came close to, like, a school dance or graduation, they told me how I can have my tassel and my gown reimbursed, and how I could have the dance tickets paid for.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0}"> </span></p>

Landon, an athletic young man, has transitioned from soccer and cross country to hockey, which he started at age 10 despite initial struggles. His involvement in youth hockey leagues provided crucial support during challenging times in foster care, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic when he faced significant disruptions in his life. Practicing hockey outdoors helped him cope with stress, and he benefited from a supportive foster family.

Treehouse played a vital role in Landon’s journey by offering consistent check-ins and assistance with academic and extracurricular activities. With their support, he graduated high school on time and is now playing hockey at Washington State University while studying business. Landon has also successfully maintained a window-cleaning business throughout college, showcasing his entrepreneurial spirit.

Grateful for the sense of family that hockey has provided, Landon emphasizes the importance of community and connection for overcoming hardships. He encourages others facing difficulties to seek support and cherish their relationships, recognizing that even a single person can make a significant difference in their lives.
