Happy October! As the weather changes, so do the needs of residents. There is a particular shortage of essential items, marked in bold. To assist, donations can be made through the organization's Amazon wishlist, where items are removed as they are purchased. If an item remains on the list, it is still needed. While out running errands, consider picking up pajamas, travel toiletries, or extra packs of paper towels. Sharing the wishlist can help reach more people and increase support for those in need.
