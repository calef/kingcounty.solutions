Lace Lawrence has joined Inatai as a Program Officer on the Grantmaking team. Raised in Kittitas County, she describes herself as tenacious, empathetic, and curious. After graduating from Washington State University during a recession, Lace transitioned into philanthropy, working in various roles from university fundraising to grassroots nonprofits. Her experiences with grant review panels and at a family foundation highlighted the complexities of traditional giving, leading her to Inatai's community-centered approach.

Lace is excited to learn from Washington communities striving for justice and equity, appreciating the transformative ecosystems they create. As a First Descendant of the Yakama Nation with settler roots, she is connected to multiple communities, including the queer community and women’s rugby. She values the Seven Generation Principle, which fosters hope for future generations. Among her inspirations is musician Brandi Carlile, whose activism she admires. Lace enjoys exploring the Yakima Valley and is currently reading "Kinship: Belonging in a World of Relation." Outside of work, she engages with nature through various outdoor activities, writes creatively, and is exploring pine needle basket making.
