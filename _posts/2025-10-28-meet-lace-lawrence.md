  the WSU Foundation. Raised in a family that deeply valued service, it turned out
  to be a perfect fit. I moved from university fundraising to grassroots nonprofits,
  to a role as a grant-writing and nonprofit consultant. Along the way, I joined grant
  review panels and held a director role at a family foundation, which showed me both
  the power and pitfalls of traditional giving. When Inatai launched, I was immediately
  drawn to its bold, community-centered approach, so when this Program Officer position

  What excites you most about being part of Team Inatai?</strong></p>\n<p>I am most
  excited to learn from communities across Washington that are building power and
  fighting for a more just and equitable future. In a time when progress is being
  rolled back, I’m proud to stand with and support those creating change. I’m especially
  inspired by the ecosystems of transformation communities are building—and honored
  to be part of that work. I am also blown away by the incredible people at Inatai
  and thrilled to be working alongside them.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Tell us about the
  community or communities you belong to.</strong></p>\n<p>I belong to many communities
  that shape who I am: I’m a First Descendant of the Yakama Nation with settler roots,
  a proud Coug, and deeply connected to the Yakima Valley. I played and coached women’s
  rugby for years and consider myself a rugger for life. I also come from a long line
  of ranchers and rodeo. I identify as queer and have found a home in the queer community.</p>\n<p><strong>5.
  Inatai’s strategies are underlined by a 50-Year Vision informed by communities.
  What is it about your community that keeps you hopeful for the future?</strong></p>\n<p>One
  of the things I love about Inatai is the focus on the Seven Generation Principle.
  I was raised with this belief and the more I see this principle and additional kinship
  principles taking up space in advocacy and community work, the more hope I have.</p>\n<p><strong>6.
  Finish this sentence: The Inatai value the most resonates with me is&#8230;</strong></p>\n<p>Abundance.</p>\n<p><strong>7.
  Who is your favorite Washingtonian?  </strong></p>\n<p>I’m a bit obsessed with Brandi
  Carlile—not just her music, but her collaborations and the people she uplifts. The
  Highwomen is a brilliant feminist country project, and her work with Tanya Tucker
  and Joni Mitchell is inspiring. Her activism through the Looking Out Foundation
  makes her even more admirable.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Where is your favorite place in
  Washington?</strong></p>\n<p>I grew up in the Yakima Valley with family ranches
  spread from Toppenish to White Swan. Driving the back roads of the Valley with the
  window rolled down just taking in the smells of the sage brush and the crops will
  always be my happy place.</p>\n<p><strong>9. What is the last thing you read, watched,
  or listened to that you would recommend? Why?</strong></p>\n<p>I’m a voracious reader
  and usually have a few books going at once. Right now, I’m working through Kinship:
  Belonging in a World of Relation, a beautiful essay collection co-edited by Gavin
  Van Horn, Robin Wall Kimmerer, and John Hausdoerffer exploring how we’re in relationship
  with the world and each other—it’s hopeful and grounding. For fiction, I loved The
  Book Censor’s Library by Bothayna Al-Essa, a satirical dystopia with Wonderland
  vibes. It dives into banned books, memory erasure, and the resilience of stories—a
  powerful reminder of imagination’s role in resistance.</p>\n<p><strong>10. What
  do you like to do when you’re not at work?</strong></p>\n<p>I love to be with nature—skiing,
  biking, hiking, and paddling are my go-tos. I write creative nonfiction prose and
  poetry, with occasional publication. Making art is a joy, even when it’s messy.
  I’m always trying new forms, and right now I’m really into pine needle basket making.
  I grew up riding horses and jump at any chance to get back in the saddle.</p></div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</div>"
