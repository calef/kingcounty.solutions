  <p>In an October 30 press release, Catholic Charities USA (CCUSA) announced immediate nationwide food assistance in response to rising demand caused by SNAP benefit cuts and the federal government shutdown. Over the next few weeks, several CCSWW programs — including the Queen Anne Food Bank, King County, the Tri-Parrish Food Bank, Burlington, and The Community Kitchen, Thurston County — will receive 14 pallets of produce from CCUSA to distribute to clients and others affected by the delay.</p>



  <p>At the Queen Anne Food Bank, our staff has seen a 70% increase in demand over the past two weeks and have provided food to an additional 375 CCS clients using existing stock. We will continue to meet this growing need as best we can until the new shipments arrive early next week.</p>



  <p>“We are deeply grateful to Catholic Charities USA for their swift and generous support. This vital food assistance allows us to continue serving our neighbors with dignity and compassion during a time of urgent need.” – Erin Maguire, King County Agency Director</p>



  <p>&#8220;The Queen Anne Food Bank is grateful to CCUSA for providing additional food for us to continue our life saving work of feeding all who come to us and are hungry.&#8221; &#8211; Katie O&#8217;Neill, King County Regional Network Builder</p>

Catholic Charities USA (CCUSA) announced on October 30 that it will provide immediate food assistance in response to increased demand from SNAP benefit cuts and the federal government shutdown. Over the coming weeks, various programs through Catholic Community Services of Western Washington (CCSWW) will receive 14 pallets of produce to distribute to those in need. The Queen Anne Food Bank has experienced a 70% increase in demand recently, serving an additional 375 clients with existing supplies. Erin Maguire, King County Agency Director, expressed gratitude for CCUSA's support, emphasizing its importance in serving the community compassionately during urgent times. Katie O’Neill, from the Queen Anne Food Bank, highlighted the vital role of CCUSA’s donation in continuing their efforts to feed the hungry. Additionally, The Community Kitchen in Olympia has been assembling food boxes with donated ingredients, distributing 200 boxes to clients this week to address the growing food insecurity exacerbated by reduced SNAP benefits. Gabe Ash, Director of Housing and Homeless Services, noted that these efforts will be strengthened by the donations from CCUSA, particularly benefiting rural farm worker communities facing increased challenges.
