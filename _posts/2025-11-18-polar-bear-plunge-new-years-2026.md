Join the Polar Bear Plunge on Jan. 1, 2026, at noon at Matthews Beach Park, where participants can take a refreshing dip in the lake to kick off the new year. A special plunge for younger participants will occur at 11:45 a.m. This free event, which started in 2003 and now attracts more than 1,900 participants, is supervised by lifeguards to ensure safety. Attendees are encouraged to dress in costumes and are advised to swim at their own risk due to potential waterborne bacteria and untested lake conditions in winter. Safety tips include consulting healthcare professionals for those with medical concerns, not consuming alcohol, and limiting time in the water to 15 minutes to prevent hypothermia. Participants should keep outer clothing on until ready to enter the water and change out of wet clothes immediately after the plunge. For more information, contact Meadowbrook Pool at 206-684-4989. This event has become a beloved tradition in the Seattle area, inspiring similar events throughout the region.
