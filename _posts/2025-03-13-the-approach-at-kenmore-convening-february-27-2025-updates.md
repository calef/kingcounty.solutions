On February 27, 2025, Imagine Housing held a community convening with Kenmore city officials to discuss the proposed development at Kenmore City Hall. Key points from the meeting included plans for approximately 126 parking spaces across two levels, efforts to enhance natural lighting in apartments, and the project's estimated total cost of around $90 million. The land purchase price was set at $1.5 million, with previous acquisition costs at $3.2 million. The mobile home park adjacent to the project remains unaffected. Rent will be based on a household's income relative to the area median income (AMI), specifically targeting those earning between 50% and 60% of the AMI, but no specific discounts for disabilities were mentioned. Applications for housing will be available online, without needing a case manager's referral. Concerns about the project's impact on community resources, such as green space and traffic management, were addressed, confirming that the design includes a rooftop deck for families. The project aims to meet parking standards influenced by various factors, with a commitment to exploring additional parking solutions. Overall, the convening facilitated transparency and community engagement regarding the development's scope and objectives.
