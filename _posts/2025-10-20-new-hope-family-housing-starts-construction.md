Construction has commenced for New Hope Family Housing in Seattle's Central Area, led by the New Hope Community Development Institute (NHCDI) and the Low Income Housing Institute (LIHI). The development will be situated on two properties owned by the New Hope Missionary Baptist Church at 114 and 123 21st Ave, featuring a total of 92 affordable apartments, including studio, one, and two-bedroom units, aimed at families and individuals earning up to 50% and 60% of the area median income (AMI). Additionally, the project will include office space for NHCDI and Clean Greens, a nonprofit produce market.

Rev. Dr. Robert L. Jeffrey, Sr. expressed excitement over the project, highlighting its importance in addressing housing needs amid rising rents and displacement in the area. LIHI Executive Director Sharon Lee noted the collaboration with NHCDI to utilize a new Seattle code that allows increased density on religious land. The development will cover a site area of 23,838 square feet, with a total building area of 71,530 gross square feet, and is expected to be completed by Spring 2027. Financing sources include various city and state funds, as well as low-income housing tax credits.
