  <p>At Valley Medical Center, we pride ourselves on providing something extra with the care you receive. Our mission is to care for our community like family, and our staff truly lives by it. In the world of cancer care, with high stakes diagnoses and a rollercoaster of emotions, the extra heart you receive from your caregivers is more important than ever.</p>



  <p>“Each day, we are presented with opportunities for growth and learning while we find joy in making a difference, providing care, and supporting one another,” said Chermaine Wulff, Infusion Center Manager, in a message to the Cancer Services team. “Your unwavering commitment to our mission is inspiring, and I am so proud of all that we&#8217;ve accomplished together.</p>



  <p>“Looking ahead, I am excited for what the new year will bring. Our move will allow us to care for even more patients, and I know that, with your continued dedication, we’ll accomplish great things.”</p>



  <p>Don’t take our word for it. Read on to hear from our Cancer Services staff and leaders about what led them down their pathways to cancer care and why it’s so meaningful.</p>



  <h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why do you enjoy working in cancer care?</strong></h2>



  <p>“Working in Oncology, we see amazing things every single day.  We meet incredible people and their families.  We get to build relationships with them over a long period of time, and support them through their diagnosis, treatment and ultimately their survivorship.  Working in cancer care has taught me to appreciate the small moments in life and give gratitude for the present moment.”<strong> </strong><br><strong>– Jennifer Ammerman, Medical Assistant, Oncology Clinic</strong></p>



  <p>“I enjoy working in cancer care because I get to be part of the patient’s journey in defeating financial barriers. There is nothing more rewarding than being the person who gets to tell the patient they are approved for something they didn&#8217;t know existed, such as a cash grant or free treatment.”<br><strong> – Melody Laggad, Oncology Financial Coordinator</strong></p>



  <p>“I enjoy helping people navigate through one of the most difficult times of their lives. It is an honor to be able to meet people where they are at in the process and maximize their quality of life as go through treatments.” <br>– <strong>Jennifer Maiorca, Registered Nurse, Radiation Oncology</strong></p>



  <p>“Amazing patients who appreciate the work that you do. I feel sense of accomplishment knowing that I get to work with cancer patients and get to help them through their journey of healing.”<strong> </strong><br><strong>– Anonymous, Radiation Oncology</strong></p>



  <p>“I am grateful for the opportunity to sit with patients and their families as they navigate their diagnosis and treatment. Radiation therapy is complex and can be intimidating. If I am able to allay a patient&#8217;s fears, I have had a good day.”<strong> </strong><br><strong>– Stephen Eulau, MD, Radiation Oncologist</strong></p>



  <h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What makes the Cancer Services teams at Valley so special?</strong></h2>



  <p>“We are blessed with a wonderful team, the respect and support we have for one another is unmatched. Our leaders are so amazing with encouraging us, teaching us and supporting us.”<br><strong> – Tanika Sims, Oncology Navigator</strong></p>



  <p>“Our team at Valley is so special because everyone you work with has a passion to do their best to serve the patients in our community. We develop deeper relationships with our patients as we get to know them in their care journey and truly start to feel like they become our family. Every day, we link arms and do whatever it takes to provide emotional support, lighten financial burdens, or knock out anything in the patients way so they can focus on healing. There is something truly magical about being able to work alongside the people in Cancer Services who share the same passion.”<strong> </strong><br><strong>– Melody Laggad, Oncology Financial Coordinator</strong></p>



  <p>“Our team is really a family unit. I feel that because we are such a bonded staff, it allows us to work together smoothly. This, in effect, gives the patient a more relaxed environment when they get their treatment. This is important because it can aid in breaking down barriers caused by apprehensions and stress and help provide better care.”<strong> </strong><br><strong>– Annie Mae Palermo, Radiation Therapist Sr.</strong></p>



  <h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What sets apart the care that patients receive at Valley?</strong></h2>



  <p>“The time and care that is given is unmatched. You never get the rushed through and passed along or around feeling. The Care is individualized and personalized and you really feel like you matter and that your important. That is such a great and comforting feeling in world and time where everything seems to be fast paced and non personalized.”<strong> </strong><br><strong>– April Benton, Patient Access Associate, Infusion Center</strong></p>



  <p>“Care is patient-centered. Since we see patients day in and day out, for weeks at a time, we really get to know the patients like family. Often times, patients are quite sad to be done seeing us.” <br>– <strong>Jennifer Maiorca, Registered Nurse, Radiation Oncology</strong></p>



  <p>“I have worked in Oncology for 25 years and Valley provides some of the best care. The communication between departments and providers, which I feel is so important, and going the extra mile to get patient appointments in a timely manner to avoid delays in treatment.”<strong> </strong><br><strong>– Tanika Sims, Oncology Navigator</strong></p>



  <h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Do you have any memorable stories about your colleagues or patients at Valley?</strong></h2>



  <p>“I have one patient who stands out because she started her radiation treatments so afraid that she was almost in tears. Over the course of her treatments, my partner and I were able to get her talking and she started to relax and even laugh! By the time she got into the swing of her daily treatments she had inspired the entire radiation staff to wear a different pair of earrings each day for her. We had to show her daily what we were wearing, and she would put the information in her journal. I had a family vacation in the middle of her treatment, but I would text my coworker a photo of my earrings daily to show our patient to make sure she knew she was still in my thoughts even when I wasn&#8217;t at the clinic. When she finished her treatments, we all hugged and clapped for her victory, and I still smile when remembering all the fun we had with her.”<br><strong>– Annie Mae Palermo, Radiation Therapist Sr.</strong></p>



  <p>“I was invited by Dr. Douglas to help develop a prostate implant program here and struck by the focus and support of the administration, support staff and medical colleagues.&nbsp; As the program grew, I spent progressively more time at Valley.&nbsp; And then a funny thing happened: I fell in love with the place &#8211; the patients, the staff, and most importantly the authentic warmth and commitment to care I saw all around me.&nbsp; So, when the opportunity arose, I chose to practice here full time.&nbsp; Best. Decision. Ever.”<strong> </strong><br><strong>– Stephen Eulau, MD, Radiation Oncologist</strong></p>



  <p>“I will personally say that in the short about of time that I have been at Valley that my Infusion Team has become a family. They have supported and uplifted me in my personal times of needs. The outpouring of love and support that I have personally received has been mind blowing to me and I am forever grateful to MY VALLEY FAMILY.”<strong> </strong><br><strong>– April Benton, Patient Access Associate, Infusion Center</strong></p>



  <p>“Too many to list! Supporting our staff through their own cancer diagnosis, rallying around each other during the good times and bad.  I have been touched by so many patient experiences. My patients are why I believe in miracles! I even plant flowers for special patients I have lost to honor their memory and the life they lived. I have begonias for a patient who was a teacher and poppies for a patient who loved California.”<strong> </strong><br><strong>– Jennifer Ammerman, Medical Assistant, Oncology Clinic</strong></p>
