A recent land-use report highlights the significant potential for affordable housing development in East King County, particularly through the collaboration of faith-based organizations. The Eastside Housing Analysis reveals that over 200 religious-owned parcels could be eligible for density bonuses, allowing for approximately 9,000 new affordable housing units. Rising rents and home prices have created a housing crisis, with many essential workers unable to afford homes. As of 2022, the Area Median Income (AMI) is $92,000, with a notable gap of over 11,000 rental homes needed for those earning less than $75,000. The report emphasizes the need for innovative land-use policies and financing strategies to support mixed-income developments. It also notes that many households are cost-burdened, particularly single parents and seniors on fixed incomes. Imagine Housing is actively partnering with local churches to implement development plans for around 200 family-focused affordable housing units, utilizing Bellevue’s Affordable Housing Strategy as a model. This initiative aims to empower churches to fulfill their missions while addressing the urgent need for affordable housing in the community.
