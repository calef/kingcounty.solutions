The completion of the Rainier Avenue South Bus Lane project has been announced, extending the northbound bus-only lane from South Walden Street to South Grand Street. This initiative by the Seattle Department of Transportation aims to enhance the reliability of Route 7, which serves an average of 12,000 daily riders. The project includes repairs to sidewalks, the addition of marked crosswalks and signals, improved sidewalks, ADA-accessible curb ramps, and new streetlights to boost safety and accessibility. It is expected to save riders nearly 5 minutes per trip during peak morning hours.

The bus lane extension will facilitate better connections with other transit options, including the upcoming Link 2 Line and Judkins Park Light Rail Station, improving overall transit efficiency in the Rainier Valley. With buses scheduled every 10 minutes or less, the enhancements are designed to alleviate delays caused by traffic congestion, making public transportation a more attractive choice. Funded by the Seattle Transit Measure, this project reflects Seattle's commitment to creating a sustainable and equitable transportation system while addressing climate change and benefiting the community. Future plans include the construction of King County Metro’s RapidRide R Line, promising further improvements.
