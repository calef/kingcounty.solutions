Construction is set to begin on 125th Senior Housing, a new seven-story building in North Seattle that will provide 90 units for seniors earning 30% to 50% of the area median income. The site, previously home to LIHI’s Friendship Heights Tiny House Village, aims to continue the organization’s mission of converting tiny house sites into permanent housing. Seniors aged 62 and over will pay 30% of their income for high-quality, energy-efficient living. Located at 12245 Aurora Ave. N., the building is close to essential services, grocery stores, and has access to public transportation.

LIHI has secured a HUD 202 Senior Housing award, which includes $3.3 million for construction and operational subsidies for 89 units, making it the only recipient in the Pacific Northwest for 2023. Additional funding comes from the City of Seattle ($9.9 million), the State Housing Trust Fund ($5 million), and various federal sources totaling $6 million. KeyBank is providing financing through the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program. The project is designed by Runberg Architecture Group and will be constructed by Marpac Construction.
