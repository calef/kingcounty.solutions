  <p>Seasonal depression—or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.talkspace.com/mental-health/conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/">seasonal affective disorder</a> (SAD)—is a type of depression that appears in the winter months, when days are shorter, colder, and darker. If you’ve noticed a heavy sadness, loss of energy, or shifts in sleep and appetite patterns during the cool seasons, you might be experiencing seasonal depression.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Several frontline treatments for seasonal depression are available, including light therapy, lifestyle changes, and counseling. There are also some natural over-the-counter options that might provide relief. Continue reading to learn more about supplements and vitamins for seasonal depression that may help you get through this winter.</p>



  <p><strong><em>Please be aware: </em></strong><em>These holistic methods may not work the same way or be as effective as some more conventional methods of treatment. You should discuss any natural treatment you decide to try with your doctor or healthcare team. Sometimes natural methods can be most effective when coupled with more traditional forms of psychological treatment, like when used in combination with anxiety medication and/or talk therapy.</em></p>



  <h3>1. Vitamin D</h3>



  <p>If you&#8217;re wondering &#8220;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/why-am-i-so-sad/">why am I so sad</a> during winter?,&#8221; it may be linked to a lack of vitamin D. You may have heard of vitamin D referred to as “the sunshine vitamin”—your body naturally produces vitamin D when you’re exposed to sunlight. It makes sense, then, that when the sun hides behind the winter clouds and limits your day-to-day access to natural sunlight, vitamin D levels can drop along with serotonin levels, impacting mood and increasing your risk of depression, especially if you have seasonal affective disorder.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Vitamin D helps regulate <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/serotonin-what-is-defintion/">serotonin levels</a> in the brain, stabilizing mood and sleep patterns. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9468237/">Research links</a> low vitamin D levels to increased symptoms of depression and anxiety, and while more research is needed, some <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32365423/">studies</a> suggest it might be a supplement for seasonal depression relief that actually works.</p>



  <p><strong>How to get it</strong>: Boost your serotonin and vitamin D levels through exposure to sunlight or a lightbox and by eating a variety of fatty fish, fortified foods, and supplements.</p>



  <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>“Light therapy has substantial research showing its efficacy with improving symptoms of seasonal depression vitamins and supplements fit into an overall treatment plan for SAD. These supplements can be an adjunct to light protocols by enhancing levels of needed nutrients for added symptom reduction.”</p>
  <cite>&#8211; <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/mental-health/conditions/author/karmensmith/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Talkspace therapist, Dr Karmen Smith LCSW DD</a></cite></blockquote>



  <h3>2. Vitamin B12 and B Complex</h3>



  <p>Seasonal depression can cause exhaustion and sluggishness that goes beyond just feeling sad. Vitamin B12 and other B vitamins (like folate, riboflavin, and niacin) are vital for brain health and energy regulation. If your levels are low, you might feel more fatigued or experience poor concentration and low moods.</p>



  <p>It’s thought that taking B-complex vitamins can increase your energy levels and improve brain function during the darker winter months. Because vitamin B1 (thiamin) is essential to neurological function and energy production, a deficiency may be <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11206829/">associated with</a> mood disorders and depression. Taking B <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.talkspace.com/mental-health/conditions/articles/vitamins-for-depression/">vitamins for depression</a> could be effective in some cases.&nbsp;</p>



  <p><strong>How to get it</strong>: Sources rich in B vitamins include meat, dairy, eggs, and fortified cereals. You may also benefit from taking supplements.&nbsp;</p>



  <h3>3. Omega-3 Fatty Acids</h3>



  <p>Omega-3 fatty acids are found in fish oil and flaxseed. Omega-3s are good for your heart and enhance brain function, but they also play a critical role in mood regulation and overall brain health.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Multiple <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5481805/">studies</a> have suggested that omega-3 fatty acids might be an effective way to treat major depressive disorder (MDD), improving mood regulation and supporting brain function. More research should be done, but eating a diet rich in omega-3 fats might reduce depressive symptoms and manage seasonal depression in some people.&nbsp;</p>



  <p><strong>How to get it</strong>: Get omega-3 fatty acids from fatty fish, like salmon, mackerel, sardines, and anchovies. For plant-based options, try flaxseeds, chia seeds, walnuts, and canola oil. You can also take fish oil supplements.&nbsp;</p>



  <h3>4. Magnesium</h3>



  <p>Magnesium is a powerful way to help manage mood and deal with stress. If your body is low in magnesium, you may feel more anxious, fatigued, and generally unhappy. Magnesium is essential for numerous bodily functions. It’s necessary for everything from calming brain chemistry to regulating the stress hormone cortisol. According to some <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7761127/">studies</a>, there’s a potential link between magnesium deficiency and anxiety, low mood, and seasonal depression. If you’re looking for the best supplements and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/vitamins-for-stress/">vitamins for stress</a> in particular, magnesium is the way to go.&nbsp;</p>



  <p><strong>How to get it</strong>: Magnesium is found in leafy green vegetables, nuts, seeds, and over-the-counter supplements.</p>



  <h3>5. St. John’s Wort (Herbal Supplement)</h3>



  <p>St. John’s Wort is an herbal supplement known for boosting mood by increasing levels of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, chemicals in the brain that can dip during seasonal depression. Although evidence is limited, some <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK557465/">research</a> found that St. John’s Wort performed better than placebos in reducing <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.talkspace.com/mental-health/conditions/depression/symptoms/">symptoms of depression</a>, offering hope that the herbal supplement might be an effective aid or alternative to prescription drugs for treating seasonal and other types of depression.</p>



  <p><em>Note that St. John’s Wort can interact with some prescription medications, including antidepressants, birth control pills, and blood thinners. If you’re thinking about taking it for seasonal depression or any other reason, medical guidance from a licensed doctor is essential.</em></p>



  <p><strong>How to get it</strong>: St. John’s Wort is a readily available supplement that can be found at most drugstores or online.</p>



  <h3>6. Probiotics</h3>



  <p>Although it might not be the first thing you think of, more and more research links gut health to mood. The gut-brain connection stems from the importance of a healthy microbiome, the collection of helpful bacteria that lives in your digestive system.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Gut health influences mood and emotional well-being. In a collection of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10490379/">studies</a>, participants who used probiotics to improve microbiome health reported significantly lower depression scores. These findings suggest that probiotic supplements for seasonal affective disorder might be an effective treatment option. At the very least, the results warrant further research to determine if probiotics might help treat SAD. If you’ve noticed a change in your digestive system during the winter months, adding probiotics to your diet might be a gentle way to improve your mood and combat seasonal affective disorder.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p><strong>How to get it</strong>: Probiotics are found in yogurt, fermented foods, and supplements.</p>



  <h2>When to Seek a Mental Health Professional for More Support</h2>



  <p>Supplements and vitamins for seasonal affective disorder relief can be effective, but some people need a more comprehensive approach. If your seasonal symptoms persist or worsen, or if they interfere with your daily life and functioning, it’s time to seek professional help. For some people, supplements alone are not enough to address the complexities of SAD. Vitamins and supplements almost always work best when they’re used as part of a comprehensive care plan. Behavioral therapies like <a href="https://www.talkspace.com/blog/benefits-of-cbt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cognitive behavioral therapy</a> (CBT), <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6746555/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">light therapy</a>, and certain medications are also effective in treating this form of depression.</p>



  <blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>“Nowdays, people are looking for a quick fix when it comes to mental health, it won’t be found in one pill or supplement. The risks in relying solely on supplements without behavioral or psychotherapeutic support for SAD is that the core issues fail to be addressed. This can create a pattern or cycles of symptoms rather than a path to healing.”</p>

title: 6 Vitamins & Supplements to Help Seasonal Depression
topics:
- Mental Health & Counseling
- Health Care
---

Seasonal depression, or seasonal affective disorder (SAD), is a type of depression that typically occurs in winter months due to shorter days and reduced sunlight. Symptoms may include sadness, loss of energy, and changes in sleep and appetite. While light therapy, lifestyle changes, and counseling are common treatments, certain vitamins and supplements may also provide relief.

1. **Vitamin D**: Known as the "sunshine vitamin," vitamin D production decreases in winter, potentially lowering serotonin levels and impacting mood. Supplementation can help regulate mood and sleep patterns.

2. **Vitamin B12 and B complex**: These vitamins are vital for brain health and energy. Low levels can lead to fatigue and low moods. B-complex vitamins may enhance energy and brain function during winter.

3. **Omega-3 fatty acids**: Found in fish oil and flaxseed, omega-3s support mood regulation and brain health, potentially reducing depressive symptoms.

4. **Magnesium**: This mineral helps manage mood and stress. Low magnesium may be linked to anxiety and low mood.

5. **St. John’s wort**: This herbal supplement may boost mood by increasing serotonin levels, though it can interact with medications.

6. **Probiotics**: Gut health is linked to mood; probiotics may help improve emotional well-being.

Consulting with a healthcare provider before starting any supplement is advisable, especially for those experiencing persistent symptoms.
