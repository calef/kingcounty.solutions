Seasonal depression, or seasonal affective disorder (SAD), is a type of depression that typically occurs in winter months due to shorter days and reduced sunlight. Symptoms may include sadness, loss of energy, and changes in sleep and appetite. While light therapy, lifestyle changes, and counseling are common treatments, certain vitamins and supplements may also provide relief.

1. **Vitamin D**: Known as the "sunshine vitamin," Vitamin D production decreases in winter, potentially lowering serotonin levels and impacting mood. Supplementation can help regulate mood and sleep patterns.

2. **Vitamin B12 and B Complex**: These vitamins are vital for brain health and energy. Low levels can lead to fatigue and low moods. B-complex vitamins may enhance energy and brain function during winter.

3. **Omega-3 Fatty Acids**: Found in fish oil and flaxseed, omega-3s support mood regulation and brain health, potentially reducing depressive symptoms.

4. **Magnesium**: This mineral helps manage mood and stress. Low magnesium may be linked to anxiety and low mood.

5. **St. John’s Wort**: This herbal supplement may boost mood by increasing serotonin levels, though it can interact with medications.

6. **Probiotics**: Gut health is linked to mood; probiotics may help improve emotional well-being.

Consulting with a healthcare provider before starting any supplement is advisable, especially for those experiencing persistent symptoms.
