Friends of Youth has launched Bridge Pointe Housing, a 90-day transitional housing initiative aimed at supporting young adults aged 18 to 24 transitioning from inpatient behavioral health treatment to independent living. This program, the second of its kind in Washington state, is funded by the Washington State Health Care Authority and seeks to address housing instability among youth. Bridge Pointe Housing offers a voluntary short-term residential stay designed to help participants stabilize, recover, and plan for their futures in a safe and supportive environment. Each residence emphasizes safety and community, providing trauma-informed and recovery-oriented services tailored to individual needs.

The first residence is set to open this summer, with plans for a second location following renovations. Both homes will be staffed by trained professionals dedicated to youth development and mental health recovery. Recognizing the gaps in support after inpatient care, the initiative aims to prevent relapse and homelessness by providing a dignified pathway toward long-term stability. Friends of Youth is also engaging with the community to share more about the program and encourage collaboration in supporting youth. Bridge Pointe Housing reflects the organization's commitment to empowering young people and addressing the challenges posed by behavioral health issues and housing instability.
