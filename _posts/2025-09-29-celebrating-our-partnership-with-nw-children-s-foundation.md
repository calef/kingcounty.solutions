NW Children's Foundation is celebrated for its ongoing partnership with Friends of Youth, particularly in supporting the New Ground Totem Lake (NGTL) Transitional Living Program (TLP). This program assists young adults aged 18 to 21 by providing up to 18 months of stable housing and essential wraparound services, including case management, education support, and access to behavioral health services. As housing costs in King County rise and homelessness among youth persists, NGTL’s services are vital for fostering stability and success.

This year, a notable success story emerged from the program. A client, who transitioned from another Friends of Youth program, completed high school and began pursuing a business degree despite facing transportation challenges between Kirkland and Seattle. After 18 months in NGTL, the client successfully moved to a new TLP closer to school and is now seeking local employment. The case manager continues to support the client through the aftercare program, providing assistance during the 2024 holiday season with gifts from the Giving Tree initiative, including new running shoes. This partnership exemplifies the commitment to helping young people find safety, healing, and hope for brighter futures.
