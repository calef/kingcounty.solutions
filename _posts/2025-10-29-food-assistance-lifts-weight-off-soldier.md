  **Food Assistance Lifts Weight Off Soldier and Family During Federal Shutdown**

  As federal lawmakers remained at a stalemate over government funding in mid-October, Army Staff Sgt. Jorge Martinez and his wife, Carolina, watched and worried from their home in Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  Among the dozens of questions they had about the likelihood of working without pay, they knew one certainty: Their family’s budget did not have the reserves for a missed paycheck.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  The Martinez family relies solely on Jorge’s income, and Carolina stays home with their daughters, Adriana and Angelina. Adriana is a 16-year-old high school junior. Angelina, 18, is taking a year off after completing high school.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Amid a federal government shutdown in October, Army Staff Sgt. Jorge Martinez and his family faced financial uncertainty with their sole income coming from his military salary. With rising food and utility costs, as well as medical expenses from his daughter’s epilepsy diagnosis, the Martinez family found their budget increasingly strained. Learning about Operation Homefront’s Critical Financial Assistance Program, which provides emergency food gift cards, brought hope to Jorge. After applying, he was relieved to receive a $500 food card, significantly easing their grocery expenses. Jorge expressed that this support was like a “life jacket” during stressful times. He joined the Army in 2008, seeking structure after a troubled youth. He has served in multiple combat deployments to Afghanistan, where he endured significant challenges. Now, with 17 years of service, he continues to instruct advanced training for motor transport operators. Jorge emphasized the vital role of donors in supporting military families, highlighting how their contributions provide essential relief during difficult periods.
