title: KCBA Joins Amicus Brief in Support of Perkins Coie
topics: []
---

Last week, the King County Bar Association (KCBA) joined an amicus brief in support of Perkins Coie, which seeks permanent injunctive relief in Federal District Court, D.C. The brief, filed on April 7, 2025, is backed by over a dozen bar associations, asserting that an Executive Order targeting Perkins Coie undermines the independence of the legal profession, constitutional democracy, and the rule of law. The KCBA's decision to support the brief was based on its commitment to the rule of law, regardless of the political affiliation of the President issuing such orders. The brief highlights the risks posed by coercive actions meant to silence dissent within the legal community. Additionally, on April 4, 2025, numerous law firms, former judges, and law professors also filed separate amicus briefs in support of Perkins Coie. To keep the public informed about the ongoing litigation, the KCBA has provided resources for access to relevant legal documents and updates. The KCBA acknowledges the efforts of the Protect Democracy Project and Jeannie Suk Gersen for their contributions to the brief.
