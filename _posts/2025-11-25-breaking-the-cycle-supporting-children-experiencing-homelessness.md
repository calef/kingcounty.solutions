original_content: "<p class=\"\">Homelessness is devastating at any age—but for children,
  the impacts can shape the course of their entire lives. Mary’s Place and our partners
  are working to minimize trauma and build pathways to stability for families, breaking
  generational cycles of homelessness.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">We gathered leaders
  from community programs supporting education and development for youth experiencing
  homelessness for a panel discussion about the impacts of homelessness on kids and
  how we can improve long-term outcomes. <a href=\"https://youtu.be/G7gvWmbqmCY\"

  does homelessness impact children?</strong>&nbsp;</h4><p class=\"\"><em>“Ninety
  percent of a child’s brain develops before age five. When children experience homelessness,
  poverty, and trauma during this critical period, it can lead to toxic stress, adverse
  childhood experiences (ACEs), disruptions in executive function, emotional regulation
  challenges, and learning loss,” </em>shared Dominique Alex of Mary’s Place.&nbsp;</p><p
  class=\"\">But the impacts extend far beyond brain development.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">Children
  experiencing homelessness are sick <strong>four times more often</strong> than their
  housed peers and experience <strong>three to four times the rate of developmental
  delays</strong>, especially in language, social skills, and motor development. Nearly <strong>50%
  of children under age four</strong> who are homeless show developmental delays—compared
  to about 12–16% of children in stable housing.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">Frequent moves,
  unsafe environments, and disrupted routines also increase emotional and behavioral
  challenges. Children who are homeless are <strong>three times more likely</strong> to
  experience anxiety, depression, and behavioral health issues. By age five, more
  than half have moved three or more times, creating instability that makes it harder
  to build relationships and feel secure.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">These health and
  developmental challenges compound over time, especially when homelessness lasts
  longer than six months, increasing the likelihood of long-term effects on learning,
  behavior, and future stability.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Closing education gaps</strong>&nbsp;</h4><p
  class=\"\">Our Youth Services program at Mary’s Place, and our community partners,
  like the McKinney-Vento program at Highline Public School, address one of the largest
  risk factors for children experiencing homelessness–becoming disconnected from school
  and early learning opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\"><em>“When a child doesn’t
  know where they’ll sleep at night, making it to school becomes incredibly difficult,”</em>
  shared Antonio Lewis, McKinney-Vento and Foster Care Liaison at Highline Public
  Schools.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\"><em>“According to our data, </em><strong><em>42%
  of students experiencing homelessness say they’ve dropped out of school at least
  once.</em></strong><em> Families who are couch surfing often move from place to
  place, making consistent attendance nearly impossible. For children living in cars
  or tents, the barriers grow—lack of transportation, no quiet place to study, and
  no internet access to complete assignments.</em>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\"><em>Overall,
  from what we’ve seen, children and teens experiencing homelessness face an </em><strong><em>87%
  likelihood of dropping out, chronic absenteeism, or disproportionate school discipline.”</em></strong>&nbsp;</p><p
  class=\"\">Nationally, students experiencing homelessness are:&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list=\"default\"><li><p

  class=\"\">The result is a high school graduation rate of just <strong>68%</strong> among
  students experiencing homelessness.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">These disruptions don’t
  just affect childhood—they are one of the strongest predictors that a child will
  experience homelessness again as an adult, continuing a cycle that becomes harder
  to break with every missed school day.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\"><em>“The federal McKinney-Vento
  program works to improve these outcomes by providing educational stability support
  for youth who are unstably housed,”</em> says Antonio. <em>“This support can look
  different for each student and ranges from providing transportation to school, to
  providing students with laptops and hotspots, and providing school meals to ensure
  students are fed.”</em>&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Reducing early childhood trauma</strong>&nbsp;</h4><p
  class=\"\">To understand how we can reduce early childhood trauma for children,
  we heard from <strong>Zivit Shechter Nissim, Kaleidoscope Play &amp; Learn Program
  Manager, Childcare Resources, at BrightSpark</strong>, a Mary’s Place partner at
  the Allen Family Center – a drop-in, free resource center for King County families
  experiencing homelessness or housing instability.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">The numbers
  she shared are staggering:&nbsp;</p><ul data-rte-list=\"default\"><li><p class=\"\">Pre-COVID,

Homelessness profoundly affects children, impacting their health and development. Mary’s Place and its partners aim to reduce trauma and create stable pathways for families, addressing the generational cycles of homelessness. During a recent panel, experts highlighted that 90% of a child's brain develops by age five, and experiencing homelessness during this time can lead to severe developmental delays and emotional distress. Children without stable housing are four times more likely to fall ill and face significant delays in language and social skills. Additionally, frequent relocations contribute to heightened anxiety and behavioral issues, making it challenging to build trust and security.

Education is also severely affected; nearly half of students experiencing homelessness have dropped out at least once. Many face barriers to consistent school attendance, leading to chronic absenteeism and lower academic performance. Programs like the federal McKinney-Vento initiative provide critical support for educational stability.

To mitigate trauma, Mary’s Place offers tailored programs for youth, including support in shelters and community resources. Their prevention efforts emphasize keeping families in their homes, highlighting that stability not only protects children's development but also enhances their future educational and health outcomes.
