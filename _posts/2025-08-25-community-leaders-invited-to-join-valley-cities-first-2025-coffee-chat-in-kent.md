Community leaders are invited to the first Community Coffee Chat of 2025, hosted by Valley Cities Behavioral Health Care on May 21 in Kent. This event will take place at the Multi Service Center, focusing on "Responding to the Fentanyl Crisis" and discussing Valley Cities' role in addressing substance use challenges in King County. The initiative has received positive feedback since its inception, bringing together local politicians, first responders, and business owners to engage in community support efforts.

During the chat, attendees will hear from experts on mental health and substance use disorders, and they will have the opportunity to ask questions and discuss how to better assist individuals facing these issues. Valley Cities is expanding its services, including a new contingency management plan for stimulant use, which provides incentive-based support over 12 weeks.

Regular Community Coffee Chats are held monthly across King County, each addressing different topics. Local leaders are encouraged to register for the May 21 event and stay informed about future gatherings through the Valley Cities newsletter. Valley Cities also offers various mental health and substance use programs, accepting donations to support their initiatives.
