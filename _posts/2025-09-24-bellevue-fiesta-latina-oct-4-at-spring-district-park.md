In celebration of National Hispanic Heritage Month, the City of Bellevue is hosting "Bellevue Fiesta Latina" on Saturday, October 4, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Spring District Park. The event will feature a diverse musical experience, various Latin American cuisines from local vendors, and booths run by community organizations supporting the Latino community. A pop-up market will be available throughout the event, and the Lake Washington Symphony Orchestra will perform a concert titled “Celebrating Latin America” from 3 to 4:15 p.m. Spring District Park, located at 12167 NE 14th Terrace, is accessible via the nearby light rail station. Both the concert and market are free for all ages, although registration is encouraged. Bellevue Fiesta Latina aims to honor the significant contributions of Latin American cultures to Bellevue and the broader United States, where Latinos represent 9% of the city's population and contribute to 60% alongside other communities of color. National Hispanic Heritage Month, recognized by a City Council proclamation on September 16, runs from September 15 to October 15, aligning with the independence days of several Latin American nations.
