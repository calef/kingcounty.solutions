Seattle police arrested a 31-year-old felon on November 18 after he eluded officers in a stolen Ford F-150 truck. Patrol officers, using an Automatic License Plate Reader, located the vehicle near Meridian Avenue North and North Northgate Way. Despite police attempts to stop the truck, the driver fled at high speed through a residential area. While the passenger exited the vehicle and was apprehended with the assistance of a helicopter, the driver managed to evade capture temporarily by entering a Goodwill store and changing clothes. Officers arrived shortly after and arrested him with help from store security. During the arrest, police found 25.9 grams of Fentanyl and drug paraphernalia. The truck was also recovered, containing burglary and auto theft tools, including a lock pick kit. The suspect, who has a criminal history involving firearms, stolen property, and theft, was booked into King County Jail on charges of Possession of a Stolen Vehicle, Eluding a Police Vehicle, and Possession with Intent to Distribute Narcotics. He is currently under active supervision and prohibited from engaging in criminal activity. Detectives from the General Investigations Unit are handling the case.
