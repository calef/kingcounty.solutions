Multi-Service Center (MSC) has been awarded a $10,000 grant from Gesa Credit Union’s Local Heroes Grant Program, facilitated by the Gesa Community Foundation. The funding will be used to upgrade technology and replace furniture in community common areas, particularly benefiting the William J. Wood Veterans House, which provides support for veterans and their families. Amber Merrill, Community Relations Manager at Gesa Credit Union, expressed pride in supporting organizations like MSC that positively impact the community. This year, Gesa awarded grants to 52 organizations across the Pacific Northwest, distributing over half a million dollars in total. Since its inception in 2021, the Local Heroes Grant Program has provided more than $2 million to over 200 organizations, aiming to support local heroes such as firefighters, healthcare workers, law enforcement, educators, and veterans. Phoebe Anderson-Kline, MSC Economic Opportunities Director, emphasized the importance of Gesa's support, noting that the enhancements will significantly improve the living conditions for residents at the veterans' house.
