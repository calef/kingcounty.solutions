Seattle's Department of Education and Early Learning (DEEL) has expanded the Child Care Assistance Program (CCAP) to support more families with child care costs. Families residing in Seattle can apply for financial assistance through the online portal, which benefits those with children aged 1 month to 12 years. On average, participating families save $7,500 annually. Eligibility criteria include living within Seattle city limits, having an income below 94% of the state median income, and demonstrating a need for child care due to work, school, or training obligations.

DEEL emphasizes the importance of affordable child care in fostering successful communities and supporting working parents. More than 263 licensed providers in Seattle accept CCAP vouchers, offering a variety of care options, including center-based and family child care. The program is inclusive, serving all eligible children regardless of citizenship status or other factors. With 844 children served in 2023 and 660 in 2024, DEEL continues to connect families to essential child care resources, ensuring a safe and nurturing environment for children while easing the financial burden on parents. In-language assistance is also available for families needing support.
