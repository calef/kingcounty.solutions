The VA offers a program called MOVE! that helps Veterans manage their weight and improve their health. Through this program, participants receive personalized support to create sustainable lifestyle changes. MOVE! emphasizes the importance of nutrition, physical activity, and behavioral modification in achieving weight loss and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.

Veterans enrolled in MOVE! benefit from the guidance of trained health coaches who assist them in setting realistic goals and provide ongoing encouragement. The program includes educational resources, group sessions, and one-on-one counseling tailored to individual needs.

Many Veterans have found success in the MOVE! program, leading to significant weight loss and improved overall well-being. The program not only addresses physical health but also promotes mental health and social connections among participants. By fostering a supportive community, MOVE! encourages Veterans to stay committed to their health journeys.

The VA continues to expand the MOVE! program, making it accessible to more Veterans across the country, ensuring that they have the resources to lead healthier lives.
