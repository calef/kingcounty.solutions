  Each November, we recognize Native American Heritage Month—a time to honor the history, culture, and ongoing contributions of Native peoples across the country. Here in the Snoqualmie Valley, this month holds special meaning as we live and work on the ancestral lands of the Snoqualmie Tribe.

  The Snoqualmie Tribe has cared for these lands since time immemorial, and their presence continues to shape the cultural and natural landscape of our community today. From advocacy for environmental stewardship to investments in healthcare, education, and public services, the Tribe’s leadership is felt across our region.

  Native communities have also played a vital role in shaping healthcare traditions. Long before modern medicine, Indigenous healing practices emphasized balance, prevention, and holistic wellbeing, which are values that continue to resonate in today’s patient-centered care. Native leaders and healthcare professionals bring these traditions forward, blending cultural wisdom with medical expertise to strengthen health outcomes for all.

  As we celebrate Native American Heritage Month, we invite our staff and community to:

  - Learn more about the Snoqualmie Indian Tribe by visiting [snoqualmietribe.us](https://snoqualmietribe.us/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
  - Explore the Ancestral Lands Movement, which encourages us all to recreate with respect, mindfulness, and acknowledgment of Tribal lands
  - Reflect on the many ways Indigenous peoples contribute to medicine, community wellbeing, and cultural life here in Washington and across the nation

  This month, and every month, we honor the Snoqualmie Tribe and Native peoples everywhere for their resilience, leadership, and commitment to community.
