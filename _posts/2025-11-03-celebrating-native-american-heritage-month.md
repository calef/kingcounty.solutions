During Native American Heritage Month each November, the Snoqualmie Valley celebrates the heritage, culture, and continuing contributions of its Native tribes, particularly the Snoqualmie Tribe. The tribe is recognized for its care for ancestral lands and its influence on the local cultural and natural environment. The tribe is also credited for its contributions to environmental stewardship, healthcare, education, and public services. Indigenous healing practices, which prioritize balance, prevention, and holistic wellbeing, have significantly influenced modern patient-centered care. The community is encouraged to learn more about the tribe and its contributions to medicine and wellbeing.
