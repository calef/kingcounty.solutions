  <h2 class="wp-block-heading">“The Navy saved my life first. Then VA did it again.”</h2>



  <p>When Navy Veteran Missina Schallus chose to have a double <a href="https://www.veteranshealthlibrary.va.gov/TestsTreatments/Cancer/3,83001" rel="noopener">mastectomy</a> (removal of breast tissue) in 2023, she didn’t have a <a href="https://www.veteranshealthlibrary.va.gov/Resources/VideoLibrary/142,82941_VA" rel="noopener">breast cancer</a> diagnosis, but she had a gut feeling due to her personal and family history.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>That decision, and her gut instinct, likely saved her life. </p>



  <p>“I had been going through high-risk monitoring for years,” she said, due to her previous cancers, radiation to her neck and chest, and her mother’s history. “Every mammogram led to another biopsy. My last one? Seven biopsies. I just couldn’t live in that constant cycle of fear and uncertainty anymore.” </p>



  <h2 class="wp-block-heading">“The Navy saved my life first. Then VA did it again”&nbsp;</h2>



  <p>Missina served 21 years in the Navy as a Yeoman-Flag Writer, rising to the rank of Chief. “I was headed down a path of trouble before I enlisted. The Navy gave me purpose, structure and a second family,” she said. “It shaped who I am and helped carry me through everything, even cancer.” </p>



  <p>In 2023, Schallus had a mastectomy at the Washington D.C. VA Medical Center. Her care team included what she termed “a team of angels.”</p>



  <p>A few weeks later, her doctor called with unexpected news: pathology showed early-stage <a href="https://news.va.gov/?s=breast+cancer">breast cancer</a>.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>“She told me she was proud of me, for listening to my body, for advocating for myself,” Schallus said. “That moment was validating and overwhelming all at once. I didn’t have to go through chemo or radiation because we had already removed the cancer during the mastectomy.” </p>



  <h2 class="wp-block-heading">“They saw me—not just a patient, but as a person”&nbsp;</h2>



  <p>Schallus describes her VA care as nothing short of extraordinary. </p>



  <p>VA plastic surgeons performed her breast implant procedure. Physician Assistant Kim Callaway “held my hand when I cried. She took every call, answered every message, talked me through every fear,” she said. “My nurse, Seblewongel Tessema, greeted me every time with warmth and asked about my kids. They didn’t just treat my diagnosis—they treated me.” </p>



  <p>A few months after surgery, Schallus had an emergency with her breast implant. It was the Friday after Thanksgiving, and she was out of town. She called Callaway in a panic. </p>



  <p>The experience led to physical and emotional challenges, including severe depression. “I was crying 10 times a day, trying to work full time and be a present mom,” she said. “I just couldn’t see the light.” </p>



  <p>Her VA providers continued to support her. They listened, adjusted her care and were there for her whenever she needed them. They helped get the emergency taken care of.</p>



  <p>“There is no cure for breast cancer’s emotional toll,” she said. “But when you have a team that validates your feelings, listens to your concerns and helps you reclaim your identity, it makes all the difference.” </p>



  <h2 class="wp-block-heading">“Survivorship means choosing to live”&nbsp;</h2>



  <p>Her story is one of resilience, but also one of learning to accept help. “As a woman Veteran, there’s this pressure to be strong all the time,” she said. “But I’ve learned that asking for help is strength. Vulnerability is courage.” </p>



  <p>Now, she sees survivorship as not just surviving cancer but choosing to truly live after it. “I’m embracing my new normal. I’ve found beauty in my scars, in my story, in this next chapter,” she said. She is now a six-time—four-different cancers—survivor (Hodgkin lymphoma, melanoma, papillary thyroid, and now breast cancer). </p>



  <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Women Veterans: Listen, advocate, ask for help </h2>



  <p>To other women Veterans, Schallus offers this: “Listen to your gut. You know your body better than anyone. Advocate fiercely for yourself, and surround yourself with providers who truly see you.” </p>



  <p>She encourages women Veterans to stay on top of their preventive care, especially <a href="https://www.veteranshealthlibrary.va.gov/TestsTreatments/Cancer/142,82533_VA" rel="noopener">mammograms and screenings</a>.</p>
