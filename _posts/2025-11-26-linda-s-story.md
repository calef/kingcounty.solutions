  **Participant Story: Linda’s Journey of Rediscovery**

  When Linda arrived at her first-ever retreat … after 30 years of living with cancer… she wasn’t sure what to expect. Encouraged by her social worker, **she came with hesitation but also a quiet hope**.

  During a support group, she heard something that transformed her relationship with her cancer medications. Another survivor shared, “Cancer is like a mushroom that wants to grow everywhere. My drugs help me build a fence around my garden.” **For Linda, this shifted her perspective from seeing her treatments as poison to seeing them as protection…**  **boundaries holding her safe**.

  Throughout the weekend, **Linda discovered a deeper resilience within herself** : the strength to bend without breaking, to keep moving when her body insisted it couldn’t take another step. She realized she has the power to let herself simply be, even when life feels messy or uncertain.

  A symbol that stayed with her was the butterfly… its slow becoming, its reminder that **transformation takes time, patience, and grace**. “My butterfly gives me the freedom to feel, to live, and to fly,” she shared.

  What touched her most was the honesty and connection among participants. “ **Because of what we were all walking through, we took our masks off,** ” she said. “I realized my feelings weren’t alien. I wasn’t alone.”

  For the first time in her life, Linda felt able to put into words the grief she carried about losing her breasts… a profound moment of release and recognition.

  Returning home, she holds onto one powerful truth:&nbsp; **_I have the right to be free in my own skin._**

  **Reflecting back, she offers this to others living with cancer: “I’m SO glad I went. This retreat truly changed my life and the way I live with my cancer.”**

Linda, a cancer survivor of 30 years, attended her first retreat with mixed feelings but left transformed. During a support group, she resonated with another participant's metaphor comparing cancer to a mushroom and medications as a protective fence around her garden. This insight helped her reframe her treatments from poison to protective boundaries. Throughout the weekend, Linda discovered newfound resilience, learning to embrace her feelings and to accept life's messiness. She connected deeply with others, sharing her grief about losing her breasts, which was a moment of profound release. A butterfly became her symbol of transformation, representing the time and grace needed for personal growth. Linda returned home with the empowering realization that she has the right to be free in her own skin. She encourages others facing cancer to join such retreats, expressing gratitude for how the experience changed her life and approach to living with cancer.
