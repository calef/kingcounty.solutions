Linda, a cancer survivor of 30 years, attended her first retreat with mixed feelings but left transformed. During a support group, she resonated with another participant's metaphor comparing cancer to a mushroom and medications as a protective fence around her garden. This insight helped her reframe her treatments from poison to protective boundaries. Throughout the weekend, Linda discovered newfound resilience, learning to embrace her feelings and to accept life's messiness. She connected deeply with others, sharing her grief about losing her breasts, which was a moment of profound release. A butterfly became her symbol of transformation, representing the time and grace needed for personal growth. Linda returned home with the empowering realization that she has the right to be free in her own skin. She encourages others facing cancer to join such retreats, expressing gratitude for how the experience changed her life and approach to living with cancer.
