Neighborhood House's 2025 Strategic Plan emphasizes its mission to promote equity and community well-being in King County amidst a challenging political environment marked by hostility toward immigrants and public funding threats. Following a 2023 Community Needs Assessment and a 2024 engagement process with clients and partners, the plan recognizes the growing demand for coordinated, culturally responsive services, particularly in South King County. Serving over 13,000 individuals annually, Neighborhood House aims to mobilize the community to address the root causes of poverty and inequity. The strategic plan focuses on using data to provide trauma-informed, culturally responsive access to housing, health, education, and economic opportunities. To achieve these goals, the organization is committed to investing in its staff and infrastructure while enhancing its capacity to drive systems-level change. Established over a century ago, Neighborhood House remains a vital service provider and advocate for individuals facing language, cultural, and systemic barriers, striving to support healthier, happier lives for all.
