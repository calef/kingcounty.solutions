  Friends,\n\nAs we step into 2025, I am deeply grateful for YOU, our community that
  embodies compassion, hope, and unwavering support for women experiencing homelessness
  on the Eastside.\n\nTogether, we accomplished so much in 2024! Your generosity provided
  shelter and safety to over 500 women. Through our emphasis on stability, over 120
  women found a place to call home and have a stable future.\n\nIn 2025, we are determined
  to continue supporting over 400 women annually. Achieving this ambitious goal will
  require all of us – our staff, partners, and you – to come together with determination
  and compassion. With your support, we will ensure women have access to safe shelter,
  personalized case management to rebuild their lives, and resources that empower
  them to lead stable lives.\n\nYour belief in our mission inspires us to do more!
  Thank you for walking alongside us and the women we serve.\n\nWith gratitude and
  hope,\n\nDietra Clayton  \n_Executive Director_\n\n> “Imagine being homeless in
  the winter, feeling depressed and suicidal. The Sophia Way rescued me from further
  trauma and deterioration. They gave me not only shelter, meals, snacks, hygiene
  supplies, and a bed but also a case manager who helped me regain my self-esteem
  and strengthen my self-worth. They provided support and a sense of belonging. They
  made me realize that I do matter!”  \n> – Rachel\n\n> \n\nThe post [Gratitude](https://sophiaway.org/gratitude-ny/)
