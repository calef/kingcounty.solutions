  <p><b>In honor of National Suicide Prevention Awareness Month, we’re sharing </b><b><i>Social Qs</i></b><b>: a series of open-hearted, reflective questions designed to foster connection, empathy, and conversation around mental health and suicide prevention. </b></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These questions aren’t meant to be clinical or too heavy-handed. Instead, they’re gentle invitations to reflect, share, and listen, whether in conversation with others or within yourself. Each one encourages honesty, compassion, and a deeper understanding of what it means to care for ourselves and each other through life’s hardest moments. </span></p>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use these Social Qs to spark meaningful conversations with family, friends, coworkers, or members of your community. Post them on social media. Journal your answers. Host a dialogue. However you engage, the goal is the same: to reduce stigma, build empathy, and remind one another that we are not alone.</span></p>
  <h2><b>How am I feeling right now–emotionally, physically, and mentally?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h2>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s okay to pause and ask yourself how you’re really doing. Self-awareness is the first step toward self-care. Take a deep breath. How do you feel at this moment? </span></p>
  <h2><b>Who in your life could you send a reminder to that you’re here for them?</b></h2>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sometimes the strongest people are the quietest about their struggles. Reach out to someone to let them know they matter to you.</span></p>
  <h2><b>What’s a memory with someone that still makes you smile? Could you share it with them today? </b></h2>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sharing joy strengthens bonds. Remind someone of a moment you’ll never forget. You might just make their day. </span></p>
  <h2><b>Am I speaking to myself with the same kindness I’d offer a friend? </b></h2>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Self-compassion isn’t selfish. It’s essential. Talk to yourself with the same care you’d give someone you love. What’s a trait you admire in yourself that’s uniquely you?</span></p>
  <h2><b>When I’m feeling low, who are my go-to people? When they’re feeling low, how can I be theirs?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></h2>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about your support circle. Reach out to let them know you’re there and appreciate that they’re there for you, too.</span></p>
  <h2><b>What’s one simple message you could send today to let someone know they matter? </b></h2>
  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t overthink it. “I’m thinking of you.” “You make my life better.” A small note like those can have a big impact. </span></p>

  **In honor of National Suicide Prevention Awareness Month, we’re sharing**  **_Social Qs_**** : a series of open-hearted, reflective questions designed to foster connection, empathy, and conversation around mental health and suicide prevention.&nbsp;**

  These questions aren’t meant to be clinical or too heavy-handed. Instead, they’re gentle invitations to reflect, share, and listen, whether in conversation with others or within yourself. Each one encourages honesty, compassion, and a deeper understanding of what it means to care for ourselves and each other through life’s hardest moments.&nbsp;

  Use these Social Qs to spark meaningful conversations with family, friends, coworkers, or members of your community. Post them on social media. Journal your answers. Host a dialogue. However you engage, the goal is the same: to reduce stigma, build empathy, and remind one another that we are not alone.

  ## **How am I feeling right now–emotionally, physically, and mentally?** &nbsp;

  It’s okay to pause and ask yourself how you’re really doing. Self-awareness is the first step toward self-care. Take a deep breath. How do you feel at this moment?&nbsp;

  ## **Who in your life could you send a reminder to that you’re here for them?**

  Sometimes the strongest people are the quietest about their struggles. Reach out to someone to let them know they matter to you.

  ## **What’s a memory with someone that still makes you smile? Could you share it with them today?&nbsp;**

  Sharing joy strengthens bonds. Remind someone of a moment you’ll never forget. You might just make their day.&nbsp;

  ## **Am I speaking to myself with the same kindness I’d offer a friend?&nbsp;**

  Self-compassion isn’t selfish. It’s essential. Talk to yourself with the same care you’d give someone you love. What’s a trait you admire in yourself that’s uniquely you?

  ## **When I’m feeling low, who are my go-to people? When they’re feeling low, how can I be theirs?** &nbsp;

  Think about your support circle. Reach out to let them know you’re there and appreciate that they’re there for you, too.

  ## **What’s one simple message you could send today to let someone know they matter?&nbsp;**

  Don’t overthink it. “I’m thinking of you.” “You make my life better.” A small note like those can have a big impact.&nbsp;

A simple question can significantly impact mental health and potentially save lives. Asking someone, “Are you okay?” can provide an opportunity for individuals struggling with emotional distress to open up about their feelings. This question serves as a prompt for deeper conversations and demonstrates genuine care and concern. Many people facing mental health challenges often feel isolated and unheard, making it crucial for friends, family, and colleagues to engage empathetically.

Research indicates that a supportive environment can encourage individuals to seek help and feel less alone. Training programs for mental health awareness emphasize the importance of active listening and validating feelings when someone shares their struggles. Recognizing the signs of distress and knowing how to ask the right questions can create a more supportive community.

By fostering open dialogues about mental health, society can reduce stigma and encourage those in need to reach out for assistance. Simple acts of kindness, like asking if someone is okay, can make a profound difference in their lives. Ending the silence surrounding mental health issues is essential for creating a culture of support and understanding.
