The U.S. Department of Justice announced an agreement with Northwestern University to resolve allegations of discrimination against pregnant students. The agreement follows a complaint filed by a former student who alleged that the university failed to provide necessary accommodations for her pregnancy-related needs. Under the terms of the agreement, Northwestern University will implement new policies to ensure that pregnant students receive appropriate accommodations, including adjustments to academic deadlines and attendance policies. The university will also provide training for staff on how to support pregnant students effectively. Additionally, Northwestern is required to report on its compliance with the agreement for three years. This initiative aims to enhance support for pregnant students and ensure they can continue their education without facing discrimination or undue hardship. The agreement reflects the commitment of the Justice Department to uphold the rights of pregnant individuals in educational settings and to promote equal opportunities for all students.
