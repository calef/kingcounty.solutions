title: 'Full Circle: Ben Moore’s Path to Medicine'
topics:
- Disabilities
- Education & Learning
- Health Care
---

Ben Moore's journey to medicine began in early childhood, participating in programs at what is now the Institute on Human Development and Disability (IHDD) at the University of Washington (UW). He later re-engaged with the UW community through the UW LEND program, initially as a self-advocate trainee. Leveraging his personal experiences with disability, he focused on advocacy and leadership, eventually becoming the self-advocate discipline lead, where he mentored trainees and emphasized the importance of self-advocate leadership.

After LEND, Moore pursued his passion for healthcare, starting with the Medical Assistant program at UW. Following its closure, he transferred to Pima Medical Institute (PMI) and began a clinical track in September 2024, rotating through various medical specialties. He aims to graduate in July 2026, with aspirations to support children and families in pediatrics and psychiatry. Moore is also seeking certifications to become a child psychiatric clinical assistant, combining his medical training with the values of collaboration and person-centered care he developed at LEND. His roles exemplify the mission of LEND, fostering professionals who bring empathy and lived experience to healthcare.
