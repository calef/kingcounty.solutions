Thank you to all who participated in the Sno-Valley Senior Center's Timeless Treasures Gala & Auction on October 11. The event, held at the Club at Snoqualmie Ridge, raised an impressive $62,000, including a record $30,100 from the Fund-A-Need segment. Donations can still be made online or at the center. Special thanks to the planning committee, including Alison Cook, Dawn Simmons, and others, as well as Event Coordinator Claire Foster, Auctioneer Austin Sheely, and Emcee Aliesha Pulliam. The ballroom was beautifully decorated with a pirate theme, and volunteers ensured smooth registration and auction operations. The dessert dash, coordinated by MJ Sanker and Shelley Cleary, raised over $11,000, contributing significantly to the event's success. Many volunteers were involved in procuring auction items, leading to record fundraising. Upcoming events include the Annual Veteran’s Day Breakfast on November 11 and a Steak Dinner & Pie Auction on November 22. For questions or comments, contact Kira Avery, Executive Director, at 425-333-4152 ext. 1 or via email.
