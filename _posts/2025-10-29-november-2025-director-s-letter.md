  <p>Thank you so much to all those who attended the Sno-Valley Senior Center Timeless Treasures Gala &amp; Auction at the Club at Snoqualmie Ridge on Saturday, October 11. Whether you donated an item, volunteered, came in person, or bid online, you had an impact. As of right now, it looks like we will net <b>$62,000 </b>in support of all the Timeless Treasures found at the Sno-Valley Senior center!<b><br />
  </b></p>
  <p>We raised <b>$30,100 </b>in the Fund-A-Need portion of the event, the most ever! If you want to contribute, you can still donate online, at the center, or by using the envelope; just put Fund-A-Need in the description!</p>
  <p>We really appreciate the committee who helped plan this event: Alison Cook, Dawn Simmons, MJ Sanker, Jane Hartwell, Kate Endicott, Shirley Davis, Shelley Cleary, &amp; Denise Crutchfield. We also received a lot of support from our Event Coordinator, Claire Foster; Auctioneer, Austin Sheely;  and the event Emcee, Aliesha Pulliam.</p>
  <p>The set-up and decorating crew did a wonderful job turning the ballroom into a pirate-themed venue. The registration &amp; check-in/check-out group of volunteers kept the lines moving and worked hard to make sure the data entry was accurate.</p>
  <p>The volunteers selling hidden treasure bottles, golden raffle tickets, and wine were excellent! We sold almost every single item in the silent auction and the volunteers kept everything organized and ready to go at the end of the night. Our greeters, assistants, bid recorders, and spotters were organized and personable.</p>
  <p>The dessert dash was a wonderful addition to the event, and a big thank you to MJ Sanker and Shelley Cleary for coordinating, as well as our bakers and donors who made it all possible. That alone brought in more than <b>$11,000</b>!</p>
  <p>Many of our volunteers also worked on procurement, with the silent and live auction items bringing in a record number raised.</p>
  <p>Thank you again to everyone who made this event possible, especially the Club at Snoqualmie Ridge for hosting us!</p>
  <p>We have several more events coming up before the end of the year, including the Annual Veteran’s Day Breakfast on Tuesday, November 11, and Steak Dinner &amp; Pie Auction, coming up on Saturday, November 22! We’ll be making baking calls here soon!</p>
  <p>As always, if you have questions, comments, or concerns please call me at 425-333-4152 ext. 1 or email kiraa@soundgenerations.org.</p>

Thank you to all who participated in the Sno-Valley Senior Center's Timeless Treasures Gala & Auction on Oct. 11. The event, held at the Club at Snoqualmie Ridge, raised an impressive $62,000, including a record $30,100 from the Fund-A-Need segment. Donations can still be made online or at the center. Special thanks to the planning committee, including Alison Cook, Dawn Simmons, and others, as well as event coordinator Claire Foster, auctioneer Austin Sheely, and emcee Aliesha Pulliam. The ballroom was beautifully decorated with a pirate theme, and volunteers ensured smooth registration and auction operations. The dessert dash, coordinated by MJ Sanker and Shelley Cleary, raised over $11,000, contributing significantly to the event's success. Many volunteers were involved in procuring auction items, leading to record fundraising. Upcoming events include the annual Veterans Day breakfast on Nov. 11 and a steak dinner and pie auction on Nov. 22. For questions or comments, contact Kira Avery, executive director, at 425-333-4152 ext. 1 or via email.
