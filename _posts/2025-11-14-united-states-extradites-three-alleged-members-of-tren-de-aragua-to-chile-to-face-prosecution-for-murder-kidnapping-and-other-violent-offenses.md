On September 30, 2025, the United States extradited three alleged members of the Venezuelan-based criminal organization Tren de Aragua (TdA) to Chile. The individuals, all of whom were living in the U.S. illegally, face serious charges, including homicide, kidnapping for ransom, and human smuggling. The Justice Department has designated TdA as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. 

The extradited individuals are:
- **Miguel Oyola Jimenez**, 38, a dual Venezuelan and Ecuadorian national, accused of directing kidnappings for ransom of migrant workers in Northern Chile.
- **Jesus Alberto Golding Escalona**, 34, a Venezuelan national, charged with aggravated murder linked to a human smuggling operation.
- **Edgar Javier Benitez Rubio**, 37, also a Venezuelan national, accused of kidnapping with homicide and involvement in the killing of a Venezuelan opposition figure.

Additionally, two more Venezuelan nationals, Gregoris Jose Cortez Fernandez and Yonaiker Gabriel Sequera Olivero, were extradited to face charges related to violent crimes. The extraditions were facilitated by various U.S. agencies and their Chilean counterparts, emphasizing a commitment to public safety and accountability.
