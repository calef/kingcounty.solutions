  <p>When Tina McDonough lost a close friend to cancer in 2007, she turned her heartbreak into a mission to bring hope and support to others. As the fearless founder of the local non-profit <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://valleygirlsandguys.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Valley Girls &amp; Guys</a></span></strong>, Tina has created a remarkable community that champions cancer patients and their families through every step of their courageous journey.  </p>



  <p>Valley Girls &amp; Guys brings together a growing network of survivors, caregivers, friends, and community supporters to create a circle of compassionate care that touches countless lives through its many programs and community initiatives. Tina and Valley Girls &amp; Guys impact is now profoundly visible at our new Cancer Center. At the ribbon-cutting celebration on Jan. 16, the new Infusion &amp; Immunotherapy Center was named “Tina McDonough &amp; Family Infusion &amp; Immunotherapy Center,” honoring Tina, her family, and Valley Girls &amp; Guys for their unwavering commitment to cancer care in our community.</p>



  <p><strong>Finding Purpose Through A Personal Journey</strong><br>“When people get cancer, they are so scared, so worried about what&#8217;s going to happen next,&#8221; Tina reflects on her own mother&#8217;s journey at Valley Medical Center in 2020. &#8220;When my mom was diagnosed, she had to navigate between different buildings for radiology, infusion, and doctor visits. At a time when patients and families are already overwhelmed, having to coordinate care across multiple locations adds another layer of stress and anxiety to their cancer journey.&#8221;</p>



  <p>This firsthand experience deepened Tina&#8217;s passion for easing the burden of families facing cancer. She understood that improving the cancer care journey wasn&#8217;t just about medical treatment—it was about creating a better, more supportive path for every patient and family.</p>



  <p><strong>Helping Make Valley’s Cancer Center a Reality</strong><br>Born from the spirit of neighbors helping neighbors, Valley Girls &amp; Guys is a driving force behind our new Cancer Center. Their historic $1.8 million donation in June 2023—chosen to represent the 1 in 8 women diagnosed with breast cancer—marked the first major gift toward the Center. Over the years their total commitment has grown to over $2.7 million, supporting patient care across the Center, including the Bridge of Hope, new infusion chairs, and the HOPE Patient Assistance Fund.</p>



  <p>&#8220;We wanted to be the forerunners in this,&#8221; Tina shares. &#8220;We wanted to be the people that said, &#8216;Yes, we&#8217;re in for the long haul with Valley Medical Center.&#8217; The new Cancer Center would not have saved my mom, but it would have changed how her cancer journey happened—to be all in one building and be surrounded by all the amazing people.&#8221;</p>



  <p><strong>Building a Community of Support</strong><br>Since 2007, Tina has poured her heart, boundless energy, and steadfast determination into creating meaningful change, such as the inspiring annual Be the Hope Walk which brings thousands together in a powerful show of support. Valley Girls &amp; Guys also extends help in many other ways—funding life-saving mammograms and vital cancer research, granting WHO dreams for terminal patients, and providing comfort through the Glenda Weiler Blankets of Comfort and Hope program. Every dollar raised directly benefits patients and their families where they live and receive treatment.</p>



  <p>&#8220;Valley Girls &amp; Guys is a force of love,&#8221; says Jeannine Erickson Grinnell, Valley Medical Center’s Chief Executive Officer &amp; Chief Financial Officer. &#8220;They embody our mission of &#8216;caring for our community like family.&#8217; Their commitment to &#8216;be the hope&#8217; for others makes South King County a better, kinder, more hopeful place.”</p>



  <p><strong>Creating Hope for the Future</strong><br>While her infectious optimism and tireless dedication have earned national recognition—including a place among Susan G. Komen&#8217;s 35 most influential leaders in the fight against breast cancer—Tina remains firmly rooted in her community.  </p>



  <p>Through her signature message #BeTheHopeXOXO, Tina reminds us that when neighbors come together with support and compassion, hope flourishes and healing begins. &#8220;Just be so grateful for what Valley’s Cancer Center stands for,&#8221; she shares, &#8220;because this is going to change and save people&#8217;s lives.”</p>

Tina McDonough founded the nonprofit Valley Girls & Guys after losing a close friend to cancer in 2007, aiming to support cancer patients and their families. The organization has built a compassionate community of survivors, caregivers, and supporters, significantly impacting local cancer care. In January 2024, the new Infusion & Immunotherapy Center was named in her honor, recognizing the group's dedication to improving cancer treatment experiences. Tina's personal journey, particularly her mother’s cancer experience in 2020, fueled her commitment to easing the burdens faced by families navigating treatment. Valley Girls & Guys has raised more than $2.7 million to enhance patient care at the new Cancer Center, including funding for vital resources like the HOPE Patient Assistance Fund and life-saving mammograms. Their initiatives, such as the annual Be the Hope Walk, unite the community in support of those affected by cancer. Tina’s efforts have earned her national recognition, yet she remains focused on her local community, emphasizing the importance of support and compassion in fostering hope and healing. Her message, encapsulated in #BeTheHopeXOXO, inspires collective action to improve lives and transform cancer care.
