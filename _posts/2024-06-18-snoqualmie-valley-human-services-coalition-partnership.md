  ![Snoqualmie Valley Human Services Coalition partner graphic.](https://empoweryouthnetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/legacy/2024/06/thumbnail_Coalition.png)Empower Youth Network (EYN) is a proud partner in the Snoqualmie Valley Human Services Coalition. The coalition is a group of organizations committed to working together differently to connect community members to the resources they need.

  The Sno-Valley is a geographically large area that spans well over 40 miles from North Bend to Duvall, including unincorporated areas. Residents living in suburban and rural areas often face more limited access to support and resources for meeting common or everyday needs for things like transportation, housing, mental health, and beyond. Removing barriers to accessing help means that service providers have to work with each other to make a change.

  EYN plays a role in removing these barriers by serving students and families—with community, collaboration and connection at the center of all that we do.
