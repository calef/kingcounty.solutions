title: Leader of White Supremacist Group Pleads Guilty to Soliciting Hate Crimes and
  Sending Instructions to Make Bombs and Ricin
topics: []
---

Georgian national Michail Chkhikvishvili, leader of the white supremacist group "Maniac Murder Cult," pleaded guilty to soliciting hate crimes and providing instructions for making bombs and ricin. His recruitment efforts aimed to incite violence against Jewish communities and racial minorities, including a planned mass casualty attack in New York City. Chkhikvishvishvili was extradited from Moldova in May 2025 after extensive investigations by the FBI and other agencies. He utilized the encrypted messaging app Telegram to encourage violent acts, including a horrific plot to poison children during the holidays.

His manifesto, the "Hater’s Handbook," promotes mass violence and has been linked to real-world attacks, such as a school shooting in Nashville and a stabbing in Turkey. Chkhikvishvishvili faces a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison. U.S. officials emphasized the ongoing threat posed by violent extremist groups and reaffirmed their commitment to protecting communities from hate-driven violence. The case highlights the collaboration of various law enforcement agencies in addressing domestic terrorism and safeguarding public safety.
