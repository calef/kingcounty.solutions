  <p>February 3, 2025, marks the beginning of a new era in cancer care as we welcome patients to Phase One of our comprehensive Cancer Center—a major step forward for South King County. Located in the East Pavilion on Valley&#8217;s main campus, this state-of-the-art facility will bring together our nationally recognized cancer programs and services. Coordinated care under one roof will make it much more convenient for our patients and their loved ones.</p>



  <p>&#8220;Cancer is the #1 cause of death in our community,&#8221; shares Jeannine Erickson Grinnell, Chief Executive Officer &amp; Chief Financial Officer at Valley. &#8220;Here in South King County, where we serve more than 600,000 residents, patients and families deserve comprehensive cancer care without having to commute to Seattle or Tacoma. They deserve access to advanced treatment options and support services. Most importantly, they deserve a place of hope and healing where their care is truly coordinated.&#8221;</p>



  <p>The timing is critical. We&#8217;ve seen a 25% increase in cancer patients over the past five years. As our Southeast King County population continues to grow, so does the need for cancer care close to home. We are proud that our accredited Infusion &amp; Immunotherapy Center will be able to welcome and treat 40% more patients than ever before. Those patients will be able to receive chemotherapy, blood treatments, and targeted biotherapy. The Center will also serve patients who need infusion therapy for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, chronic headaches, and multiple sclerosis.</p>



  <p>The first phase also marks the opening of an Acute Symptom Management Clinic, an Infusion Pharmacy, FastTrack infusion treatment rooms, and the Trapper &amp; Samantha Wellbeing Resource Center.</p>



  <p>A cornerstone of our Cancer Center is our complete approach to patient care. Patients will have access to our full network of support, including patient navigators, oncology social workers, and free services through partners like Cancer Lifeline. These services cover a wide range of needs, from nutrition guidance and wellness classes, to support groups and more. We&#8217;ve also made it easier for patients to connect with their care team through modern conveniences like telehealth visits and MyChart, where they can schedule appointments and access test results.</p>



  <p>At the heart of our Cancer Center program is a specialized medical team. &#8220;During a patient&#8217;s cancer journey, our specialists create an individualized treatment plan. Their care team may include medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, surgeons, and other specialty clinicians who collaborate to provide the best possible care,&#8221; says Navanshu Arora, MD, Associate Medical Director for Cancer Services.</p>



  <p>&#8220;Valley is accredited by the Commission on Cancer as a Community Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Program,&#8221; Grinnell notes. &#8220;This recognition reflects our commitment to providing the highest quality care, and our new Cancer Center strengthens this commitment to our community.”</p>



  <p>Our Cancer Center&#8217;s development is funded by three main sources: strategic partnerships for the building and parking garage; hospital Board-designated capital funding; and widespread support from nonprofit organizations, our staff and clinician donors, and community members.</p>

  <p>&#8220;Our community inspired this project and is helping make it possible,&#8221; says Grinnell, highlighting the vital role of community support. She recognizes Valley Girls &amp; Guys, a group of local cancer thrivers and loved ones led by fearless founder Tina McDonough and her Board. &#8220;They stood beside us, lifted us up when we struggled, and gave us the hope to make this happen.&#8221;</p>



  <p>As a public district hospital, we ensure cancer care is accessible to all who need it. &#8220;We want our community to receive excellent care close to home, from people they know and trust,&#8221; Grinnell reflects. &#8220;While we hope you never need us, we&#8217;re here if you do.&#8221;</p>



  <p>Looking ahead, our next phase will include an Oncology &amp; Hematology Clinic, a Multidisciplinary Clinic for team collaboration, and a Laboratory. Our vision for comprehensive cancer care will be completed with a welcoming Café space for families, Radiation Oncology and support facilities in future expansion plans.</p>



  <p>Your continued support is essential as we work to raise the remaining $45 million needed to complete the Cancer Center&#8217;s next phase. &#8220;The Cancer Center represents more than a building—it&#8217;s our commitment to fighting cancer with advanced medicine and unwavering support for patients and their families,&#8221; Grinnell adds.</p>
