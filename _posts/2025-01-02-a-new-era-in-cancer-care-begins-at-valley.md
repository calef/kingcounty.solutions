February 3, 2025, marks the opening of Phase One of Valley Medical Center's new comprehensive Cancer Center in South King County, designed to accommodate 40% more patients. This state-of-the-art facility will centralize nationally recognized cancer programs and services, providing patients with convenient access to advanced treatment options without the need to travel to Seattle or Tacoma. The region has seen a 25% increase in cancer patients over the past five years, emphasizing the need for localized care.

The facility includes an accredited Infusion & Immunotherapy Center, an Acute Symptom Management Clinic, and various support services such as patient navigators and wellness classes. Patients will benefit from a collaborative care model involving a specialized medical team that includes oncologists and other specialists. Funding for the center comes from strategic partnerships, hospital funding, and community support.

Future phases will expand services to include additional clinics and facilities. The Cancer Center represents a commitment to fighting cancer with advanced medicine and comprehensive support for patients and their families, reinforcing the hospital's dedication to accessible care within the community.
