Dani Yovine, an electrical engineer associate at Seattle City Light (SCL), has been with the organization for nearly three years. As part of the Generation team, Yovine contributes to the planning, design, construction, operation, and maintenance of hydroelectric generation facilities. They appreciate the variety in their daily work, which includes both office tasks and travel to powerhouses.

Originally from Buenos Aires, Argentina, Yovine studied electrical engineering at the Universidad de Buenos Aires. They live with their partner, Gabi, and their dog, Leia, whom they adopted seven years ago. Yovine enjoys outdoor activities like hiking and paddleboarding, as well as brewing beer and cooking with friends. They also enjoy board games and are currently playing a campaign of "Dungeons & Dragons."

Yovine admires their younger self's tenacity and ability to dream big, which led them to fulfill their aspiration of working in hydroelectricity. A fan of soccer, they support Argentina during the World Cup, and they resonate with the positive and service-oriented nature of their coworkers, akin to the character Leslie Knope from "Parks & Recreation."
