Cranberry Linzer cookies are a delightful twist on the traditional Linzer cookie, featuring a sweet and tart cranberry filling. To make these cookies, a buttery dough is prepared with flour, almond flour, powdered sugar, and spices, then rolled out and cut into shapes. A unique cranberry filling is made by cooking fresh or frozen cranberries with sugar and spices until thickened. Once the cookies are baked and cooled, they are filled with the cranberry mixture, and a dusting of powdered sugar is added for a festive touch. These cookies make a perfect treat for the holiday season, offering a combination of flavors and textures that will impress guests. The recipe is easy to follow and can be adapted with different fillings, making it a versatile option for any occasion. Cranberry Linzer cookies not only taste great but also look beautiful, adding a charming element to holiday dessert tables.
