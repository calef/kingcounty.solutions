  Ms. White is a lifelong resident of Seattle’s Central District, born in the very house where she now lives with her children, Apraisjah and Calvontre, and her grandson, Ar’Quez. Theirs is a remarkable second-generation Boyer story: Calvontre was born prematurely and without hearing. He received Early Services during his earliest years, and Ms. White credits Boyer with giving him the strong foundation he needed to succeed. When Calvontre was a toddler, surgery restored his hearing, and he has only continued to thrive. Now a recent high school graduate, he’s preparing to begin his next chapter at Central Washington University.

  When Ar’Quez’s mom, Apraisjah, noticed some developmental delays, the family got back in touch with Boyer. Today Ar’Quez receives home visits from his care team, including Nancy (Occupational Therapist), Stella (Speech Therapist), Emily (Early Childhood Educator) and Mike (Family Resources Coordinator). When speaking about his nephew receiving care at Boyer, Calvontre says, “I know he’s in good hands!” Ms. Whitebeams with pride when describing his curiosity and eagerness to try new things. “I’m most excited to watch Ar’Quez grow!” she says.

Ms. White, a lifelong resident of Seattle's Central District, lives in the same home where she was born, along with her children, Apraisjah and Calvontre, and her grandson, Ar’Quez. This family story highlights a second-generation connection to Boyer Children's Clinic. Calvontre, born prematurely and without hearing, benefited from Early Services provided by Boyer, which Ms. White credits for his success. After undergoing surgery in toddlerhood to restore his hearing, Calvontre has thrived and is now a recent high school graduate preparing to attend Central Washington University. 

When Apraisjah noticed developmental delays in Ar’Quez, the family reconnected with Boyer. Currently, Ar’Quez receives home visits from a dedicated care team, which includes an Occupational Therapist, Speech Therapist, Early Childhood Educator, and Family Resources Coordinator. Calvontre expresses confidence in the care his nephew is receiving, stating, “I know he’s in good hands!” Ms. White expresses pride in Ar’Quez's curiosity and eagerness to learn, sharing her excitement to watch him grow.
