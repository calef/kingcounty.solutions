Ms. White, a lifelong resident of Seattle's Central District, lives in the same home where she was born, along with her children, Apraisjah and Calvontre, and her grandson, Ar’Quez. This family story highlights a second-generation connection to Boyer Children's Clinic. Calvontre, born prematurely and without hearing, benefited from Early Services provided by Boyer, which Ms. White credits for his success. After undergoing surgery in toddlerhood to restore his hearing, Calvontre has thrived and is now a recent high school graduate preparing to attend Central Washington University. 

When Apraisjah noticed developmental delays in Ar’Quez, the family reconnected with Boyer. Currently, Ar’Quez receives home visits from a dedicated care team, which includes an Occupational Therapist, Speech Therapist, Early Childhood Educator, and Family Resources Coordinator. Calvontre expresses confidence in the care his nephew is receiving, stating, “I know he’s in good hands!” Ms. White expresses pride in Ar’Quez's curiosity and eagerness to learn, sharing her excitement to watch him grow.
