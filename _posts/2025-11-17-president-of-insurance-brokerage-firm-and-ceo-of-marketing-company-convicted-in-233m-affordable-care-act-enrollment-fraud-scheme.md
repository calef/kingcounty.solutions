A federal jury in West Palm Beach, Florida, convicted Cory Lloyd, president of an insurance brokerage firm, and Steven Strong, CEO of a marketing company, for their involvement in a fraudulent scheme targeting Affordable Care Act (ACA) subsidies. The defendants sought over $233 million in fraudulent enrollments, resulting in at least $180 million paid by the federal government. They submitted false applications for ACA plans to enroll individuals whose incomes did not qualify for subsidies, exploiting vulnerable populations including those facing financial hardship and mental health issues. Lloyd received commissions from insurers for enrollments, while Strong received referral fees. Evidence showed they used deceptive sales tactics and coached applicants on how to misrepresent their income. They also bribed individuals to induce enrollments and manipulated the system to maximize their commissions. Both were convicted of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and other charges, facing significant prison sentences. Sentencing is scheduled for February 4, 2026. The investigation was led by the FBI, HHS-OIG, and IRS-CI, highlighting ongoing efforts to combat health care fraud.
