  <h2>The person was infected with the H5N5 virus; the risk to the public remains low</h2>

  <p><strong>OLYMPIA</strong> – A Grays Harbor County resident who was undergoing treatment for H5N5 avian influenza died today. The Washington State Department of Health offers its heartfelt condolences to the person’s family and friends.</p>

  <p>The person was an older adult with underlying health conditions. Out of respect for the family’s privacy, we are not releasing their name, gender, or age. The person had been hospitalized in King County since early November.</p>

  <p>Testing at the UW Medicine Clinical Virology Lab identified the virus as H5N5, making this the first recorded infection with this variant in a person globally. The result was confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>

  <p><strong>The risk to the public remains low. No other people involved have tested positive for avian influenza. Public health officials will continue to monitor anyone who was in close contact with the patient for symptoms to ensure that human-to-human spread has not occurred.

  <p>The person had a backyard flock of mixed domestic birds. DOH testing identified avian influenza virus in the environment of the flock, making exposure to the domestic poultry, their environment, or wild birds the most likely source of exposure for this patient.

A Grays Harbor County resident has died from complications related to the H5N5 avian influenza virus, marking the first recorded human infection of this variant globally. The individual, an older adult with underlying health conditions, had been hospitalized since early November. The Washington State Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the infection, which was identified at the UW Medicine Clinical Virology Lab and validated by the CDC. While the situation is concerning, the DOH states that the public risk remains low, with no evidence of human-to-human transmission. The deceased had a backyard flock of mixed domestic birds, and testing revealed the presence of the avian influenza virus in their environment, suggesting exposure likely occurred through contact with domestic poultry or wild birds. Individuals who had close contact with the patient are being monitored for symptoms. Public health officials advise that those with backyard poultry avoid contact with sick or dead birds and report any poultry illness. Additionally, it is recommended that people exposed to birds receive the seasonal flu vaccine, which can help mitigate the risk of simultaneous infections with both human and avian influenza viruses.
