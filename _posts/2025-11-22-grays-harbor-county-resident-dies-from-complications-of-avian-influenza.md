A Grays Harbor County resident has died from complications related to the H5N5 avian influenza virus, marking the first recorded human infection of this variant globally. The individual, an older adult with underlying health conditions, had been hospitalized since early November. The Washington State Department of Health (DOH) confirmed the infection, which was identified at the UW Medicine Clinical Virology Lab and validated by the CDC. While the situation is concerning, the DOH states that the public risk remains low, with no evidence of human-to-human transmission. The deceased had a backyard flock of mixed domestic birds, and testing revealed the presence of the avian influenza virus in their environment, suggesting exposure likely occurred through contact with domestic poultry or wild birds. Individuals who had close contact with the patient are being monitored for symptoms. Public health officials advise that those with backyard poultry avoid contact with sick or dead birds and report any poultry illness. Additionally, it is recommended that people exposed to birds receive the seasonal flu vaccine, which can help mitigate the risk of simultaneous infections with both human and avian influenza viruses.
