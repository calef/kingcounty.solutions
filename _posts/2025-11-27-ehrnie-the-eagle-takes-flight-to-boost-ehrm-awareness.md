EHRnie the Eagle has been introduced as a mascot to promote awareness of the Department of Veterans Affairs' Electronic Health Record Modernization (EHRM) program. EHRnie aims to engage Veterans and staff while providing information about the new electronic health records system. The mascot is part of a broader initiative to ensure that users understand the benefits and functionalities of the EHRM, which is designed to improve patient care and streamline processes. The VA is committed to enhancing the healthcare experience for Veterans by transitioning to this modernized system. EHRnie will be featured at various events, helping to demystify the changes and encourage feedback from users. The initiative emphasizes the importance of communication and collaboration within the VA community to ensure a successful implementation of the electronic health records. By using a friendly and relatable character, the VA hopes to foster a positive environment around the transition to the EHRM, making it easier for Veterans and staff to adapt to the new system.
