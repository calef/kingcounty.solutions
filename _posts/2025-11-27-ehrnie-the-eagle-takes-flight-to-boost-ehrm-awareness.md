EHRnie the Eagle has been introduced as a mascot to promote awareness of the Department of Veterans Affairs' Electronic Health Record Modernization (EHRM) initiative. This initiative aims to improve health care for veterans by modernizing the health record system. EHRnie, a friendly eagle, will be featured in various outreach activities, including events, social media campaigns, and educational materials to engage veterans and staff in understanding the benefits of the new system. The initiative is part of a broader commitment to provide high-quality care and improve the overall experience for veterans. EHRnie's role is to foster a sense of community and encourage feedback from veterans and their families about their health care experiences. By raising awareness and providing information, EHRnie aims to support the successful implementation of the EHRM, ensuring that veterans receive the best possible care through a more streamlined and efficient health record system. The mascot's engaging presence is expected to resonate with veterans and help them feel more connected to the changes in the health care delivery model.
