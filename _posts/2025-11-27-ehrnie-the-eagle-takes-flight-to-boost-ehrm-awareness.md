EHRNiE the Eagle, a new mascot for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), has been introduced to promote awareness of the Electronic Health Record Modernization (EHRM) program. EHRNiE aims to engage veterans and VA employees, highlighting the benefits of the new electronic health record system. The mascot's name stands for "Electronic Health Record New Initiative for Everyone" and symbolizes the VA's commitment to enhancing healthcare for veterans.

EHRNiE made its debut at a recent event, engaging with attendees and sharing information about the EHRM program. The VA emphasizes that this modernization effort will improve healthcare delivery by providing a more streamlined and efficient way to access and manage health records. EHRNiE will be featured at various VA events and initiatives to facilitate conversations about the transition to the new system.

Through this initiative, the VA aims to ensure that veterans are informed and prepared for the upcoming changes in their healthcare records management, ultimately leading to improved patient care and experiences. EHRNiE represents a fun and engaging approach to encourage dialogue and understanding of the EHRM program among the veteran community and stakeholders.
