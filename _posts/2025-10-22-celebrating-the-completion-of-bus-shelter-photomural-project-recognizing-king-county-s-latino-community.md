On October 4, King County Metro celebrated the dedication of two new bus shelters adorned with photo murals that honor the Latino community. The event took place at El Centro de la Raza, featuring Oaxacan music, dancers from Grupo Cultural Oaxaqueño, and traditional food like tamales and atole. The murals include the artwork of Mexican American artist Fulgencio Lazo, whose painting “Mercado de Bicicletas” symbolizes Metro's commitment to accessible transportation. Lazo reflected on his journey as an immigrant and the significance of sharing his art at the same bus stop he once used. The project, a collaboration between Metro and Latino Northwest Communications, showcases diverse Latin American cultures through various installations across the region. These include photographs capturing traditional dances and celebrations such as the Fiestas Patrias Parade and Día de los Muertos. The initiative is part of Metro’s Bus Shelter Mural Program, which aims to transform over 1,200 bus shelters into vibrant public art spaces, while also promoting sustainable transportation and community engagement through culturally relevant artwork.
