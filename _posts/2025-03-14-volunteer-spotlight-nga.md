For March, Nga is recognized as the volunteer spotlight for her contributions at Senior Meals, where she wraps and distributes bread and pastries. She discovered Hunger Intervention Program (HIP) while attending classes at the Lake City Senior Center and immediately offered to help upon seeing the need for volunteers. Nga quickly became familiar with the Senior Meals program, impressing the Volunteer Coordinator, Zahraa, with her kindness and helpfulness. Although she visits the meal site to enjoy a meal, Nga often volunteers to help serve when there are shortages of staff. She expresses her enjoyment of working with HIP, appreciating the kindness and cheerfulness of the team, which inspires her to embody the same spirit. She values her time volunteering, stating it enriches her life despite her busy schedule and has allowed her to meet many wonderful people at HIP. The organization expresses gratitude for Nga's generosity and kindness, noting how fortunate they are to have her as a volunteer.
