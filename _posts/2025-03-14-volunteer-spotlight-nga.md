  For March, we want to highlight Nga, who helps wrap and distribute bread and pastries at Senior Meals. Nga mentioned that HIP is the only volunteer work she does and we couldn’t be more happy to have her spend her time and energy here!

  Nga learned of HIP while attending classes at the Lake City Senior Center and came across the volunteers and HIP staff.&nbsp; While seeing how busy we were, she asked if she could help, and was directed to the bread table. The rest was history! She soon learned the ins and outs of the Senior Meals&nbsp;program and our Volunteer Coordinator, Zahraa, often mentioned how kind and helpful Nga was when she first came to help serve. Although Nga comes to the meal site to enjoy a meal, she often insists on helping serve if we are short on volunteers.

  When asked why she likes working with HIP she beautifully says “Working with them is so pleasant. Everyone is kind, they do each job with care and cheerfulness. Their actions encourage me to be like them. I have many things I need to do, but taking some time to volunteer at HIP [is] worth it. It enriches life, even though they are just small jobs. Also, I met many good people at HIP, and that is my reward.”

  Thank you so much Nga for taking the time out of your day to help despite your busy schedule. Your kindness and generosity are never lost on us, we’re so lucky to have you!

For March, Nga is recognized as the volunteer spotlight for her contributions at Senior Meals, where she wraps and distributes bread and pastries. She discovered Hunger Intervention Program (HIP) while attending classes at the Lake City Senior Center and immediately offered to help upon seeing the need for volunteers. Nga quickly became familiar with the Senior Meals program, impressing the Volunteer Coordinator, Zahraa, with her kindness and helpfulness. Although she visits the meal site to enjoy a meal, Nga often volunteers to help serve when there are shortages of staff. She expresses her enjoyment of working with HIP, appreciating the kindness and cheerfulness of the team, which inspires her to embody the same spirit. She values her time volunteering, stating it enriches her life despite her busy schedule and has allowed her to meet many wonderful people at HIP. The organization expresses gratitude for Nga's generosity and kindness, noting how fortunate they are to have her as a volunteer.
