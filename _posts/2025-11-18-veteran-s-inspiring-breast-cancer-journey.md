  <p>“I was one of those lost souls from a broken family,” said Suzanne Clark, a Navy and Army Veteran and breast cancer survivor. “The military was a way for me to save myself without being a burden to society. It was about survival.”&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Clark’s journey began in the Navy, where she worked in aviation, maintenance control and on the flightline launching planes. Later, she served in the Army Reserve as a radioman. But her toughest battle came years later, not in uniform, but in a doctor’s office. </p>



  <p>In 2020, after a routine <a href="https://news.va.gov/138863/new-breast-cancer-screening-recommendations/">mammogram</a>, Clark performed a self-exam and discovered a lump.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>“I felt a small lump and assumed it was a cyst,” Clark said. “By that Friday, I called VA and scheduled an appointment.”&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Clark shared, “All this took place during COVID—the ultrasound, biopsy and the call with the diagnosis. I was alone when I received the news.” </p>



  <p>Despite feeling isolated, Clark said that her care team immediately stepped up, “From my primary care provider to oncology, nutrition and mental health, everyone was on my side within a month.”</p>



  <p>Clark was diagnosed with triple-negative invasive ductal carcinoma, stage three. After undergoing a double mastectomy and revision surgery, she is now four years cancer-free. “I’m not a quitter,” she expressed. “Every day I wake up is a new day to be a better person.” </p>



  <p>Clark credits VA’s Women Veterans Program for helping her heal—physically and emotionally. “The Women’s Clinic has been phenomenal. They’re proactive instead of reactive. They follow up when you think you’re done, and they genuinely care,” she added. </p>

  <p>“Clark’s journey is a reflection of what happens when Veterans receive compassionate, specialized care,” said Theresa Zephirin, Women Veterans Program Manager at the Orlando VA Healthcare System. “Our women Veterans deserve care that recognizes their unique needs. Suzanne’s story highlights the strength and resilience within every Veteran and the importance of ensuring they feel supported at every stage of their care.” </p>



  <p>Clark now advocates for other female Veterans through the Vietnam and All Veterans of Central Florida organization, known as “The Bunker.”&nbsp;</p>



  <p>“Some of our members do not receive their care at VA, mostly Vietnam-era Veterans,” Clark said. “But when they saw the care I received, several decided to come. That’s the impact we can have on each other.”&nbsp;</p>

Two veterans, Angela and Tonia, have formed a powerful bond through their shared experiences battling breast cancer. Both women, who served in the military, found support in each other during their treatment journeys. Angela was diagnosed in 2017 and faced aggressive treatment, while Tonia received her diagnosis in 2020. They met at a VA facility, where they connected over their cancer experiences and the challenges of being veterans.

Their friendship has flourished as they have supported each other through surgeries, chemotherapy, and recovery. They emphasize the importance of mental health and the need for support systems for veterans facing health crises. Both women are advocates for breast cancer awareness and encourage other veterans to seek help and share their stories. They also highlight the significance of regular screenings and early detection in improving outcomes.

Angela and Tonia’s resilience and commitment to helping others have inspired many within the veteran community. They continue to raise awareness about breast cancer and emphasize the strength found in community and shared experiences, demonstrating that no one has to face their battles alone.
