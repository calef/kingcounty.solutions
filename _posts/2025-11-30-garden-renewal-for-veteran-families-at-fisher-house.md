Veteran families at the Fisher House in Houston have benefited from a garden renewal project aimed at enhancing their experience during challenging times. This initiative, led by the nonprofit organization Project Evergreen, involves refurbishing outdoor spaces to create therapeutic gardens. The gardens provide a peaceful environment for families to relax, reflect, and connect with nature while their loved ones receive medical care.

Volunteers from the community, including local garden clubs and organizations, have come together to support this effort by planting flowers, shrubs, and trees and improving the overall landscape. The project not only beautifies the area but also offers families a place to bond and share experiences in a serene setting. The renewed gardens are expected to play a vital role in the emotional well-being of veterans and their families, providing a comforting space away from the stress of hospital visits. Project Evergreen aims to expand similar initiatives across various locations, promoting recovery and resilience through nature-focused community engagement.
