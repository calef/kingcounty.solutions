On June 27, 2024, the Vashon Water Taxi service celebrated its new midday service, officially launched on July 1, 2024, with a special trip from Vashon Island to Seattle. The service expansion added four midday roundtrips, increasing the total to ten roundtrips daily. This improvement allows residents to access work, education, medical services, and tourism opportunities more easily. Since the service began, ridership has surged by 55% compared to the previous year, indicating strong community support. Funding for the expansion was secured through efforts by local residents and state legislators, including Senator Emily Alvarado and County Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda, highlighting the successful advocacy for improved transportation options. By mid-2025, the service averaged over 11,750 passengers monthly, with special weekend sailings added during events like the Vashon Strawberry Festival. Funding has also been approved to continue the midday service through June 2027, with plans for potential expansion beyond weekdays. Starting September 1, fares will increase to $7.00 for adults, with discounts available for seniors and low-income passengers. The service aims to enhance local connectivity and support the community's economic health.
