Encompass, an organization serving children of all abilities in Snoqualmie Valley, has transformed its mission statement into a purpose statement as part of its new strategic plan, Encompass 2030. The purpose statement, "The purpose of Encompass is to improve the well-being of children by partnering with families and the community," was designed to be more immediate and personal than the prior mission statement. The organization aims to nurture every aspect of a child's development, from physical health to emotional resilience and sense of belonging, by offering services like early intervention, pediatric therapy, mental health support, and early learning programs. By 2030, Encompass aims to extend this support to at least half of the children in surrounding areas.
