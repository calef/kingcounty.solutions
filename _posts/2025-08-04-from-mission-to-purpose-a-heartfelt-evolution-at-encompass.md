  \ \n_By Kim Darby, Encompass Board President, and Nela Cumming, Encompass Executive
  Director_\n\n![](https://encompassnw.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/img-instagram-blog-purpose-819x1024.jpg)In
  2024, the Encompass Board of Directors embarked on a journey—one rooted in reflection,
  community, and hope for the future. Our goal was to chart a bold and thoughtful
  course for the next five years. To do this, we formed a strategic planning committee
  made up of board members and staff leaders. Together, we listened to voices from
  across our community — families, staff, and partners — and studied data that revealed
  both the challenges and the opportunities ahead.\n\nThis collective effort led to
  the creation of our new strategic plan:&nbsp; **Encompass 2030**.\n\n**From Mission
  to Purpose**\n\nAs part of our planning process, we revisited our mission and vision.
  We asked ourselves:&nbsp;_Are these words still true to who we are? Do they reflect
  the heart of our work and the needs of our community?_\n\nWhat emerged was a powerful
  realization. While our mission had served us well, we needed something more immediate.
  A statement that could live in every interaction, every decision, every child’s
  story.\n\nSo, we made a meaningful shift: from a&nbsp; **mission statement** &nbsp;to
  a&nbsp; **purpose statement**.\n\n**Why a Purpose Statement?**\n\nMission statements
  can sometimes feel abstract or distant. But purpose? Purpose is personal. It’s the
  heartbeat of an organization. It answers the question:&nbsp;_Why does Encompass
  exist?_\n\nOur former mission, “Encompass partners with families to build healthy
  foundations for children,” has evolved into a clearer purpose: **“The purpose of
  Encompass is to improve the well-being of children by partnering with families and
  the community.”**\n\n**What Does “Well-Being” Really Mean?**\n\nThe word “well-being”
  may seem simple, but for us, it carries deep meaning. It reflects the whole child:
  their physical health, emotional resilience, developmental growth, and sense of
  belonging.\n\nAt Encompass, we serve children of all abilities, from birth through
  elementary school. Whether we’re providing early intervention, pediatric therapy,
  mental health support, or early learning programs, our goal is always the same:
  to nurture every aspect of a child’s development.\n\n“Well-being” captures this
  holistic vision. It’s not just about where a child starts; it’s about where they
  can go, and who they can become.\n\n**The Power of Partnership**\n\nWe know that
  children don’t grow in isolation. They thrive when their families, caregivers, and
  communities are supported. That’s why our purpose centers on&nbsp; **partnership**.\n\nOur
  tagline, “_Children. Families. Community.”,_ is more than a slogan. It’s a promise.
  We believe that parents and caregivers are a child’s first and most important teachers.
  We’re here to walk alongside them, offering tools, encouragement, and care every
  step of the way. When we partner with families and communities, we create a circle
  of support that surrounds each child with love, strength, and possibility.\n\n**Purpose
  and Vision: Hand in Hand**\n\nWhile our purpose has evolved, our vision remains
  steadfast:\n\n**“A community where ALL children thrive.”**\n\nThis vision is our
  north star for our purpose of improving the well-being of children.&nbsp; &nbsp;Partnership
  is the path that leads us there. We believe that our purpose will lead us to our
  vision by keeping our focus on the unique needs of the child, in partnership with
  their family and with the support of their community.\n\n**Encompass 2030 and Beyond**\n\nWith
  Encompass 2030, we’re setting our sights on a future where every child in the Snoqualmie
  Valley has access to the support they need and where at least half of the children
  in surrounding areas can benefit from our programs by 2030.\n\nWe’re committed to
  expanding services like Early Support for Infants and Toddlers (ESIT), Community-Based
  Pediatric Therapy, and Mental Health programs because we know the need is great
  and growing.\n\nBefore we launch any new service, we ask ourselves three guiding
  questions:\n\n- Does this service meet a real community need that supports children’s
  well-being?\n- Is Encompass the right organization to provide it?\n- Do we have
  the resources to do it well?\n\nThese questions keep us grounded in our purpose
  and focused on impact.\n\n**Looking Ahead with Heart**\n\nFor nearly 60 years, Encompass
  has been a trusted partner to families in our community. We’ve celebrated milestones,
  weathered challenges, and grown alongside the children and families we serve.\n\nAs
  we look to the future, our purpose will continue to guide us. It’s more than a statement;
  it’s a commitment. A commitment to every child’s well-being. A commitment to families.
  A commitment to the community.\n\nAnd most of all, it’s a commitment to generations
  to come.\n\nThe post [From Mission to Purpose: A Heartfelt Evolution at Encompass](https://encompassnw.org/from-mission-to-purpose-a-heartfelt-evolution-at-encompass/)

Encompass, an organization serving children of all abilities in Snoqualmie Valley, has transformed its mission statement into a purpose statement as part of its new strategic plan, Encompass 2030. The purpose statement, "The purpose of Encompass is to improve the well-being of children by partnering with families and the community," was designed to be more immediate and personal than the prior mission statement. The organization aims to nurture every aspect of a child's development, from physical health to emotional resilience and sense of belonging, by offering services like early intervention, pediatric therapy, mental health support, and early learning programs. By 2030, Encompass aims to extend this support to at least half of the children in surrounding areas.
