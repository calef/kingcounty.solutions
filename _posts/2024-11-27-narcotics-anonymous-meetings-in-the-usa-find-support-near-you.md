Narcotics Anonymous (NA) is a nonprofit organization providing a peer-led support network for individuals struggling with drug addiction. Established in the 1950s, NA utilizes a 12-step model similar to Alcoholics Anonymous, focusing on mutual support and shared experiences. With over 70,000 meetings globally, NA offers free, confidential gatherings where members can seek help and share their struggles without judgment. 

Meetings are available in major cities and smaller communities across the U.S., catering to those wishing to stop using drugs. Participants can attend open meetings, accessible to anyone, or closed meetings, restricted to individuals who identify as having a drug problem. 

NA's 12 steps guide members through self-reflection, personal growth, and spiritual awakening, fostering accountability and community. To find local NA meetings, individuals can use online resources, which offer options for in-person and virtual participation. First-time attendees are encouraged to arrive early, introduce themselves, and share their experiences if comfortable. Members receive keychain tags to acknowledge their recovery milestones, symbolizing their commitment and progress in sobriety.
