The Snoqualmie Indian Tribe has donated over $1 million to various nonprofit organizations in Washington State, with a focus on arts and culture, native services, family and veterans services, environmental education, and community services. The tribe also donated $130,000 to organizations providing free food access for people reliant on SNAP and EBT. In response to the government shutdown and reduced SNAP funding, the tribe is expanding its efforts to support local food banks and providers, including partnering with Snoqualmie Casino & Resort to donate surplus food. Other initiatives include a gas discount at Crescent Market, turkey donations, and grants for licensed childcare facilities to support youth food access.
