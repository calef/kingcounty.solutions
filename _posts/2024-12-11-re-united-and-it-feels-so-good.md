  <p>On an average day, Bike Works receives seventeen bicycles from individual donations and through partnerships with the City of Seattle and King County. Bikes from the city are almost always from walk-in dumpsters specifically for donating bikes. The origins of bikes from King County Surplus are not always apparent.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Seth, from Bike Works’ Recycle &amp; Reuse (R&amp;R) department, says it&#8217;s clear which bikes were meant for donation—they have dry rotted tires, some rust, or a thick dose of garage dust. But some of the bikes we get look like they were loved, and recently. Inflated tires, drivetrain in good order, and utilitarian features like baskets and racks are a good indication that the bicycle in question is an important part of somebody&#8217;s life. Rebekah from R&amp;R agrees that these and other details make a potentially stolen bike stand out. &#8220;Nicer bikes that have a bad paint job ring the alarms, so we set those aside.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



  <p></p>



  <p>Whenever a bike does stand out, staff look for the bike&#8217;s serial number on<a href="https://bikeindex.org/"> Bike Index</a>, a non-profit database of bikes used globally. All told, R&amp;R folks spend an hour or two cross referencing each week. And once or twice a month, they reconnect a bike with its owner. Bike Index users submit photos, serial numbers, and if their bike is stolen, details about the theft.</p>



  <p>After a recent pickup from King County Surplus, Seth noticed a green 1990s Kona with fenders, a front basket, and non-stock parts—it stood out to him. Someone had spent a lot of time and energy building up this bike. He put the bike aside and looked it up on Bike Index.&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The bike was reported stolen from the Central District in August while it was u-locked outside a friend’s place. Seth contacted the owner of the bike through Bike Index and after a while was able to reach them on the phone. While nobody knows exactly how the bike ended up at King County Surplus, it would be fair to conclude that it was left on a bus or somewhere on King County property before it ended up there.</p>

  <p>The bike’s owner, Alan. He says he recognized Seth’s voice almost immediately, and though he had already replaced the bike, he was really glad to get it back. “It meant a lot to me that Seth saw the bike and recognized how much care and thought I’d put into it. I felt seen.” So in the span of about four hours, Alan was reunited with a bike he’d lost to theft six months ago.</p>

On average, Bike Works receives seventeen bicycles daily through donations and partnerships with the City of Seattle and King County. Bikes often come from dumpsters or the King County Surplus, with varying conditions indicating their history. Staff members from the Recycle & Reuse department, like Seth and Rebekah, identify potentially stolen bikes by their condition and features. They use the Bike Index, a global database, to check serial numbers and reunite bikes with their owners. 

Recently, Seth found a distinctive green 1990s Kona bike that had been reported stolen six months earlier. After contacting the owner, Alan, he learned that although Alan had replaced the bike, he was grateful to have it back, feeling recognized for the care he put into it. Alan had acquired the bike from a friend at The Bikery, and despite its muddy condition upon receipt, it cleaned up well. Rebekah emphasizes the importance of securely locking bikes and registering them to facilitate recovery in case of theft, as digital records can help with insurance and reconnecting owners with their bikes.
