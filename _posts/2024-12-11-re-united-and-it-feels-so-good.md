On average, Bike Works receives seventeen bicycles daily through donations and partnerships with the City of Seattle and King County. Bikes often come from dumpsters or the King County Surplus, with varying conditions indicating their history. Staff members from the Recycle & Reuse department, like Seth and Rebekah, identify potentially stolen bikes by their condition and features. They use the Bike Index, a global database, to check serial numbers and reunite bikes with their owners. 

Recently, Seth found a distinctive green 1990s Kona bike that had been reported stolen six months earlier. After contacting the owner, Alan, he learned that although Alan had replaced the bike, he was grateful to have it back, feeling recognized for the care he put into it. Alan had acquired the bike from a friend at The Bikery, and despite its muddy condition upon receipt, it cleaned up well. Rebekah emphasizes the importance of securely locking bikes and registering them to facilitate recovery in case of theft, as digital records can help with insurance and reconnecting owners with their bikes.
