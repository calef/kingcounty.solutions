This past August, Bellevue LifeSpring’s Fairweather Circle organized a summer fundraiser titled Blooms, Bubbles, and Bling, held in Denise Lane’s award-winning garden. Attendees browsed a selection of new and gently used jewelry while enjoying refreshments, all to support the fight against hunger and homelessness for children in Bellevue. Guests were welcomed by vibrant yellow roses and friendly Fairweather Circle members, who aimed to creatively sell items collected from the former Bellevue LifeSpring thrift store alongside new donations from the community. Denise Lane, a well-known local host, opened her garden to share its beauty and foster community enjoyment. The event emphasized the power of collaboration and creativity in making a difference, with every jewelry sale and drink contributing to Bellevue LifeSpring’s essential programs for local children. For over a century, Fairweather Circle members have exemplified the spirit of neighbors helping neighbors, innovating fundraising efforts and advocating for the youth of Bellevue. The Fairweather Circle is one of five membership circles within the Bellevue community, continuing to create impactful events.
