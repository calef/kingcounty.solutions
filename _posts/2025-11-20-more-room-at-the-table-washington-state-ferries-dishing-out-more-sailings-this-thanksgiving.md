Washington State Ferries (WSF) is increasing service for Thanksgiving 2025, offering over 420 daily sailings, a 10% increase compared to recent years. Approximately 300,000 riders are expected from November 26 to November 30. Although service has improved, travelers using vehicles should be prepared for potential long waits at terminals. WSF Deputy Secretary Steve Nevey expressed gratitude for the enhanced reliability and service, crediting the efforts of employees and support from state leadership.

Travelers are advised to plan ahead using the WSDOT mobile app or WSF website to check sailing schedules and terminal conditions. The busiest travel times are anticipated to be westbound on November 26 and 27, and eastbound on November 29 and 30, with heavy traffic expected on November 28 as well. To minimize wait times, early morning or late-night sailings are recommended, as well as considering transit options to walk or bike onto the ferry.

On Thanksgiving Day, certain routes will have holiday schedule adjustments. Travelers are encouraged to check for updates and be aware of potential traffic delays when heading to ferry terminals. WSF remains the largest ferry system in the U.S., providing crucial transport services across scenic waterways.
