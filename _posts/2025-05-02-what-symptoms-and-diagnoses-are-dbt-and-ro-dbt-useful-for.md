DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy) and RO-DBT (Radically Open Dialectical Behavior Therapy) are evidence-based therapies targeting different emotional and behavioral challenges. DBT, developed by Dr. Marsha Linehan, is suited for individuals with emotional dysregulation, impulsivity, and interpersonal issues. It is effective for treating Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), suicidal behaviors, emotional dysregulation, eating disorders, substance use disorders, PTSD, and depression linked to emotional instability. Key components include mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotion regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness, particularly benefiting those who experience intense emotions.

Conversely, RO-DBT, created by Dr. Thomas Lynch, is designed for people who exhibit over-control, perfectionism, and emotional inhibition. It is useful for chronic depression, anorexia nervosa, Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD), higher-functioning Autism Spectrum Disorders, maladaptive overcontrol, and social isolation. RO-DBT emphasizes openness, flexibility, and social connectedness, promoting emotional expression and spontaneity, addressing issues that contrast with DBT’s focus on emotional dysregulation. In summary, DBT helps with under-controlled behaviors while RO-DBT addresses over-controlled behaviors.
