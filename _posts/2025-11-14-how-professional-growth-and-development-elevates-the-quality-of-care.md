For child care providers and early learning educators, ongoing education is essential for enhancing the quality of care they provide to children and families. BrightSpark’s Professional Growth and Development Team offers a range of STARS-fulfilling classes to support providers in meeting Washington State's licensing requirements, which mandate earning 10 training hours per month. These classes, available both in-person and virtually, help improve interactions, curriculum implementation, and cultural awareness among providers.

One program utilizing these resources is Lil’ People’s World in Bellevue, which has benefited significantly from BrightSpark's free training since 2024. Staff members report enhanced understanding of diverse family backgrounds, improved classroom environments that reflect cultural diversity, and better staff training methods. The trainings have led to noticeable improvements in teacher-child interactions and overall care quality. Providers who are well-equipped with knowledge not only thrive in their roles but also positively impact the families they serve. Investing in the professional development of providers ultimately uplifts entire communities and contributes to the well-being of future generations.
