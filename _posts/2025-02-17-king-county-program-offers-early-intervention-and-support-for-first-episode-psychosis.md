  Psychosis can feel overwhelming, and the stigma surrounding it often makes seeking help even harder. At Valley Cities Behavioral Health Care,&nbsp;[the New Journeys program](https://valleycities.org/service/new-journeys/)&nbsp;is working to change that narrative.

  The program focuses on early intervention and compassionate support for individuals aged 15 to 40 in King County who are experiencing their first episode of psychosis.

  More than just treatment, New Journeys offers hope, demonstrating that with the right support, people can lead fulfilling lives and achieve their goals, regardless of the challenges they face.

King County's New Journeys program, operated by Valley Cities Behavioral Health Care, provides early intervention and support for individuals aged 15 to 40 experiencing their first episode of psychosis. This community-based initiative emphasizes holistic care and compassionate support, aiming to combat the stigma surrounding psychosis. The program facilitates home visits from a multidisciplinary treatment team, including psychiatrists, therapists, and peer support specialists, who work closely with clients and their families to develop personalized recovery plans. Initial steps focus on stabilizing symptoms, followed by transitioning clients to less intensive services as they gain skills to manage their condition. With an estimated three in 100 people affected by psychosis, and around 100,000 young individuals experiencing their first episode annually, New Journeys offers a vital opportunity for early intervention. Referrals can be made by individuals or their support networks, ensuring that those in need can access the help they deserve. Valley Cities also encourages donations to sustain and expand its services throughout King County, reinforcing its commitment to supporting mental health and recovery.
