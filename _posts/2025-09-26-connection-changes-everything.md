For older adults, isolation can lead to serious issues such as depression, cognitive decline, and increased mortality. However, connection can transform lives. At Eastside Friends of Seniors, 93% of seniors report feeling less lonely due to the support they receive. Simple acts like transportation to medical appointments, friendly phone calls, and visits from volunteers significantly affect their well-being. One member, Don, experienced a life-changing shift after losing his wife and going weeks without interaction. A weekly visit from a volunteer began with a simple grocery ride and evolved into meaningful conversations and games, restoring his sense of connection. Don expresses gratitude, saying, “Now I look forward to Tuesdays. It reminds me I’m not alone.” Stories like his emphasize the importance of community support for older adults, ensuring they feel seen, valued, and connected. The organization encourages donations to help expand its reach and foster a more age-inclusive community where everyone belongs.
