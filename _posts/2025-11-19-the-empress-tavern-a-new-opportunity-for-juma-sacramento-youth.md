Earlier this year, Sacramento's Empress Tavern underwent a transformation under the management of Alchemist Community Development Corporation, aiming to create a neighborhood-centric event space that highlights local food culture and supports equitable access to good food. Partnering with Juma, a nonprofit that empowers youth, the tavern provides opportunities for Juma youth to gain experience in hospitality through entry-level roles. 

Training from the Empress Tavern team prepares the youth for their new positions, with a goal for them to become sought-after candidates for entry-level jobs in the hospitality industry. Site Manager Zach Hunter emphasizes the importance of instilling accountability and personal responsibility in these young individuals. The partnership also incorporates trauma-informed management training developed by Juma, focusing on creating a supportive work environment. 

Donna Franklin, Juma Sacramento Site Manager, expresses excitement about collaborating with Alchemist CDC to help youth build professionalism and explore career pathways in hospitality. This initiative aims not just to provide jobs but to empower young people to envision and achieve their futures in the industry, ultimately fostering a community where all youth can thrive.
