The City of Bellevue is launching the second year of the Cross-Cultural Center Without Walls program, beginning funding applications on September 15. This initiative aims to support organizations in hosting free events that foster intercultural engagement and learning among Bellevue’s diverse communities. The program encourages interactions among individuals from various racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds. A virtual information session is scheduled for September 18, from 6 to 7 p.m., for interested applicants to learn about the application process; preregistration is required. In its inaugural year, the program facilitated 60 events hosted by 19 organizations, reaching over 4,000 participants. Feedback from these events has helped shape this year's program. For inquiries regarding alternate formats or accommodations, the city encourages contacting them at least 48 hours in advance.
