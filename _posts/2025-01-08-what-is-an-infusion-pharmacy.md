An infusion pharmacy is a specialized facility that prepares medications for injection or infusion, including routine antibiotics and complex chemotherapy drugs. Valley's new Infusion Pharmacy, set to open on February 3, 2025, is located within its Cancer Center to enhance patient care. The pharmacy is staffed with clinical pharmacists and pharmacy technicians who ensure patients receive the correct medications and dosages based on their diagnoses. This setup promotes collaboration among healthcare professionals, which is essential for managing complex patient treatments that require vigilant monitoring and frequent adjustments.

The Infusion Pharmacy is designed to prioritize staff safety while preparing hazardous medications and aims to improve the efficiency of patient care. It plays a crucial role in the healthcare team, providing clinical oversight to ensure that patients receive safe and effective infusion therapies. The state-of-the-art facility will enable timely preparation of all drugs needed for infusions, ultimately enhancing patient throughput and care quality within the Cancer Center.
