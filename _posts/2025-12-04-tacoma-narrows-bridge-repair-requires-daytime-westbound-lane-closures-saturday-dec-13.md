Travelers using State Route 16 Tacoma Narrows Bridge on Saturday, Dec. 13, should prepare for significant delays due to daytime lane closures. From 8 a.m. to 7 p.m., the two left westbound lanes will be closed for maintenance crews to repair a pothole in the bridge deck. This follows a temporary fill of the pothole discovered on Nov. 19, with repairs necessary for a long-term fix. The closure may be rescheduled in case of adverse weather, such as high winds or heavy rain. The Tacoma Narrows Bridge, which is 75 years old, requires ongoing maintenance to ensure safety and functionality. Travelers are advised to allow extra travel time, combine or postpone nonessential trips, and remain cautious and attentive in the work zone. Updates on road work can be received via email, and real-time information is available through the WSDOT app and Travel Center Map.
