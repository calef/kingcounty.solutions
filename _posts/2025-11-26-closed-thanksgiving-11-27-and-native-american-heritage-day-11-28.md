The University of Washington's Wellbeing program announces that it will be closed on Thanksgiving Day, November 27, and on Native American Heritage Day, November 28. Staff and community members are encouraged to take this time to reflect on the significance of these days. Thanksgiving Day is traditionally a time for gratitude and family gatherings, while Native American Heritage Day serves as a reminder of the rich cultures and contributions of Native American peoples. The closure aims to honor both the holiday and the importance of acknowledging the history and experiences of Indigenous communities. Normal operations will resume on November 29.
