The Washington State Department of Transportation will close US 97 near Blewett Pass on December 4 for a day to clear trees and debris from the Labor Mountain Fire burn scar area. The closure will take place between the junction of SR 970 at Lauderdale (milepost 149) and Ingalls Creek Road (milepost 177). This section of road was previously closed for 16 days from September 21 to October 7 due to the fire, marking the longest closure in Blewett Pass history. Crews from the United States Forest Service and WSDOT have pinpointed multiple hazardous tree removal sites north of the summit. The full closure will enable workers to operate at several locations simultaneously without traffic interruptions. Work is set to occur from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on December 4, though schedules may vary due to weather conditions. Travelers are advised to check real-time travel maps for updates. Alternative routes during the closure include US 2 Stevens Pass and State Route 28 through Wenatchee and Quincy.
