Clift Seferlis, a 55-year-old man from Garrett Park, Maryland, pleaded guilty to 17 counts of mailing threatening communications and eight counts of obstructing the free exercise of religion, targeting Jewish organizations. His threats, sent between March 2024 and June 2025, included at least 40 letters and two postcards to over 25 Jewish entities, such as synagogues and community centers, across multiple jurisdictions. The communications often contained threats to harm individuals or damage property. Notably, some threats involved the potential use of weapons, fire, or explosives. Seferlis was charged after an investigation led by the FBI and other agencies, following his arrest in June 2025. He faces a maximum sentence of 169 years in prison, three years of supervised release, and a fine of $5,650,000, with sentencing scheduled for March 16. The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division emphasized its commitment to prosecuting antisemitic threats and upholding federal civil rights laws.
