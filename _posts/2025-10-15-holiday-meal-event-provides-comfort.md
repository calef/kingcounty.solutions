  **Holiday Meal Event Provides Comfort for Army Veteran’s Family After Tragedy**

  Nothing could have prepared Army veteran Brian Jones and his wife, Jessica, for the news they received on March 4.

  Their 19-year-old son, also named Brian, was shot and killed while playing basketball at a public court in Tampa, Florida.

  His senseless death continues to garner headlines as the family begins the long process to find justice through the criminal court system.

  “We are just getting by day by day,” Jessica said. “It’s a roller coaster and that’s the only way I can describe it. Everything is still so fresh.”

  They are doing their best to make sure the family is there for their son’s daughter, their granddaughter, who is 6 months old.

  The Joneses 20-year marriage has always required them to lean on each other and work together —during Brian’s two deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, his medical retirement in 2014, parenting seven kids, and Jessica’s recent epilepsy diagnosis.

Army veteran Brian Jones and his wife, Jessica, faced immense grief after the tragic loss of their 19-year-old son, Brian, who was shot while playing basketball in Tampa, Florida. As they navigate this painful time, they strive to support their 6-month-old granddaughter and each other through their 20-year marriage, which has already weathered challenges like Brian's military deployments and Jessica's recent epilepsy diagnosis. Seeking comfort, the family attended an Operation Homefront Holiday Meals for Military® event in Tampa, marking their first public outing since the tragedy. Jessica found the event to be a significant source of stress relief, especially as the family was not in the right emotional or financial state to celebrate the holiday on their own. Their younger children engaged in activities that provided soothing distraction, and Jessica appreciated the comprehensive food gift basket that made preparing a family meal easier. Both Brian and Jessica expressed gratitude for Operation Homefront and its support for veterans and their families during tough times. Since its inception, Operation Homefront's program has delivered more than 210,000 holiday meals to military and veteran families.
