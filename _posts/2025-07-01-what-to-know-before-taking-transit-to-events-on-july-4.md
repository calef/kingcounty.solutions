On July 4, King County Metro buses will operate on a Sunday schedule, with planned reroutes due to various events including parades and festivals in locations such as Bellevue, Bothell, and Seattle. Passengers should check service advisories for their specific routes. The Seattle Streetcar will maintain regular service on the First Hill Line and offer extended hours on the South Lake Union Line. Note that streetcars will pause during the Lake Union fireworks from 10:15 p.m. to 10:45 p.m., but extra service will resume afterward, with the last trip to downtown Seattle departing at approximately 11:15 p.m. Sound Transit will implement an extended Sunday schedule, with the last train to Angle Lake leaving at 1:48 a.m. on July 5. The 2 Line will run trains every 10 minutes, concluding service around 11:32 p.m. There will be no Sounder service. The King County Water Taxi will follow its regular weekday schedule for both the West Seattle and Vashon routes. For travel planning, users can access Metro's Trip Planner online or text their stop ID to 62550 for bus departure times.
