On October 11, the Day of the Girl emphasizes the power of education in unlocking leadership potential among girls. CAMFED is dedicated to supporting girls and young women, ensuring they not only stay in school but thrive academically and socially. Students like Francisca and Fatou from Ghana share their aspirations of becoming lawyers, highlighting the importance of education in shaping their futures and advocating for marginalized voices. Both actively participate in their school's debate team, enhancing their confidence and leadership skills. After graduation, they will join the CAMFED Association, a network of more than 313,000 young women who have received CAMFED support, with many taking on leadership roles in their communities. 

Recently, CAMFED members in Tanzania provided secondary school students with hygiene products and safety information. CAMFED Malawi received recognition as the best NGO for girls' education in the country, while stories from Zambia and Zimbabwe showcase the transformative impact of CAMFED's support on students' educational journeys and future ambitions. The organization encourages collective action to promote equitable access to education and decision-making opportunities for girls across Africa.
