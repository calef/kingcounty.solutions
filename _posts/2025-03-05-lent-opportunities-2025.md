  <p>“This year for Lent, I have decided to take on a project that will hopefully bless our church congregation and will enrich my life as well, as I &nbsp;give my time and passion to creating each piece of music. For each of the forty days of Lent, I will create an improvisation on a hymn and will upload it to an ongoing playlist on Soundcloud. Church members can listen and share the music for free through the Soundcloud app or website! My goal is to give us each something sacred, beautiful, and calm to contemplate throughout Lent. Each day’s musical offering would make a great pairing with our Lenten Devotional! I would also encourage you to look up the lyrics for the hymns to meditate on as you listen to the music. Most of these hymn selections are requests from your fellow congregants, and knowing the lyrics will give us a way to connect with the longings of each other‘s hearts and minds. I have uploaded the first 9 tracks already, since I am out of town for the next week, and after that you can check back each day for the newest uploads through Lent!” <em>Elisabeth Ellis, Music Director</em></p>

  <p>Kids will have an opportunity to participate in the practice of almsgiving with the United Methodist&#8217;s Church&#8217;s&nbsp;&#8220;Coins for Lent&#8221; activity. During Lent, we are reminded to examine our lifestyles and ask, &#8220;What can we do for others?&#8221; Part of faith formation at any age is compassion and serving our neighbors. Lent is a good time to commit to giving money to a project that helps people in need. Use the attached calendar to collect coins in a jar for each day of Lent. We&#8217;ll then collect everyone&#8217;s coins together and donate it to an organization after Easter, decided on by the participants. Let me know if you are participating in the activity so that we can coordinate! &#8211; Rev. Jackie</p>

For Lent 2025, Elisabeth Ellis, the Music Director, will create a daily improvisation on a hymn, sharing it on a Soundcloud playlist for church members to listen to and reflect upon. The initiative aims to provide a calming and sacred musical experience throughout Lent, encouraging members to meditate on hymn lyrics. Pastor Wongee will lead discussions on James Cone's book, *The Cross and the Lynching Tree*, on March 16, 23, 30, and April 6, with lunch provided. Participation in person or virtually is available, and prior reading of the book is encouraged. Kids can engage in the "Coins for Lent" activity, collecting coins for donation to a chosen organization after Easter, fostering a spirit of almsgiving. The Global Missions Team will collaborate with Neighborhood House to assemble Welcome Kits for families in need during Lent. Items for these kits will be collected throughout the season. Additionally, on Ash Wednesday, March 5th, Pastor Wongee and Pastor Jackie will offer the imposition of ashes at the International Fountain. An International Women’s Day event will also take place at the Museum of Pop Culture from 1-4:30 PM.
