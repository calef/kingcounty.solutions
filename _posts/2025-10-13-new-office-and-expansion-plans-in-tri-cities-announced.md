LCSNW is expanding and relocating its Tri-Cities district to a new 38,000-square-foot facility in the former Amazon building at 7011 W Canal Drive in Kennewick, with plans for completion in late August 2026. This move consolidates operations from two older locations, enhancing support for youth and families in Benton and Franklin Counties. LCSNW has provided services for 61 years and has outgrown its current spaces, which include two buildings in Kennewick and one in Pasco. The new facility will feature 25 offices, 8 conference rooms, and 3 staff break rooms, significantly increasing usable space. District Director Sharon Gentry emphasized the importance of this transition as an investment in the future of youth mental health. The new location aims to provide a trauma-informed environment and accommodate on-site staff and family events. Renovations are set to begin in November 2025, and LCSNW is actively seeking community support and grant funding to meet the urgent mental health needs of the youth.
