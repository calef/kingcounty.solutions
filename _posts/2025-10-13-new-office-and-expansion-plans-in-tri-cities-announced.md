  # New office and expansion plans in Tri-Cities announced

  **LCSNW is thrilled to announce a major step forward in our mission to support youth and families in the region: we’re expanding and relocating!**

  Tentatively scheduled for late August 2026, the [LCSNW Tri-Cities district](https://lcsnw.org/office/tri-cities/) will consolidate operations from two long-serving facilities into a modern, 38,000-square-foot space designed to better support staff and community needs. The new LCSNW office will be located in the former Amazon building at 7011 W Canal Drive in Kennewick.

  LCSNW has provided mental and behavioral health services to youth across Benton and Franklin Counties for 61 years, and more than half of that time has been operated out of the non-profit’s current offices on Kennewick Avenue and Morain Street in Kennewick. Programs expanded into a new office in Pasco in 2021; however, with a steady stream of referrals, LCSNW programs have outgrown their current Kennewick space.

LCSNW is expanding and relocating its Tri-Cities district to a new 38,000-square-foot facility in the former Amazon building at 7011 W Canal Drive in Kennewick, with plans for completion in late August 2026. This move consolidates operations from two older locations, enhancing support for youth and families in Benton and Franklin Counties. LCSNW has provided services for 61 years and has outgrown its current spaces, which include two buildings in Kennewick and one in Pasco. The new facility will feature 25 offices, 8 conference rooms, and 3 staff break rooms, significantly increasing usable space. District Director Sharon Gentry emphasized the importance of this transition as an investment in the future of youth mental health. The new location aims to provide a trauma-informed environment and accommodate on-site staff and family events. Renovations are set to begin in November 2025, and LCSNW is actively seeking community support and grant funding to meet the urgent mental health needs of the youth.
