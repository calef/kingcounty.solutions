The St. Luke’s Apartments, an affordable housing project adjacent to the church, has officially opened with 84 units in an 8-story building. Initially aiming for 42 apartments, the project exceeded expectations and now provides two- and three-bedroom units for families, some with up to five children. The building features a rooftop community space, children's play area, solar panels, and gardens, allowing residents to enjoy views of downtown Seattle and Mt. Rainier. One notable success includes a family who previously lived in their car, now settled in a furnished three-bedroom apartment and enrolled in local schools. The redevelopment plans include a Phase 2 that will add 206 more housing units and a new church space, with construction expected to start in 2026 or early 2027. Discussions are underway with a childcare provider, Launch, for future partnership. The community has rallied support, achieving $2 million of the $2.5 million goal for the capital campaign.
