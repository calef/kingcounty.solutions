  Graffiti can be frustrating to see in our neighborhoods, especially when it appears along major roadways or at transit stations. The City of Bellevue shares your concerns and is committed to keeping our public spaces safe, clean and welcoming.

  While the city promptly addresses graffiti on property we own or manage, many frequently tagged areas – like freeway walls, overpasses and light rail stations – are owned and maintained by other public agencies. In those cases, the best way to ensure the graffiti is addressed is to report it directly to the property owner.&nbsp;

  When graffiti is on:

  Freeway overpasses, embankments or freeway and overpass signs, report it to the state [Department of Transportation](https://wsdot.wa.gov/about/contacts/report-graffiti).

  Light rail stations and transit facilities, call or text Sound Transit Security [206-398-5268](tel:+2063985268) or use the Feedback form at [SoundTransit.org](https://www.soundtransit.org/help-contacts).&nbsp;

  The City of Bellevue does not remove graffiti from WSDOT or Sound Transit property, but the city shares information and coordinates with our partners. By reporting graffiti directly to the responsible agency, you help keep our region clean and support efficient maintenance.

  ## A new approach to prevention

  To help reduce tagging, Sound Transit is piloting a new approach by working with graffiti artists to create original artwork at some of its stations. The goal is to transform frequently vandalized spaces into community-oriented art that discourages further graffiti.
