  Summary: Following a [letter of conditional support](https://harrell.seattle.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/23/2025/08/COS-CCC-Letter.pdf) from Mayor Bruce Harrell outlining a launch plan, Executive Shannon Braddock submitted a proposal to the King County Council to open the second Crisis Care Center in the&nbsp;region.

  **Story**

  Today, King County Executive Shannon Braddock and Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell announced next steps for a Crisis Care Center in Seattle providing behavioral health care for people experiencing a mental health, drug, or alcohol crisis. The facility would be located at the former Polyclinic building at 1145 Broadway.

  King County voters approved the Crisis Care Centers Initiative in 2023 to create five centers across the region **where anyone can walk in for behavioral health and substance use&nbsp;care**.

  In recent years, King County has seen a significant increase in demand for crisis services, driven by rising rates of behavioral health conditions and substance use disorders, and the ongoing fentanyl crisis. These centers will provide immediate help, connections to ongoing care, and a safe, stable place to recover that’s available to everyone — regardless of insurance status or ability to&nbsp;pay.

  The facility in Seattle’s First Hill neighborhood would serve the central region as part of a new, countywide network of five crisis centers. The county established its first center last year with Connections Kirkland, [serving North King County communities](https://dchsblog.com/2025/02/12/king-county-announces-connections-health-solutions-as-operator-of-the-first-crisis-care-center-in-kirkland/).

  “Collaboration across our region made this major step toward expanding crisis services possible,” said **Executive Braddock**. “From the start, King County has worked hand-in-hand with communities across the region, including Seattle, to increase access to behavioral health treatment and services. The City of Seattle’s partnership is a strong example of how local governments can come together to make care accessible. By engaging residents, first responders, local organizations, and businesses, we’ve heard loud and clear the urgent need for immediate care. We know treatment works — we just need more of&nbsp;it.”

  “This Crisis Care Center will serve as a remedy for suffering and disorder we too frequently see on our streets — it means more effective treatment to help people recover,” said **Mayor Harrell**. “As we continue our work to support those in need, create community safety, and revitalize the health and vitality of this neighborhood and our entire city, ensuring this location is a success will require the comprehensive approach we have advocated for.

These mitigation strategies include conducting a safety assessment, implementing Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design recommendations to prevent disorder, and creating a plan for maintaining the safety and cleanliness of surrounding exterior spaces. The requirements are similar to efforts taken by the city and county when DESC successfully opened the STAR Center downtown.

  Over the past four months, King County has held more than 40 presentations and community conversations with First Hill and Capitol Hill residents, organizations, businesses, hospitals, and first responders.

  First Responders and medical professionals have shared that this location will [relieve the current strain](https://dchsblog.com/2025/04/29/first-responders-in-king-county-applaud-crisis-care-centers/) on emergency rooms and help them do their&nbsp;jobs.

  “As a physician and interim president of Virginia Mason Medical Center, I see the lasting impacts of patients coming to us in crisis,” said **David Tupponce, M.D., Interim President of Virginia Mason Medical Center**. “We remain committed to providing the highest quality of care to all we serve and we also know there are limits to what we can provide here in the hospital and in our emergency department. The Crisis Care Center will fill a critical gap in our community and ensure support is available to those who need it&nbsp;most.”

  According to county officials, the site is well-positioned for success because it includes:

  - **Existing Infrastructure** : The building was previously owned by Polyclinic/Optum and has the medical infrastructure needed to speed up&nbsp;opening.

  - **Zoning & Square Footage** : It also has the right square footage and is zoned for a health care facility with the ability to connect to other medical services.

  - **Central Location** : It is in a central location near major transportation corridors and three hospital emergency departments, making referrals and first responder drop-off convenient.

King County and the City of Seattle are advancing plans for a second Crisis Care Center to address rising behavioral health and substance use crises in the region. Following a supportive letter from Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell, King County Executive Shannon Braddock proposed establishing the center at the former Polyclinic building on Broadway. This initiative aligns with the 2023 voter-approved Crisis Care Centers Initiative, which aims to create five accessible centers for immediate behavioral health care.

The Seattle center will serve as part of a broader network, complementing the existing Connections Kirkland center. The facility is designed to provide immediate support and facilitate ongoing care for individuals facing mental health or substance use crises, regardless of their insurance status. Both officials emphasized the importance of community collaboration, focusing on effective strategies to minimize any negative impacts on surrounding neighborhoods.

The King County Council has 30 days to review the purchase agreement, with the center expected to open by the end of 2027 if approved. Community engagement and support will be vital for the center's success, involving local residents and organizations in the planning and operational processes.
