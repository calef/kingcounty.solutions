King County and the City of Seattle are advancing plans for a second Crisis Care Center to address rising behavioral health and substance use crises in the region. Following a supportive letter from Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell, King County Executive Shannon Braddock proposed establishing the center at the former Polyclinic building on Broadway. This initiative aligns with the 2023 voter-approved Crisis Care Centers Initiative, which aims to create five accessible centers for immediate behavioral health care.

The Seattle center will serve as part of a broader network, complementing the existing Connections Kirkland center. The facility is designed to provide immediate support and facilitate ongoing care for individuals facing mental health or substance use crises, regardless of their insurance status. Both officials emphasized the importance of community collaboration, with a focus on effective strategies to minimize any negative impacts on surrounding neighborhoods.

The King County Council has 30 days to review the purchase agreement, with the center expected to open by the end of 2027 if approved. Community engagement and support will be vital for the center's success, involving local residents and organizations in the planning and operational processes.
