The City Council of Bellevue is inviting residents to apply for a vacancy on the Planning Commission. Applications are due by 5 p.m. on Friday, October 24. The Planning Commission plays a crucial role in advising the council on updates to the Comprehensive Plan and evaluating land use regulations, ordinances, and related policies. Meetings are held on the second and fourth Wednesdays of each month at 6:30 p.m., with additional special meetings as necessary. Commissioners are appointed by the mayor and confirmed by the council, serving four-year volunteer terms. The city encourages applicants from diverse backgrounds and experiences. Interested individuals can apply online, or pick up and drop off paper applications at designated city locations, including the City Clerk’s Office and local libraries. Applications can also be submitted via email or mail. For further details regarding the commission's responsibilities, inquiries can be directed to senior planner Kate Nesse.
