title: Seeing 'What Is' Through a Gratitude Lens
topics:

As November brings shorter days and cooler air, it encourages reflection on what truly matters. People often focus on what is lacking—friends not seen, energy not felt, or unmet expectations—leading to a negative mindset. In contrast, gratitude acts as a positive lens, helping individuals recognize the abundance in their lives. By appreciating small joys, such as the warmth of a blanket or a neighbor's greeting, life feels fuller and more connected. Gratitude is a skill that requires practice, akin to strengthening a muscle. A suggested practice for November is to write down or share three things of gratitude each day, regardless of their size, followed by a moment of reflection. This habit can transform perspectives, making it easier to see abundance instead of lack, connection over distance, and joy rather than worry. As Thanksgiving approaches, adopting this gratitude practice can enhance appreciation for all that is present, turning what one has into enough and more.
