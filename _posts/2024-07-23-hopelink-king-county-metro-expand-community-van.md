  County Metro’s [Community Van](https://www.hopelink.org/programs/mobility-management/community-van/)
  service partners with Hopelink as an initiative aimed at improving transportation
  options for communities in King County. Imagine having a convenient way to get around
  your neighborhood or to nearby destinations without relying solely on traditional
  public transit or your own vehicle. That’s where Community Van comes in.&nbsp;\n\nAt
  its core, Community Van is a ridesharing program designed to fill transportation
  gaps in areas where traditional transit might not reach or where there’s limited
  service. Rural areas with low ridership are one example of this.&nbsp;\n\nThe program
  began operations in Shoreline and Lake Forest Park in 2019, and since then, expanded
  into the Redmond area in spring of 2024. Melissa Allan, a Transportation Planner
  for King County Mobility said, “The program is currently working on expanding service
  from the Duvall and Carnation areas to include the entire Snoqualmie Valley area
  in partnership with Hopelink.” Community Van also operates in [many other areas
  of King County](https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/metro/travel-options/community-van).
  &nbsp;\n\n“King County Metro explores shared community trips for non-commute purposes,
  promoting accessibility and cost-effective transit beyond urban centers,” said Teresa
  Ngo, Program Manager for Community Van at Hopelink.&nbsp;\n\n![Community Van riders

  organizations like Hopelink underscores its commitment to serving underrepresented
  communities. By analyzing demographic data, King County Metro has identified equity
  priority areas, ensuring transit access for those who need it most.&nbsp;\n\n“The
  first time we used the van, two people who used walkers came along,” shared Bobbie,
  a rider with Community Van. “Luckily the van had a ramp so that was pretty good.
  I like how this service allows people from different backgrounds to use the van
  even if they might have a mobility challenge.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nPartnerships with
  local organizations play a pivotal role in promoting Community Van use for riders
  like Bobbie. Despite jurisdictional differences, technological upgrades – including
  tablets for trip logs and data analytics – promise to streamline operations and
  enhance outreach efforts.&nbsp;\n\n<script defer>\n\t\t(() => {\n\t\t\tlet article

  Routes:** Unlike fixed-route buses, Community Van routes are flexible and can be
  tailored to the needs of the group.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n<script defer>\n\t\t(() => {\n\t\t\tlet

  The individual costs of a Community Van ride are $2.75 for adults, $1.00 for seniors,
  and free for anyone 18 and under. This also includes reduced and subsidized ORCA
  fares. Additionally, expenses like gas and tolls are covered.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n<script

  Friendly:** By encouraging carpooling and reducing the number of individual vehicles
  on the road, Community Van helps lower carbon emissions.&nbsp;\n\n<script defer>\n\t\t(()

  to Use:** Booking a ride with Community Van is simple and convenient. Riders can
  call, text, email or submit an online form through this website to schedule trips
  and coordinate with other passengers.&nbsp;\n\n<script defer>\n\t\t(() => {\n\t\t\tlet
  article = document.querySelector('.block8391164054109748');\n\n\t\t\tarticle.querySelectorAll('a').forEach(elm

  Community Vans are equipped with features such as wheelchair lifts to accommodate
  passengers with mobility challenges and with a 12-passenger van available, the service
  can accommodate a variety of group sizes.\n\n![Community Van Melissa](https://www.hopelink.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Community_Van_Melissa-682x1024.jpg

  areas like Snoqualmie Valley, King County Metro is embracing new technology in vehicles
  to meet growing demands. “Along with the tablet upgrades to the vans, integration
  efforts with the [ORCA team](https://www.myorca.com/en/) aim to enhance payment
  options, ensuring a seamless experience for riders,” said Melissa, a King County
  Metro representative.&nbsp;\n\nOne of the other unique aspects of Community Van
  is that it’s driven by volunteer community members themselves. These could be neighbors,
  coworkers, or friends who want to share rides to common destinations, like grocery
  store runs, shuttles to community events, and even trips to popular nature destinations.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n_Melissa

  Falls. It was beautiful and Ron, our volunteer driver, was excellent,” Bobbie joyfully
  shared. “It was a great day up there and everybody had fun.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nSince
  then, Bobbie has continued advocating for more of her friends and neighbors to use
  the service. “I’ve been trying to book more trips, and different kinds like to grocery
  stores and other stuff we really like,” she shared.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nThe program’s
  two-rider minimum requirement and cost-effective options make it a lifeline for
  seniors and those with mobility challenges who can travel together to get to common
  destinations. Wheelchair accessibility and safety protocols seek to further enhance
  the program’s inclusivity and reliability.&nbsp;\n\n![Volunteers and riders are

  Diana B., dependability means partnering with riders throughout the process. “I
  always communicate with folks to let them know I’m their driver and what time I’ll
  be there,” said Diana. “I’m always on time so riders don’t get worried because a
  lot of times it’s a time sensitive trip.”&nbsp;\n\nAnd riders aren’t the only ones
  benefiting from Community Van. “Last year I volunteered to drive the van for Duvall
  Days,” said Diana. “I probably had 100 people come through the van, and I loved
  the diversity of people and the variety of interesting conversations. What I love
  about Community Van is that I get to interact with different people and learn about
  them.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n<script defer>\n\t\t(() => {\n\t\t\tlet article = document.querySelector('.block1060808136126114');\n\n\t\t\tarticle.querySelectorAll('a').forEach(elm
