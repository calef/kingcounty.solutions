  with celebration, connection with loved ones, traditions, and planning for the year
  ahead, they can also be met with chaos, stress, triggers, and sometimes even unexpected
  crises. As a licensed therapist that specializes in bipolar disorder, burnout, and
  mental health caregiving, I want to share some strategies to help get you through
  this time of year with whatever you may be dealing with. Feel free to scroll down
  to whichever topic is relevant for you.<br /><br /></p>\r\n<h2><strong>Tips for
  Managing </strong><em><span class=\"sqsrte-text-highlight\" data-text-attribute-id=\"6e772f55-758c-4c05-898d-1fb897dd661f\"><a
  href=\"https://www.rootsofcompassiontherapy.com/therapy-for-bipolar-disorder-in-seattle\"><strong>Bipolar
  Disorder</strong></a></span></em><strong> During Fall/Winter</strong></h2>\r\n<p
  class=\"\">Dark and colder months can bring lower moods, energy, isolation, and
  depression. You’re staying inside more, it’s hard to get motivated to stay active,
  and if you’ve struggled with suicidal ideation, that can be exacerbated this time
  of year, especially if you feel triggered by family gatherings. Here, I break down
  some key elements to pay attention to if you’re navigating fluctuating mood and
  symptoms this time of year.</p>\r\n<p class=\"sqsrte-large\"><strong>Stick with
  your routine, but make adjustments</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"\">While it’s easy
  to want to be cozy in your bed and sleep for longer, it’s crucial to stick with
  your routines. Think about your routine shifting from each season and try to keep
  things consistent. If you previously went out for walks or hikes in the summer and
  fall, find ways to get exercise indoors, join a gym, or bundle up with raingear
  to get outside for fresh air and movement. If you’re traveling to visit family this
  time of year, plan for taking medications, eating meals, and going to sleep around
  a similar time each day to limit potential disruption. If you were previously more
  social during summer or have noticed less social activity, try to make contact with
  at least one person each day and add this into your daily routine for accountability.
  These adjustments will go a long way for your overall mood this time of year.</p>\r\n<p
  class=\"sqsrte-large\"><strong>Suicidal ideation and seeing family</strong></p>\r\n<p
  class=\"\">Depending on where you fall on the spectrum of suicidal ideation (SI)
  and where you are at baseline, there’s no question this can increase in colder/winter
  months, or if you’re anticipating seeing family/extended family who may be a source
  of stress for you. I strongly recommend having a safety plan in place with a therapist
  you are working with and plan ahead for triggers that increase SI and identify what
  you can do to cope before, during, and after family gatherings, so you have a safe
  outlet.</p>\r\n<p class=\"sqsrte-large\"><strong>Be mindful of the time change and
  the impact on you</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"\">Going from 9pm sunsets to 4pm sunsets,
  sans sun most of the time, especially if you’re living in the PNW, it can feel like
  an abrupt and unwelcomed shift. You may typically be someone that thrives getting
  things done later in the day, and the extra daylight was helping you stay productive.
  Now, it may feel like the day is wasted and the afternoon darkness can be challenging
  to stay on top of your to-do list. Note the impact this has specifically on you
  so you can pay more attention to taking advantage of the daylight more intentionally.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Addressing
  Your Needs as a </strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span class=\"sqsrte-text-highlight\"
  data-text-attribute-id=\"33bf9e4e-9ae8-4dae-b62e-6f5fae879611\"><a href=\"https://www.rootsofcompassiontherapy.com/therapy-for-stress-and-burnout-seattle\"><strong>Burned
  Out Professional</strong></a></span></span></em></h2>\r\n<p class=\"\">This is an
  important time of year for you, as you may be thinking about what changes you want
  to make to create more happiness in your workplace, how much longer you want to
  stay at your job, or perhaps you’re planning your swift exit for the new year. While
  this can be exciting to think about and envision yourself taking different steps
  for yourself or starting in a new workplace, it doesn’t take away the burnout you’ve
  already experienced and whether or not you’ve had space to fully process things.
  Being around family for the holidays may be met with questions or pressure about
  your plans, and that’s challenging if they are up in the air or you’re not leaving
  anytime soon. This can also create judgment from others or hearing unsolicited advice
  on what to do, which is easier said than done not being in your shoes with the burned-out
  career.</p>\r\n<p class=\"sqsrte-large\"><strong>Set healthy boundaries around what
  you’re comfortable talking about</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"\">Yes, you know this.
  You’ve tried, but loved ones press, even if they have good intent. I suggest you
  decide ahead of time what your comfort level is. Are you wanting to share the news
  that you’re leaving? Are you unsure about a timeline and would prefer to wait until
  that is set before announcing it? Or, are you just not in a place to leave your
  job this second, so you don’t have any new updates to share? Get clear where you’re
  at and then determine if you’re needing to set a boundary. Sometimes it’s helpful
  to have a blanketed general statement you can say, such as, “I appreciate you asking.
  I’m still sorting things out and figuring out what’s best, but don’t have any more
  updates at this time. Do you mind if we hold off from talking more about work?”
  Or even simpler, “I’d prefer if we kept the conversation about non-work-related
  topics, so I can enjoy this gathering.”</p>\r\n<p class=\"sqsrte-large\"><strong>Give
  yourself time to process and heal</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"\">Similar to getting
  time to heal from a breakup and before being ready to start a new relationship,
  a similar approach can be applied when moving to a new job following burnout. It’s
  important you take time to process what just happened, especially so you don’t end
  up repeating the same thing again. When I work with clients leaving dissatisfied
  jobs, we make note of things they were so unhappy with, and make sure these are
  things they can clarify in future interviews with employers to ensure they won’t
  be returning to a similar toxic environment. If you aren’t leaving your job, perhaps
  this is a good opportunity to still process and work on healing from the burnout
  you’ve experienced so things don’t worsen. Either way, I suggest taking time to
  journal and reflect, talk with loved ones that are open to listening, or work with
  a therapist so you can head into your next career without so much baggage from your
  last one or get support with your current situation to make it more manageable.</p>\r\n<p
  class=\"sqsrte-large\"><strong>Treat yourself, however you can</strong></p>\r\n<p
  class=\"\">You’ve worked your ass off this year and whether or not your team, colleagues,
  management, or people you support notice or acknowledge your efforts, you absolutely
  deserve some sort of break. This by no means needs to be a grand international trip,
  but are you taking any additional days off before the end of the year? Do you have
  vacation time you want to use before you give notice? Can you treat yourself to
  a massage, a night off from household or family duties, or get takeout from your
  favorite spot? Think about what you can do and how you might want to treat or nurture
  yourself, so you can enter the new year more rejuvenated and refreshed.<br /><br
  /></p>\r\n<h2><strong>Support for </strong><span class=\"sqsrte-text-highlight\"
  data-text-attribute-id=\"7a8884a9-b3b2-4fe5-9682-a138e9390281\"><a href=\"https://www.rootsofcompassiontherapy.com/family-caregivers-therapy-seattle\"><strong><span
  style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>Family Caregivers</em></span></strong></a></span>
  <strong>Helping Loved Ones with Mental Illness</strong></h2>\r\n<p class=\"\">This
  time of year is also incredibly difficult for you as a family member supporting
  your ____ (enter adult child, partner or spouse, sibling, or parent). They can feel
  triggered and more stressed about managing their routines, taking time off, spending
  expectations, seeing family and relatives in close corners, or even traveling and
  staying with family and being out of the comfort of their own home. This can also
  be a time where hospitalization risk or need for a higher level of care can increase
  due to the number of stressors on their plate. On the flipside, it’s stressful for
  <em>you </em>trying to support them, figure out your own needs, make tough decisions
  on whether or not they join for a family gathering if they are in a good mental
  headspace, and balance needs and demands of other family members. Let’s review some
  pertinent things to consider for supporting yourself, as well as your loved one
  that’s struggling with mental illness.</p>\r\n<p class=\"sqsrte-large\"><strong>For
  you and your family’s well-being</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"\">You’ve been doing
  so much for your loved one and it makes sense your vision of how holiday gatherings
  would ideally go are likely different in reality when you have a family member with
  serious mental illness. There’s grief with that vision that doesn’t get to come
  to fruition. Figure out what you’re wanting and what is in your control. It would
  likely be disruptive to invite your loved one that’s experiencing psychosis to family
  dinner, and that is perfectly okay to not extend the invite. You are not a bad person
  for not including them, as they aren’t in a place to engage in a meaningful way
  at this time. This helps protect and preserve the event and the experience for everyone
  and allows your loved one to not feel uncomfortable when they can’t make clear decisions
  for themselves at this time.</p>\r\n<p class=\"sqsrte-large\"><strong>Understand
  their triggers and warning signs</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"\">Become aware of what
  your loved one is triggered and struggling with, especially this time of year, so
  you can offer support to reduce some of those key triggers. Be able to check in
  for safety risk and get a sense if they are needing a higher level of care for more
  support. Check in with basics: sleep, meds, eating, hygiene, and exercise to ensure
  they are getting these needs met. Are they open to accepting your help or is there
  tension and you’re needing to set boundaries with how much you can support emotionally
  and financially. I’ve worked with families that often feel guilty when they treat
  their loved one with mental illness different from other family members or adult
  children, especially around financial support. I try to remind them their other
  children are in a place to engage, are open to accepting mental health treatment,
  are respectful of boundaries and communication, and are able to be responsible with
  their finances. There is a difference and I want to normalize that.</p>\r\n<p class=\"sqsrte-large\"><strong>Check
  in with you and your loved one’s needs</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"\">What are their
  needs? Are you assuming or have you asked them what they are needing or how they
  are feeling this time of year? This can help build trust, something often missing
  when helping your loved one with mental illness for various reasons. It takes time
  to reestablish trust in the relationship, especially if your loved one perceives
  things as broken. Take a moment to pause and ask the questions. Open-ended, non
  judgmentally, and be genuinely curious.</p>\r\n<p class=\"\">Then get clear on what
  your needs are. Are you needing a break, a conversation with another family member
  that has nothing to do with caring for your loved one, or peace and quiet amidst
  the chaos? Evaluate your own needs and then try to do something for yourself. It’s
  okay to give yourself permission to take a break.</p>\r\n<h2><strong>Increased Confidence
  for Coping During the Holidays</strong></h2>\r\n<p class=\"\">I hope this was informative
  and helpful for addressing how to handle the stressors that come with this time
  of year for those with bipolar disorder, burnout, and family caregivers. Thank you
  for taking the time to read and I wish you the best with navigating holidays and
  family events. Please seek a higher level of care or hospitalization if you’re struggling
  with safety concerns, need space to stabilize, or require more intense treatment
  than once/week therapy. <a href=\"https://connectionshs.com/kirkland\" target=\"_blank\"

During the holidays, many individuals experience increased feelings of loneliness and stress, which can exacerbate mental health issues. Factors such as family dynamics, financial pressures, and social expectations contribute to this crisis. To mitigate these challenges, it's essential to focus on self-care and seek support. Engaging in activities that promote well-being, such as exercise, meditation, or hobbies, can help. Establishing realistic expectations for holiday gatherings and communicating openly with loved ones about feelings can alleviate stress. 

Additionally, reaching out to community resources or support groups can provide assistance. NAMI Eastside emphasizes the importance of recognizing signs of mental distress and encourages individuals to prioritize their mental health. Creating a plan to manage potential triggers and practicing coping strategies can lead to a more fulfilling holiday experience. It's crucial to remember that seeking help is a sign of strength, and individuals should not hesitate to reach out during difficult times. Overall, fostering connections and maintaining a focus on mental well-being can significantly improve one's experience during the holiday season.
