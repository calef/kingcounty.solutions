Black History Month celebrates not only historical figures who fought for civil rights but also contemporary leaders who uplift communities and inspire future generations. Bonita Armstrong and Kendrick Davis exemplify this spirit at Boys & Girls Clubs of King County. Armstrong began her journey in 2010 as a Community Advisory Board member and now serves as Chair of the Board of Directors, advocating for youth access to resources and opportunities. She emphasizes that success varies for each individual, encouraging youth to be their best selves. Davis, an alumnus of the North Seattle Club, returned as an Area Director to ensure that young people, particularly Black youth, see leaders who resonate with their experiences. He inspires them to recognize their value and take up space in various environments. Their leadership highlights the importance of representation and mentorship in the ongoing fight for inclusion and equity. Black History Month serves as a reminder to continue building a supportive framework for all youth, equipping them with the tools and confidence necessary to make significant contributions to society. At Boys & Girls Clubs of King County, this mission is actively pursued every day.
