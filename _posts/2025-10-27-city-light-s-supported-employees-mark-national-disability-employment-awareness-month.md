October marks National Disability Employment Awareness Month, celebrating the contributions of employees with disabilities. This year's theme, "Celebrating Value and Talent," emphasizes the importance of inclusive access to meaningful work. The City of Seattle's Supported Employment Program, initiated in 1998, has created paid job opportunities for individuals with developmental disabilities, with Seattle City Light being an early participant. 

Several supported employees at City Light are highlighted, showcasing their diverse roles and contributions. Alex Hubbard, an office maintenance aide, is also a local rapper and filmmaker advocating for disability rights. Jessica Johnson supports the Emergency Bill Assistance program, emphasizing community connection. TJ Maciel advocates for workplace accessibility and has worked on improving elevator systems. Devin McPoland focuses on administrative tasks, while Todd Newcombe updates customer records. Alicia Partridge has grown in confidence and independence in her role, and Scott Richter, the longest-serving supported employee, values the respect and opportunities he has received.

Currently, around 100 supported employees work across various City departments, with 16 at City Light. Each employee is paired with a vocational coach to tailor jobs to their strengths, promoting accessibility and inclusion in the workplace.
