Juma has made significant strides in its mission to support youth, particularly those facing barriers to employment, through a strategic plan initiated in 2022. Aiming for sustainability and increased outreach, Juma's efforts have led to 67% of its youth participants coming from high-barrier backgrounds by 2024, surpassing the 65% goal. The organization achieved a net promoter score of 45, reflecting high satisfaction among participants. Program completion rates improved dramatically, with 75% of youth finishing the core workshops in 2024, up from 48% in 2022. Additionally, 91% of participants opted for direct deposit, indicating progress in financial literacy and behavior changes. Juma's social enterprise revenue has also grown, increasing from $1.99 million in 2022 to $2.39 million in 2024, which supports paying youth and funding programs. Employment or education connections for program completers rose to 71% in 2024, a significant jump from 27% in 2022. Juma is now developing its next strategic plan to ensure continued growth and improvement, reinforcing its commitment to empowering youth to earn, learn, and thrive in their communities.
