original_content: "**Your Life Matters**\n\nSeptember is Suicide Prevention Month. For young adults ages 15 to 34, suicide is the **second leading cause of death in Washington State**. Suicide remains one of the most stigmatized symptoms of mental illness.\n\nEverything we do at NAMI Eastside helps to prevent the loss of more lives. The power of connection heals, and it’s our goal to remind those struggling that **you are not alone.**\n\nYou do not need to suffer in silence. At NAMI Eastside, our programs act as suicide prevention directly and by teaching the community how to recognize signs and take action. Whether you need mental health support or want to learn more about advocating for others, recovery is possible. Building community is crucial to sustained recovery, and we are your community for mental health support.\n\nIf you or a loved one are in emotional distress or experiencing a suicidal crisis, please remember that your life matters and that you are not alone. **The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline** is available 24/7 for anyone who needs help. You can also text **HOME** to **741741** to connect with a volunteer Crisis Counselor. For LGBTQIA-specific services, **The Trevor Project** is the leading suicide prevention organization for LGBTQIA+ young people. Reach a trained counselor 24/7 at **866-488-7386** or text **678-678**.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Know the Warning Signs of Suicide**\n\nOne of the most powerful ways to prevent suicide is by recognizing the warning signs. By knowing what to look for, we can take action and save lives.\n\n**Warning Signs of Suicide:**\n\n- Feeling hopeless or trapped\n- Withdrawing from friends, family, and activities\n- Giving away personal items\n- Increased use of drugs or alcohol\n- Sleeping too much or too little\n- History of suicide attempts\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor more warning signs, [click here](https://afsp.org/risk-factors-protective-factors-and-warning-signs/).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Suicide Prevention Resources**\n\nTo learn more about suicide prevention and mental health, sign up for a **FREE Mental Health First Aid (MHFA)** course. These courses teach how to recognize mental health crises and provide support.\n\n**Upcoming classes:**\n\n- **Youth MHFA:** September 23 and 24 ([Online](https://reg.learningstream.com/reg/event_page.aspx?ek=0058-0013-d25bfe9d04394af3aee86340b8a8dccd&wp=309). offered by Overlake)\n- **Adult MHFA:** November 9 and 10 (In-person.

Having a sense of purpose through stable, meaningful work can positively impact mental health and overall well-being. NAMI Eastside offers employment support to help connect job seekers with mental health resources, improve stability, and reduce risk factors for suicide.\n\n**Employment can play a role in suicide prevention by:**\n\n- Providing a sense of purpose\n- Offering social connections through workplace relationships\n- Improving financial stability, reducing anxiety\n- Offering access to resources like Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs)\n\nIf you are seeking support in finding meaningful work, you can reach out to NAMI Eastside or come to Together Center where employment specialists and community organizations can help you find a good fit.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Upcoming Events:**\n\n- **NAMI Washington Annual Conference** : September 28-29, Yakima, WA.
