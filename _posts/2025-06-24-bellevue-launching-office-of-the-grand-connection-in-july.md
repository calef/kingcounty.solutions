The city of Bellevue will launch the Office of the Grand Connection on July 16, aimed at enhancing the city's main pedestrian corridor and advancing the design of the Grand Connection Crossing over Interstate 405 to Eastrail. Nathan Torgelson, an experienced leader in urban planning and land use, will direct the office starting June 30, overseeing all aspects of the Grand Connection program. The crossing is pivotal for improving connectivity in the downtown core and has already achieved a 30% design milestone.

The new office will centralize staff from various departments to streamline decision-making and project management. Bellevue has engaged consulting firm HNTB to assist in preparing materials for state committee approval, necessary for advancing the final design. The City Council will review project updates and funding options on July 22. The Grand Connection, a key initiative since 2014, aims to create cohesive and engaging public spaces throughout Bellevue’s central business district, stretching over 1.5 miles from Meydenbauer Bay Park to the Wilburton area. The program emphasizes land use planning, public space activation, and stakeholder communication to foster connections within the community.
