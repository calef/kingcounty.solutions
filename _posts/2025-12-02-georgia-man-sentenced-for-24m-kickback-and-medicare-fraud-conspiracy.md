A Georgia man has been sentenced to 24 months in prison for his role in a kickback and Medicare fraud conspiracy. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Dominic T. Burch, 43, was involved in a scheme that defrauded Medicare by receiving illegal kickbacks for patient referrals to a medical clinic. Burch, along with others, was accused of accepting payments in exchange for steering Medicare beneficiaries to the clinic, which purportedly provided unnecessary medical services. The fraudulent activities led to substantial financial losses for Medicare. In addition to the prison sentence, Burch was ordered to pay restitution of over $1.6 million. This case highlights ongoing efforts to combat healthcare fraud and protect the integrity of federal healthcare programs. The investigation was conducted by the FBI and the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General.
