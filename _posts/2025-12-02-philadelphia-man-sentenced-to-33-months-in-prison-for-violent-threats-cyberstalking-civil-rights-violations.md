A Philadelphia man has been sentenced to 33 months in prison for making violent threats and engaging in cyberstalking, violating civil rights. The defendant, identified as 34-year-old Brian Joseph Pomeroy, targeted a victim online, sending threatening messages that included racial slurs and violent language. Pomeroy’s behavior escalated to the point where he made explicit threats to harm the victim and their family. He was charged with cyberstalking, which involved using online platforms to intimidate and harass the victim. In addition to the prison sentence, Pomeroy was ordered to complete three years of supervised release following his incarceration. This case highlights the federal commitment to combat cyberstalking and protect victims from online harassment. The U.S. Attorney’s Office emphasized the seriousness of such threats and harassment, particularly when they are racially motivated. The prosecution underscored the need to hold offenders accountable for their actions in order to safeguard civil rights and ensure public safety.
