Thirty-two years ago, on September 8, 1993, the first Rotating Shelter opened its doors, marking the beginning of what would become Congregations for the Homeless, now known as PorchLight. Initially, only two men sought refuge that night, but this small start was rooted in the vision of community members and faith leaders aiming to provide safety and dignity to men experiencing homelessness in East King County. Over the years, PorchLight has expanded significantly, currently offering shelter and support to 100 men nightly at the Emergency Men’s Shelter and an additional 25 at the Rotating Shelter. Despite the growth in numbers, the core mission remains the same: to welcome men with compassion, provide essential care, and assist them towards stability. As PorchLight embarks on its 33rd year, it reflects on its origins and invites the community to contribute to its mission. Support options include a one-time gift of $33 or a $33 monthly commitment as a LightKeeper, aimed at ensuring ongoing shelter and care for those in need. Together, PorchLight emphasizes the collective strength in community support, celebrating a legacy that began with just two individuals.
