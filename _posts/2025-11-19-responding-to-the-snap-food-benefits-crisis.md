For about 12 days in November 2025, over half a million families in Washington state faced uncertainty regarding their food security as payments from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) were halted. Fortunately, following the reopening of the federal government on November 12, the Department of Social and Health Services resumed monthly payments. In response to the crisis, Solid Ground mobilized quickly, supporting local food banks through real-time assessments and emergency funding, distributing grocery store gift cards to residents, coordinating shuttle services to grocery stores, and providing nonperishable food supplies.

Despite the resumption of SNAP benefits, many families continue to struggle with rising food prices. Solid Ground encourages community involvement by subscribing to their Resource Wire newsletter for updates on available support, locating food banks through the Seattle Food Committee's online tool, and donating food or essentials. They also urge advocacy for funding of SNAP and similar programs, emphasizing the need for a stronger social safety net as millions may lose access to essential assistance due to recent federal actions. The community's response to this crisis highlights the importance of collective efforts to address food insecurity.
