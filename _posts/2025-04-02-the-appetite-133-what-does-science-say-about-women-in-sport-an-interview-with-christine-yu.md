In a recent episode of The Appetite, Kara Bazzi, Opal’s Director of Exercise+Sport, interviews Yu, who shares insights on the intersection of gender and sport. Their discussion highlights the need for better information and understanding of gender differences in athletics, aiming to support all athletes regardless of their experiences. Yu's work focuses on disseminating essential knowledge and acknowledging the ongoing efforts required to improve the landscape for female athletes.
