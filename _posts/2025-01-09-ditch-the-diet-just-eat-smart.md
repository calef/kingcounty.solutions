The three-session workshop will cover essential topics including preparing balanced meals to manage hunger, applying five nutrition habits to lower the risk of chronic disease, understanding and debunking fad diets, and enjoying favorite foods mindfully. Additionally, participants will learn how to shop for groceries and dine out while maintaining a healthy lifestyle, as well as gain insights into the challenges of aging from a Lifestyle Medicine perspective. The workshop is scheduled for February 20, 27, and March 6, from 6 PM to 7:30 PM, at Valley Medical Center’s Medical Arts Center Auditorium, with a registration fee of $125.
