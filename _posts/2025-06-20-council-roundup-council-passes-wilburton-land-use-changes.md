On June 20, 2025, the Bellevue City Council approved significant land use code changes and rezoned the Wilburton transit-oriented development area to realize the Wilburton Vision. This initiative aims to create a vibrant, mixed-use neighborhood with robust transit connections. The rezone introduces four new mixed-use land use districts, along with code changes that establish design standards to promote housing and job growth, affordable housing, walkability, and open space. Updates to noise and sign regulations were also made to align the new districts with downtown standards. The council adopted the ordinance with modifications, including adjustments to street type dimensions, development fee timelines, and a new incentive for upper-level building stepbacks. The changes were unanimously approved, moving forward with Wilburton's long-term vision.

Additionally, councilmembers participated in required ethics training, covering laws on conflicts of interest, use of public resources, and other ethical considerations. Furthermore, the council proclaimed June 19, 2025, as Juneteenth in Bellevue, with city facilities closed to observe the holiday.
