Justine Ing's journey with the Walk for Rice began at the age of eight in 2014, inspired by her grandmother, a long-time participant and community activist. After her grandmother's passing that same year, Justine took on the role of team captain and has since walked annually, honoring her grandmother's legacy while addressing food insecurity within the community. Justine emphasizes the importance of the ACRS Food Bank for the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community and encourages others to join by sharing personal stories about the walk's significance. 

Her participation became even more meaningful in 2023 when her brother joined her for the first time alongside their grandfather. Justine views the Walk for Rice not only as a tribute to her grandmother's contributions but as an opportunity to help feed those in need. She also enjoys baking as a way to spread joy in her community. Justine's story illustrates how individual actions rooted in love and legacy can strengthen communities and inspire collective efforts against issues like hunger.
