  As winter settles into the Snoqualmie Valley, colder temperatures, icy walkways, and wet weather increase the risk of slips and falls, especially for older adults or individuals managing mobility challenges. The good news: with a few simple strengthening and balance strategies, many winter-related falls can be prevented.

  #### **Why Winter Increases Fall Risk**

  Ice, wet leaves, uneven surfaces, and reduced daylight all contribute to instability outdoors. Inside the home, cluttered walkways or heavy winter footwear can also make balance more difficult. Strength, flexibility, and reaction time all play a role in keeping you steady when conditions become unpredictable.

  #### **Therapist-Recommended Tips for Winter Balance**

  Physical therapists at Snoqualmie Valley Health recommend incorporating these simple habits into your weekly routine:

  - **Practice single-leg balance** near a stable counter or surface

  - **Strengthen ankles and hips** through step-ups, mini-squats, and side-stepping

  - **Wear supportive footwear** with solid tread and good traction

  - **Slow down** and use handrails on outdoor steps or ramps

  - **Improve visibility** by keeping walkways well-lit and free of clutter

  If you’ve recently had a fall, feel unsteady on your feet, or are concerned about your balance, a physical therapy evaluation can help identify specific areas for improvement. Early support can significantly reduce your risk and improve confidence during the winter months.

  #### **Support for Caregivers and Family Members**

  Winter can also be especially challenging for individuals with chronic conditions or limited mobility. Occupational therapists can help develop indoor activity routines, recommend adaptive equipment, and ensure the home environment remains safe and accessible.

  Speech-language pathologists can support individuals who experience memory, communication, or voice challenges—especially during busy holiday gatherings.

Winter can pose significant risks for falls due to icy conditions and snow accumulation. To prevent falls, it's essential to prioritize balance and safety. Wearing appropriate footwear with good traction can help navigate slippery surfaces. Keeping walkways clear of snow and ice is crucial, as is using salt or sand to improve traction. Inside homes, decluttering spaces and using non-slip mats can reduce hazards.

Engaging in exercises that enhance balance and strength, such as yoga or tai chi, can significantly lower fall risk. Regular check-ups with healthcare providers can help address any health concerns that may affect balance. It's also important to be aware of medications that might cause dizziness or affect coordination.

Staying vigilant about environmental conditions and making necessary adjustments can help maintain safety. By taking proactive steps, individuals can enjoy the winter season while minimizing the risk of falls and injuries.
