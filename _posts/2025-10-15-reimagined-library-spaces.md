KCLS is working with a specialized architecture firm to revitalize its library spaces over the next decade. The focus is on accessibility, flexibility and evolving community needs. Five scalable design packages are being created to apply to different locations. Updates include new paint, carpeting, upgraded technology, and enhanced children's and teen areas with a focus on play-based learning. The first redesign was completed at Valley View Library in October 2025, with Auburn Library next in line. Kent, Des Moines, and South Center Libraries are scheduled for projects in 2026. This initiative aims to establish a standard for innovation, inclusion, and community impact.
