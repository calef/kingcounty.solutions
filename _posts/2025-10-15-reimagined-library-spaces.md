  Upgraded spaces are designed to meet the expectations of modern users, with accessibility, flexibility and evolving community needs a primary focus. KCLS engaged an architecture firm that specializes in libraries to assist with the development of five design packages that can be used over the next ten years to reimagine spaces with scalability to apply to varying-sized locations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  We have now entered the planning stage with key updates underway to develop high-impact, cost-effective design solutions for existing library buildings, establishing a standard for innovation, inclusion, and community impact. New paint and carpets are being replaced, walkways are being updated with accessible designs, technology is being upgraded, and renewed children’s and teen areas are being enhanced to encourage more play-based learning.&nbsp;

  The first refresh was completed at Valley View Library in October 2025, with Auburn Library next. Kent, Des Moines, and South Center Libraries have all been selected for projects in 2026.&nbsp;

KCLS is working with a specialized architecture firm to revitalize its library spaces over the next decade. The focus is on accessibility, flexibility, and evolving community needs. Five scalable design packages are being created to apply to different locations. Updates include new paint, carpeting, upgraded technology, and enhanced children's and teen areas with a focus on play-based learning. The first redesign was completed at Valley View Library in October 2025, with Auburn Library next in line. Kent, Des Moines, and South Center libraries are scheduled for projects in 2026. This initiative aims to establish a standard for innovation, inclusion, and community impact.
