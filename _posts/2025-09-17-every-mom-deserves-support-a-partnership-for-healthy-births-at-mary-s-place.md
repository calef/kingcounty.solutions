original_content: "<p class=\"\">Pregnancy and childbirth can be both beautiful and
  challenging—especially for women experiencing homelessness, language barriers, or
  cultural isolation. That’s why our partnership with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ayanmaternitylove.org/\"
  target=\"_blank\"><strong>Ayan Maternity Healthcare Support</strong></a>, founded
  by longtime doula and advocate&nbsp;Ayan Abdulahi, is so vital for the families
  we serve.</p><p class=\"\">Ayan’s work is deeply personal. Carrying on the legacy
  of her mother, she has been supporting women through childbirth for nearly 30 years.
  When she arrived in the U.S., she saw an urgent need for more doulas, especially
  for immigrant, refugee, and low-income families. She founded Ayan Maternity Healthcare
  Support to fill that gap, ensuring that every woman—regardless of her circumstances—receives
  the guidance, advocacy, and care she deserves.</p><p class=\"\">Unlike medical providers,
  doulas don’t deliver babies or prescribe treatment. Instead, they walk alongside
  families throughout pregnancy, birth, and postpartum—providing education, emotional
  support, and advocacy. A doula is often the person who knows a mother best, visiting
  her home, speaking her language, and building trust. As Dominique Alex, CEO of Mary’s
  Place, shared, “It’s like having a coach and a partner—someone who helps you feel
  seen, heard, and supported every step of the way.”</p><p class=\"\">Through our
  partnership, Ayan and her team provide doula services, maternal education classes,
  and even free doula training workshops for women in our shelters. These classes
  don’t just cover labor—they also address maternal mental health, postpartum recovery,
  and even include joyful activities like music to build community.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

Mary's Place has partnered with Ayan Maternity Healthcare Support, founded by Ayan Abdulahi, to provide essential support for pregnant women, particularly those facing homelessness, language barriers, or cultural isolation. Ayan, a dedicated doula with nearly 30 years of experience, aims to ensure that every woman receives the guidance and care she deserves throughout pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum. Doulas offer emotional support, education, and advocacy, acting as trusted partners for mothers.

The partnership offers various services, including doula support, maternal education classes, and free training workshops for women in shelters. These initiatives address not only labor but also maternal mental health and postpartum recovery, fostering community through activities like music. For high-risk pregnancies, Ayan’s team has developed resources such as screening tools to help moms monitor their health.

This initiative is crucial, as Black women in the U.S. face significantly higher risks of pregnancy-related complications. Ayan’s culturally competent care is working to reduce these disparities. By providing access to critical healthcare and fostering a supportive community, this partnership empowers mothers during vulnerable times, ensuring they have the chance for safe and healthy births.
