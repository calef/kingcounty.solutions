Mary's Place has partnered with Ayan Maternity Healthcare Support, founded by Ayan Abdulahi, to provide essential support for pregnant women, particularly those facing homelessness, language barriers, or cultural isolation. Ayan, a dedicated doula with nearly 30 years of experience, aims to ensure that every woman receives the guidance and care she deserves throughout pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum. Doulas offer emotional support, education, and advocacy, acting as trusted partners for mothers.

The partnership offers various services, including doula support, maternal education classes, and free training workshops for women in shelters. These initiatives address not only labor but also maternal mental health and postpartum recovery, fostering community through activities like music. For high-risk pregnancies, Ayan’s team has developed resources such as screening tools to help moms monitor their health.

This initiative is crucial, as Black women in the U.S. face significantly higher risks of pregnancy-related complications. Ayan’s culturally competent care is working to reduce these disparities. By providing access to critical healthcare and fostering a supportive community, this partnership empowers mothers during vulnerable times, ensuring they have the chance for safe and healthy births.
