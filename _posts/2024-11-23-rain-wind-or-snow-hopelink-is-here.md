  \"Rain, Wind, or Snow - Hopelink is Here 5\")\n\n###### Online donations will support
  families recovering from bomb cyclone damage\n\nAs howling winds from this week’s
  bomb cyclone&nbsp;swept across the Cascade foothills, damage to powerlines left
  over 640,000 households across western Washington in the dark on the morning of
  Wednesday, Nov. 20. Hopelink’s service area of north and east King County saw some
  of the most significant storm damage.&nbsp;As hours passed, refrigerators and freezers
  grew warmer, and people were forced to toss away spoiled perishable goods.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nLosing
  food and going without heat for days puts a strain on everyone. But for low-income
  families already struggling with food insecurity, this loss is more than just an
  inconvenience – it’s a setback that can take weeks to recover from. As a result,
  many are turning to Hopelink for help. But, we need your support to meet this increased
  demand during an already busy holiday season.&nbsp;\n\n“Weather events, like this
  bomb cyclone, highlight the resiliency of our community and also the huge risks
  for people without enough,” said Meghan Altimore, Hopelink Interim CEO. “On Thursday,
  as power came back on, it was joyous to watch shoppers leave our Food Markets with
  full carts to replace the food that went bad. But there are tens of thousands of
  households still in our community without power who will not have the resources
  to replace all that they lost.”\n\nAdditionally, with schools closed, many parents
  stayed home from work to take care of their children. For workers without paid time
  off, this meant sacrificing a day’s – or several days – of pay.&nbsp;\n\n“Support
  from agencies like Hopelink will be more important than ever in coming weeks as
  families work to recover from lost food and wages,” Meghan continued.&nbsp;\n\n<section

  morning, Hopelink staff members sprang into action to support families through the
  power outage, including by protecting thousands of pounds of food in Hopelink’s
  food warehouse.&nbsp;\n\n“That food is like gold and we’ve got to protect it at
  all costs,” said Jodi Peña, Hopelink Food Program Manager.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nCold foods
  were loaded into Hopelink’s refrigerated vehicles and transported to Food Lifeline,
  Northwest Harvest, and Charlie’s Produce for temporary storage. Grocery rescue operations
  were spread out across Hopelink’s Redmond and Bellevue locations so there would
  be additional food items available when the Food Markets reopened on Thursday.&nbsp;\n\n![Image

  \"Rain, Wind, or Snow - Hopelink is Here 6\")\n\nJust days before the Thanksgiving
  holiday, Hopelink’s Food Program team anticipates an increase of shoppers looking
  to not only replenish what food was lost in the storm, but to gather fixings for
  a warm holiday meal. From November through December, in addition to usual staples
  and fresh foods, Hopelink offers culturally relevant seasonal goods. At each Market,
  staff and volunteers have decorated festive tables stocked with cranberry sauce,
  pumpkin puree, warming spices, masa, matzo meal, and more holiday favorites.\n\nAs
  the lights came back on and Hopelink Food Markets reopened on Thursday, the residents
  at the Housing program’s seven sites were still without power. Next door to Avondale
  Park, Meadowbrook Church helped make sure residents had a hot meal by stopping by
  with a generous delivery of fresh pizza.&nbsp;\n\nAs his Seattle neighborhood received
  little storm damage, Hopelink Director of Communications Cade Schmidt scavenged
  area stores and filled his car with flashlights, batteries, HotHands packs, Cups
  of Noodles, and hot water while Food Assistance program staff assembled meal bags.
  Navigating dark stoplights and debris-filled roadways, Schmidt and Housing program
  staff couriered supplies to the various sites.&nbsp;\n\n“While we were unloading
  my car at Kenmore Place, the lights came on and we could hear families in their
  units cheering all the way down the hall,” said Schmidt.&nbsp;\n\nSadly, the lights
  flickered and went dim again shortly after. As of Friday afternoon, residents at
  Kenmore Place are still without power. Residents have been provided extra blankets
  and directed to nearby warming shelters. After she regained power at her own home
  on Thursday night, Hopelink Vice President of Development, Marketing, & Communications
  Melissa Pederson dropped by Kenmore Place Friday night with hot pizza and breakfast
  for Saturday morning.\n\n“This week, as many of us sought refuge from cold homes
  in restaurants or movie theaters, drove to a friend’s house for a warm shower, or
  made a trip to the grocery store to replace the food we lost – we can’t forget about
  our neighbors who don’t have these options,” said Malory Gustave, Hopelink Vice
  President of Community Services. “Without our community’s support in providing food,
  flashlights, hot water, snacks, and pizzas, many of our neighbors would have lacked
  these necessities. November and December are already the busiest months of the year
  for many of our programs, as utility costs increase, and the holiday season puts
  additional strain on families. Hopelink is dedicated to assisting everyone in need
  during the winter, but we rely on the support of our community to make this possible.”\n\nAs
  families recover, online donations will provide a critical infusion for the Hopelink
  programs our neighbors depend on. With an **[<mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0,

  of any amount</mark>](https://fundraise.hopelink.org/give/547961/#!/donation/checkout)**,
  Food Assistance program staff can make grocery store runs to replenish Food Market
  shelves, Facilities staff can ensure each unit remains warm and cozy, and people
  who lost wages may apply for Financial Assistance so they can make their next rent
  payment.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nRain, wind, or snow, Hopelink will always be here for our
  neighbors – and that’s thanks to a community that continually shows up for us.&nbsp;\n\n<style>\n.single-post
