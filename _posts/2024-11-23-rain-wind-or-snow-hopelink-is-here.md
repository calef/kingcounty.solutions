Hopelink, a Washington-based community organization, is providing additional food and support to those affected by a recent bomb cyclone that left over 640,000 households without power in the area. Many families lost perishable goods due to the outage and have turned to Hopelink for assistance. The organization's staff have been proactive in protecting food at their warehouse, distributing it to those in need, and providing support to families during the power outage. They have also made an appeal for online donations to help people recover from lost food and wages, and to support their ongoing programs.
