To assist Bellevue residents during the Republic Services work stoppage, an additional waste drop-off date has been scheduled for Saturday, July 19, at Odle Middle School from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Residents can bring bagged garbage, recycling, and compost materials. They should anticipate long wait times that may affect local traffic. If the work stoppage persists, more drop-off dates will be announced. For ongoing updates, residents can visit RepublicBellevue.com. The city has established an online Frequently Asked Questions page to keep the community informed about this situation and will continue to update it as new information arises. Residents can direct any inquiries to solidwaste@bellevuewa.gov.
