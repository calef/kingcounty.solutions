  <p>Next, the Speech Therapy team helped children practice <strong>communication skills for trick-or-treating</strong>. Whether through verbal words, AAC (alternative and augmentive communication) buttons, or sign language, every child found their own way to say &#8220;Happy Halloween&#8221;, “Trick or treat!” and “Thank you!” A parent shared afterward, <em>“My child said that they learned different ways to get trick or treats, and they seemed to feel more excited and less stressed about the events.”</em></p>
