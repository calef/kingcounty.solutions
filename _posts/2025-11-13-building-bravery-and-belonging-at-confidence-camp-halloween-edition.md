Encompass hosted Confidence Camp: Halloween Edition to help neurodiverse children, ages 3-10, prepare for Halloween, addressing nerves around trick-or-treating. The camp featured activities led by mental health and therapy professionals, including a "Halloween Feelings Check-In" and communication skills training for trick-or-treating. Children engaged in the Candy Dish Challenge to enhance fine motor skills and self-control while exploring coping strategies during a "Spooky Decorations Walk." The event concluded with a Halloween Parade where kids showcased their costumes and newfound confidence. The camp emphasized that every child can enjoy Halloween with the right tools for communication and self-regulation.
