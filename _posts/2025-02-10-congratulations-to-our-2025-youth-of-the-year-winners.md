Congratulations to the 2025 Youth of the Year winners, Youseff and Adele, recognized for their exceptional service and leadership at the Boys & Girls Clubs of King County. The awards ceremony, held on February 8, celebrated 10 outstanding candidates with over 200 community members in attendance. Youseff, from the Kirkland Club, began his journey in second grade and has become a mentor and Youth Development Professional, aiming to lead the organization as president. Adele, from the Mercer Island Club, has created an inclusive environment while enhancing her leadership through advocacy and volunteerism. 

Jaxon, from the Federal Way Teen Center, was named the 2025 Youth of the Year. A member since the age of eight, he leads community initiatives such as feeding the homeless and promoting mental health awareness. His aspiration to become an architect aligns with his goal of providing housing solutions for the homeless. Teen Director Angel Mulivai-Tobin praised Jaxon as a natural leader and role model. Jaxon will represent the organization at the Washington State Boys & Girls Club Youth of the Year competition. The event highlighted the profound impact of the Clubs on youth development and community engagement.
