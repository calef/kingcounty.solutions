At the recent City Council meeting, a significant update to Bellevue's strategic diversity, equity, and inclusion plan, known as the Diversity Advantage Plan 2035, was discussed. This plan aims to enhance access to city services and positively impact the diverse communities in Bellevue. The city engaged with the community and staff to develop this plan, which includes 41 long-term equity objectives aligned with existing city priorities. The council will review the final plan in a future meeting.

Additionally, the council received updates on proposed amendments to the city’s sign code, focusing on modernizing sign design and simplifying regulations based on community feedback. Engagement efforts included multilingual surveys and listening sessions, revealing strong community support for regulating temporary signage in residential areas. The sign code update will proceed to a drafting phase with further public outreach planned, with a complete draft expected for council consideration in 2026.

The council also proclaimed November 29 as Small Business Saturday, encouraging residents to support local businesses, which constitute 97% of Bellevue's economy. The proclamation was accepted by the owner of Monserrate Colombian Cuisine, representing the local small business community.
