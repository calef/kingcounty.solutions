original_content: "Hispanic Heritage Month is a time to honor the histories, cultures,
  and contributions of Americans whose ancestry traces back to Spain, Mexico, the
  Caribbean, and Central and South America. At Snoqualmie Valley Health, we join the
  national celebration by recognizing the ways Hispanic and Latino individuals have
  advanced medicine, healthcare, and patient wellbeing.\n\n#### Honoring Hispanic
  and Latino Healthcare Leaders\n\nHispanic and Latino healthcare professionals have
  long been at the forefront of innovation and compassionate care. One notable example
  is Dr. Antonia Novello, the first woman and the first Hispanic to serve as U.S.
  Surgeon General.\n\nAppointed in 1990, Dr. Novello championed efforts to improve
  health outcomes for women, children, and minority communities. Her work emphasized
  education around HIV/AIDS prevention and programs to reduce tobacco use among young
  people.\n\nReflecting on her career, Dr. Novello once said:  \n_“I want to be remembered
  simply as a woman who cared for people and did everything she could to make a difference.”_\n\n####
  Continuing the Legacy of Inclusive Care\n\nToday, Hispanic and Latino healthcare
  providers continue that legacy, serving patients with cultural insight and dedication.
  Locally and nationally, their voices enrich research, patient advocacy, and the
  delivery of inclusive care.\n\n#### How to Celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month\n\nAs
  we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month, we encourage our community to:\n\n- Attend
  cultural events\n\n- Explore stories that highlight Hispanic contributions\n\n-
  Thank the providers and caregivers of Hispanic heritage who serve our community
  each day\n\n#### Building a Healthier, More Connected Community\n\nTogether, we
  can celebrate diversity, build understanding, and strengthen the connections that
  keep us healthy.\n\nThe post [Hispanic Heritage Month: Honoring Contributions to
