In a heartfelt message, Shalimar Gonzales, CEO of Solid Ground, addresses the pressing challenges faced by marginalized communities, particularly immigrants, LGBTQ individuals, and BIPOC populations. She expresses the fear and anger that many feel in response to recent threats from the federal government, including executive orders and funding cuts that jeopardize vital services for vulnerable neighbors. Gonzales emphasizes the need for courage in these times, asserting Solid Ground's unwavering commitment to countering racism and oppression. Despite facing potential cuts to federal funding, which could significantly impact their ability to provide essential support in King County, Solid Ground plans to enhance community partnerships and services, like food access and behavioral health support. Gonzales calls for solidarity and courage from the community to resist these threats and ensure that Solid Ground remains steadfast in its mission, regardless of the challenges ahead. She concludes by urging everyone to stand together, highlighting the importance of courage during such critical moments.
