  <p>We sold 600 servings of Strawberry Shortcake, as well as delicious Strawberry Lemonade and quilt raffle tickets. Thank you to Delores Ulrich, Leslie &amp; Charles Day, and Diane Amos, for coming to the senior center early in the morning to get the shortcake ready, as well as all of the volunteers who served shortcake, cleared tables, and cashiered in the lobby.

Thank you to everyone who supported our Fourth of July event! Chefs Jim Ribail and Daniel Enciso prepared more than 175 spaghetti dinners, while volunteers assisted in various roles, including kitchen help and raffle ticket sales. Local businesses provided generous support, and we sold 600 servings of strawberry shortcake, accompanied by strawberry lemonade. Special thanks to the volunteers who helped prepare and serve the shortcake, as well as our sponsors.

Looking ahead, our Anniversary Committee has planned several events for September, including fashion shows and a '70s music night on September 12. On September 29, we will share stories and memories from the past century.

We are also excited to announce our annual dinner and auction on October 11 at the Club at Snoqualmie Ridge. Tickets are available for $85 per person or $800 for a table of ten, with VIP options at $105 each. We are seeking item donations, such as gift cards and experiences, and volunteers to help with the event. For questions or to get involved, please contact me directly.
