title: Los Angeles wildfires prompted significantly more virtual medical visits, UW-led
  research finds
topics: []
---

Research led by the University of Washington and Kaiser Permanente Southern California reveals a significant increase in virtual medical visits following the January 2025 wildfires in Los Angeles. During the week after the fires, there was a 42% rise in virtual healthcare visits for respiratory symptoms among Kaiser Permanente members. Those living near burn zones saw even higher increases: 44% for respiratory and 40% for cardiovascular virtual visits. The study analyzed health records of 3.7 million members, estimating over 15,000 additional cardiovascular and nearly 28,000 respiratory virtual visits during this period. The findings indicate that virtual healthcare becomes a crucial resource during climate-related emergencies, as many individuals opted for online consultations due to evacuation orders and poor air quality. In addition to respiratory and cardiovascular visits, there was also a notable rise in injuries and neuropsychiatric symptoms, with outpatient injury visits up by 18% among those highly exposed to the fires. This research emphasizes the need for healthcare systems to enhance their virtual care capabilities in preparation for future climate disasters, ensuring they can effectively respond to surges in healthcare demand during such emergencies.
