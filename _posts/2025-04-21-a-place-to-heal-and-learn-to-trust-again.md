  <p>Talia is the one who made that all happen, but she’ll tell you that it only became possible three and half years ago when she decided to call Solid Ground’s <a href="https://www.solid-ground.org/our-impact/housing-homelessness/#broadview">Broadview Shelter and Transitional Housing</a> for domestic violence (DV) survivors.</p>
  <p>“This is somewhere where for the first time, I felt safe,” says Talia. “Somewhere where no one was going to hurt me, and I wasn’t going to have to fight. Where I could say, ‘I need advice. I need resources.’”</p>
  <h4 class="tmc-medium"><span style="color: #4d5909;">Returning to a ‘sanctuary’</span></h4>
  <p>Every day, thousands of people in the U.S. make the courageous decision to leave a harmful relationship, often giving up a home, belongings, financial stability, and community to do so. Many survivors don’t know where to turn for support, which is why studies show that 22% to 57% of homelessness among women is the direct result of domestic violence.<span class="tmc-serif-subhead" style="color: #ed7a09;">¹</span></p>
  <p>This wasn’t the case for Talia when she decided to do whatever it took to get her boys away from an abusive partner. Instead, she knew exactly where she could turn for help – because her mother had done the same thing.</p>

  <p>“It was really our first sanctuary away from domestic violence – that was very much ingrained in me even with how young I was,” says Talia, now 27. “I remembered that it was a safe place, one that me and my children could go to if need be. It was something I always kept in my back pocket.”</p>
  <p>Talia was about 10 years old and receiving treatment for a heart defect at Children’s Hospital when she and her mother sought shelter at Broadview, which has served as a safe haven for thousands of DV survivors in the decades since it was founded in 1983. The two later lived for a while at Solid Ground’s Sand Point Housing, just down the road from the hospital.</p>
  <p>More than a decade later, memories of the Broadview building still lingered in Talia’s mind when she became a young mother and experienced abusive relationships herself. She was determined, however, that her children would not experience living in a shelter, in part because she feared she might lose them.</p>
  <p>But eventually, it became the only option. “I called and I was like, ‘Hey, I can’t do this, I need help,” she says. “They were so welcoming. They took us up to our room, and one of the workers brought us toys and a Pack ’n Play. She just looked at me and said, ‘You’re OK.’”</p>

Her oldest son, who had few opportunities to interact with other children as a toddler during the COVID pandemic, arrived at Broadview with extreme behavioral challenges that included screaming fits and biting.</p>
  <p>So Broadview staff helped Talia meet with school staff to develop an individualized education program (IEP), connected him with a pediatrician and therapist, involved him in skill-building children’s programs, and created opportunities for parents and children at Broadview to share joyful, healing moments together.<span class="tmc-serif-subhead"><strong><span style="color: #ed7a09;">²</span></strong></span></p>
  <p>The impact on her oldest son, Talia said, has been astonishing. “He’s an amazing kid, and he’s grown so much from where we were a couple of years ago,” she says. “He’s outgoing. He’s kind. He will talk your ear off for a solid hour about animal facts or Pokémon facts. At school, they talk about how he’s so kind and calm and just a social butterfly.”</p>
  <p>Talia found opportunities for growth and healing for herself as well. She bonded with other mothers over their shared experiences, took financial education classes to better manage her money, met with a therapist, and learned from staff how to practice “gentle parenting with boundaries.” And perhaps most importantly, Talia learned to spot the signs of unhealthy relationships – and how to avoid them.</p>
  <blockquote class="tmc-quote"><p><span style="color: #4d5909;">“Because of Broadview, I was able to know what to look for, and for the first time in my life, I’m in a healthy, happy relationship. I feel like Broadview opened up the door for us to be able to start to trust people again.”</span></p>

  <p>More than a decade later, memories of the Broadview building still lingered in Talia’s mind when she became a young mother and experienced abusive relationships herself. She was determined, however, that her children would not experience living in a shelter, in part because she feared she might lose them.</p>
  <p>“When you grow up in DV situations or abusive situations, no one tells you how to not get back in them, or what to look out for,” she says. “At Broadview, they’re kind of like, ‘Hey, this is what you need to look out for, and this is how you set boundaries.’”</p>
  <p>So not long after Talia moved out of Broadview and into a new apartment – with the help of Broadview staff and a Housing Choice Voucher<span class="tmc-serif-subhead" style="color: #ed7a09;">³</span> – Talia met a new partner. They’re now expecting a daughter in August – and planning a wedding for next year.</p>

Talia, a 27-year-old mother, reflects on her journey from chaos to calm after seeking help at Solid Ground’s Broadview Shelter and Transitional Housing for domestic violence survivors. Having experienced cycles of homelessness and abuse in her youth, she was determined to provide a stable life for her two young sons and her unborn daughter. Three and a half years ago, she reached out to Broadview, recalling it as a safe haven from her childhood when she and her mother sought refuge there. 

At Broadview, Talia received essential support for her family, including educational resources for her son, who struggled with behavioral challenges, and opportunities for personal growth. Talia engaged with other mothers, participated in financial education, and learned about healthy relationships and parenting skills. This support helped her transform her life, leading to her being in a healthy relationship and gaining the confidence to trust again. Talia's journey illustrates the profound impact of community support on survivors of domestic violence, showcasing Broadview as a sanctuary for healing and rebuilding lives.
