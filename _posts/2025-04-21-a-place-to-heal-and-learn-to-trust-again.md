Talia, a 27-year-old mother, reflects on her journey from chaos to calm after seeking help at Solid Ground’s Broadview Shelter and Transitional Housing for domestic violence survivors. Having experienced cycles of homelessness and abuse in her youth, she was determined to provide a stable life for her two young sons and her unborn daughter. Three and a half years ago, she reached out to Broadview, recalling it as a safe haven from her childhood when she and her mother sought refuge there. 

At Broadview, Talia received essential support for her family, including educational resources for her son, who struggled with behavioral challenges, and opportunities for personal growth. Talia engaged with other mothers, participated in financial education, and learned about healthy relationships and parenting skills. This support helped her transform her life, leading to her being in a healthy relationship and gaining the confidence to trust again. Talia's journey illustrates the profound impact of community support on survivors of domestic violence, showcasing Broadview as a sanctuary for healing and rebuilding lives.
