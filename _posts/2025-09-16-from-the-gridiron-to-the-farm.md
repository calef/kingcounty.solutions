  \" 2025 Reaching Out Celebration Keynote Speaker, Jason Brown\")\n_30th Annual Reaching
  Out Celebration Keynote Speaker, Jason Brown_\n\nHopelink is proud to welcome Jason
  Brown as the keynote speaker for the [30th Annual Reaching Out Celebration](https://www.hopelink.org/events/reaching-out-celebration/).
  Jason’s journey is one of faith, resilience, and remarkable transformation. Once
  a successful NFL offensive lineman, Jason made headlines not for a touchdown or
  a contract deal, but for what he chose to leave behind. At the height of his professional
  football career, he walked away from the league to follow a calling rooted in service
  and compassion, establishing _First Fruits Farm_ in Louisburg, North Carolina. There,
  Jason and his family have grown and donated more than 2 million pounds of fresh
  food to fight hunger in communities that need it most.&nbsp;\n\nJason’s story mirrors
  the values at the heart of Hopelink’s work, particularly the importance of access
  to healthy, nutritious food. Just as _First Fruits Farm_ was founded on the belief
  that no one should go hungry, Hopelink’s [Food Assistance program](https://www.hopelink.org/programs/food-program/)
  supports individuals and families through five no-cost markets and a [mobile market](https://www.hopelink.org/programs/food-program/mobile-market/)
  that brings nutritious food directly into underserved neighborhoods. Through these
  programs, Hopelink provides not only nourishment but dignity and choice.&nbsp;\n\n![Image

  \"From the Gridiron to the Farm 2\")\n\nIn many ways, Jason’s mission also aligns
  with Hopelink’s [Harvest program](https://www.hopelink.org/programs/food-program/harvest-program/),
  which purchases and gleans fresh, local produce from nearby farms, farmers’ markets,
  and gardens for distribution through Hopelink Food Markets. Hopelink Harvest purchased
  an estimated 77,211 pounds of produce from local farms, helping combat food insecurity
  with healthy options that might otherwise be out of reach for many families. Like
  Jason’s work at _First Fruits Farm_, Hopelink Harvest is about building a bridge
  between abundance and need.&nbsp;\n\n_A day of gleaning radishes and strawberries

  Out Celebration, this milestone event is stepping into a new chapter, transforming
  into an evening event that brings our community together around shared stories and
  a vision of a community free of poverty. Held at the Meydenbauer Center on October
  16, 2025, the event will feature personal stories from those who’ve used Hopelink’s
  services and staff members, all while offering a deeper look into the work we do
  year-round to meet basic needs and build lasting stability.&nbsp;\n\nWhether you’re
  a long-time supporter or joining us for the first time, this year’s Reaching Out
  Celebration promises to inspire. Jason Brown’s keynote will highlight how purpose-driven
  action, whether on a farm, at a nonprofit, or at a Community Action Agency can sow
  the seeds of real, lasting change. His story reminds us that service often starts
  with a simple question: “What do I have to give?”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n<style>\nfigcaption

Hopelink will provide extra food during visits to its Food Markets starting November 3. The organization welcomes Jason Brown, former NFL offensive lineman who left his career to establish First Fruits Farm, as the keynote speaker for its 30th Annual 'Reaching Out' Celebration. Brown's farm has donated over 2 million pounds of fresh food to communities in need.
