  Are you a member of a BIPOC community who feels unseen in the mental health care system? _You are not alone_. The BIPOC community is not a monolith, and your experiences with your identity are unique—as are your experiences with systemic oppression and barriers to accessing appropriate care. Many psychologists today agree that culture and community represent a key pillar to our mental health; when finding care, if a provider does not consider these elements, they are missing a huge part of the picture. Culturally competent or appropriate care can make a huge difference in creating a comfortable and healthy environment to support you in your mental health journey.

  In navigating our mental health journeys, it’s important to seek out support from someone who understands your cultural and racial identities and incorporates this understanding into your care. Whether you want to find a therapist who looks like you and shares your experience, or someone specializing in culturally responsive care, we are here for you as you search.

  According to the social work department at [Simmons University and the National Alliance on Mental Illness](https://online.simmons.edu/blog/racial-disparities-in-mental-health-treatment/), 56% of white healthcare providers report having no form of cultural competency training. The [American Psychological Association](https://www.apa.org/workforce/data-tools/demographics) states that in 2021, over 80% of psychologists were white. Everyone is different; it is valid to only feel comfortable with a provider who shares identities with you. However, there are options for finding an understanding and well-informed provider that may share a different background.

  If you are in the process of finding a therapist now and need a place to start,&nbsp; the directories we discussed in our [4 Common Barriers to Accessing Mental Health Treatment and Ways to Address Them](https://www.crisisconnections.org/4-common-barriers-to-accessing-mental-health-treatment-and-ways-to-address-them/) post can help you connect with someone who understands and gets where you are coming from.

  If you find a therapist who specializes in the mental health topics you are looking for support with, there are ways for you to assess if they have the level of understanding they need to support you. When you find a therapist you like and have a phone call to ask them some questions, here are some examples that can help you assess their cultural competence and understanding, from [Culturally Competent Therapist: How to Find a Culturally Competent Therapist Who Really Makes You Feel Heard | SELF](https://www.self.com/story/find-culturally-competent-therapist):

  1. How comfortable do you feel addressing African American issues, and how comfortable do you feel discussing them with me?
  2. What trainings or consultations do you do around Muslim issues?
  3. What do you do to stay on top of culturally competent mental health care?
  4. Do you treat many patients who are LGBTQ+?
  5. Are you trans-affirming?
  6. Are you bi-affirming?
  7. How much antiracism training have you done?
  8. What sorts of culturally specific resources do you refer your patients to?
  9. Will you let me know if you don’t feel you can support me in the way that I need?

The BIPOC community often feels unseen in the mental health care system, facing barriers such as systemic oppression and lack of culturally competent care. Understanding cultural and racial identities plays a crucial role in mental health care. In 2021, over 80% of psychologists were white, and 56% of white healthcare providers reported no cultural competency training. For those seeking therapists, there are directories that can connect you to a culturally competent provider, regardless of their background. Assessing cultural competence is important, and questions to help gauge this understanding are suggested. Several support lines aimed at different communities are also provided.
