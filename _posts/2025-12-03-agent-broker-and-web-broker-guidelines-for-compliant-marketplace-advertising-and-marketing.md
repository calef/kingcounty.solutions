The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) provides guidelines for agents, brokers, and web-brokers regarding compliant advertising and marketing practices for the Health Insurance Marketplace. All advertising and marketing efforts must be truthful, not misleading, and comply with federal and state laws. Agents and brokers are required to use approved materials and must not create their own promotional content that could misrepresent the Marketplace. Marketing efforts should focus on enrollment periods and the importance of obtaining health coverage.

Entities must also ensure that any outreach complies with privacy regulations and that they respect consumers' preferences regarding communication. It is essential for agents and brokers to provide accurate information about plans, focusing on the benefits and coverage options available. The guidelines emphasize the need for transparency, including disclosing any potential conflicts of interest. Furthermore, agents and brokers must ensure that all communications are accessible to people with disabilities and must not use deceptive marketing tactics. Adherence to these guidelines is crucial for maintaining trust and integrity in the Marketplace.
