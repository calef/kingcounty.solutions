On September 25, 2025, over 750 attendees gathered at the Westin Seattle for the 15th Annual Closer to Home Luncheon, hosted by Bellwether Housing and presented by Airbnb. The event, themed "Our Whole Community," raised a record $628,000, the highest in Bellwether’s history, to support affordable housing initiatives and the Resident Services program benefiting over 7,000 residents annually. Residents Ruth and Taryn shared heartfelt stories emphasizing the importance of community and the impact of secure housing on their lives. Keynote speaker Dr. Jamil Zaki highlighted the science of empathy, urging attendees to recognize the inherent kindness within people. He reinforced Bellwether's belief that secure homes empower individuals to care for others. Bellwether CEO Susan Boyd and Board Chair Peter Larsen announced a new capital campaign, aiming to build 1,250 additional affordable homes in King County with a goal of $12 million. The event showcased the potential of collective action and the shared vision of a future where everyone in the Greater Seattle area has a place to call home.
