  with CDC’s Advisory Committee’s change to decades-long vaccine recommendation that
  has reduced pediatric hepatitis B infections by 99 percent</h2>\n\n<p><strong>OLYMPIA</strong>
  – The West Coast Health Alliance (WCHA) strongly supports that hepatitis B vaccination
  continue to be routinely offered to all newborns, with the first dose of the vaccine
  given within 24 hours of birth for newborns weighing at least 2,000 grams (4 pounds,
  7 ounces), followed by completion of the vaccine series. This recommendation aligns
  with trusted national medical organizations including the <a href=\"https://publications.aap.org/aapnews/news/33914/ACIP-vote-on-hepatitis-B-vaccine-delayed-amid\">American
  Academy of Pediatrics</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/programs/immunization-infectious-disease-public-health/maternal-immunization-task-force/comments-to-cdc-advisory-committee-on-the-importance-of-guidance-for-maternal-and-infant-immunization\">American
  College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.idsociety.org/~/link/32d1b62e77d74a7c9e19fd74f784e9e8.aspx\">Infectious
  Diseases Society of America</a>.<strong> </strong></p>\n\n<h3>ACIP’s Change to Hepatitis
  B Immunization Lacks Credible Evidence</h3>\n\n<p>The Advisory Committee on Immunization
  Practices has voted to end the universal recommendation for hepatitis B vaccination
  for all infants at birth—a strategy that has reduced pediatric hepatitis B infections
  in the United States by 99 percent. The ACIP also voted that parents should consult
  their provider regarding blood tests following each dose of the vaccine series.
  There was no credible evidence presented to support either of these changes. Delaying
  the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine and using blood tests to guide vaccination
  will lead to more children and adults developing preventable liver disease and liver
  cancer with no evidence of a safety benefit.</p>\n\n<p>A review by the Vaccine Integrity
  Project found that the vaccine is safe regardless of when it is given, and there
  are no safety benefits to delaying the first dose. Delaying the first dose increases
  the risk of infection and jeopardizes completion of the full vaccine series, which
  is required for long-lasting protection. Many with chronic hepatitis B do not know
  they are infected, and infants may unknowingly be infected by household and other
  contacts following birth. The birth dose acts as a critical safety net to protect
  newborns from infection. It is not known for how long and how strongly children
  are protected against hepatitis B infection if they don't receive a complete vaccine
  series. The unproven recommendation to obtain blood tests to guide the number of
  hepatitis B shots will subject infants to painful and unnecessary blood draws, increase
  health care costs, delay immunization, and risks decreased protection against infection.
  Completion of the vaccine series has been shown to offer the best protection.</p>\n\n<h3>Importance
  of the Hepatitis B “Birth Dose” Vaccine</h3>\n\n<p>Hepatitis B is a highly infectious
  virus that attacks the liver and can cause chronic liver disease, liver cancer,
  liver failure, and death. It spreads easily — even without visible blood or body
  fluids and can survive on surfaces for up to seven days. Before the United States
  adopted a recommendation for universal infant hepatitis B vaccination in 1991, thousands
  of children were infected each year — both at birth and during childhood. Infants
  and young children are especially vulnerable: up to 90 percent of infants infected
  at birth develop chronic infection and 25 percent of infected children die prematurely
  from hepatitis-related disease.</p>\n\n<p>The hepatitis B vaccine is effective,
  well tolerated, and decades of global data support its safety. It should continue
  to be offered to all parents at birth. Universal vaccination of newborns within
  24 hours of birth, followed by completion of the vaccination series, is essential
  to protecting infants and young children, who are at greatest risk from complications
  from hepatitis B.</p>\n\n<h3>The West Coast Health Alliance</h3>\n\n<p>The West
  Coast Health Alliance was formed to ensure that public health recommendations are
  guided by science, effectiveness and safety at a time when CDC leadership changes,
  reduced transparency and the compromise of key advisory panels have called into
  question the federal government’s capacity to address the nation’s public health
  challenges.</p>\n\n<h3>New WCHA Charter</h3>\n\n<p>WCHA has established a charter
  that lays out the shared principles and scope that guides its work. California,
  Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii formed the West Coast Health Alliance to uphold integrity
  of effective public health strategies to protect the<strong> </strong>health of
  our communities<strong>.</strong> Through this partnership, WCHA will collaborate
  on the review of the best available science and evidence to make unified recommendations
  that support safety, efficacy, transparency, access, and trust.</p>\n\n<h3>WCHA
  Goals and Objectives</h3>\n\n<p>The goals and objectives of the WCHA include the
  following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Work together to ensure the public has access to credible
  information</li>\n\t<li>Coordinate to reduce confusion and increase trust in public
  health</li>\n\t<li>Provide evidence-based position statements, policy recommendations

  protect the health of our communities, the West Coast Health Alliance will work
  to ensure that our public health strategies are based on the best available science.<strong>

The Washington State Department of Health (DOH) and the West Coast Health Alliance, alongside leading national medical organizations, continue to recommend COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters for all eligible individuals. As the fall season approaches, the DOH emphasizes the importance of vaccination to protect against severe illness, hospitalization, and death related to COVID-19. The new bivalent vaccines, effective against the original strain and newer variants, are available to those aged 6 months and older. Health officials highlight that vaccination remains a critical tool in managing the pandemic and reducing transmission rates. They encourage everyone to stay informed and consult healthcare providers about vaccination options. 

Additionally, the DOH stresses the importance of preventive measures such as wearing masks in crowded settings and maintaining good hygiene practices. The ongoing collaboration among health organizations aims to ensure equitable access to vaccines and to address health disparities within communities. As the situation evolves, the DOH remains committed to providing resources and information to support public health efforts and encourage community resilience against COVID-19.
