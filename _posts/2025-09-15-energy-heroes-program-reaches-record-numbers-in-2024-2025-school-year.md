The Energy Heroes educational program achieved record participation in the 2024-2025 school year, engaging 5,185 students across 190 classes in 47 schools. This marks a significant expansion, with over a third of workshops held at schools new to the program. The curriculum, designed for grades 1-12, covers topics such as electrical safety, renewable energy, and conservation, using interactive activities to enhance learning. The program aligns with Seattle's Race and Social Justice Initiative, prioritizing delivery in schools serving under-resourced communities, resulting in 34% of workshops at priority schools. Feedback from 70 teachers was overwhelmingly positive, citing engaging content and effective teaching methods. Teachers appreciated the program's ability to address complex environmental topics in accessible ways. The Energy Heroes program continues to demonstrate the demand for equitable energy education, connecting students with their local utility and fostering a new generation of environmentally conscious citizens. Looking ahead, the program plans to maintain its growth and quality in the upcoming 2025-2026 school year.
