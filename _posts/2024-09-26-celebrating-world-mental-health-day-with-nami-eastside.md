  to create change**. It is a day to break the silence, reduce the stigma, and amplify
  the voices of those struggling with mental health challenges. At NAMI Eastside,
  this day is about advocating for the mental wellness of our friends, families, and
  communities. It’s a chance to recognize that when we speak up—when we choose connection
  over isolation—our actions can ripple far beyond our own circles. As we come together
  to share stories, offer support, and raise awareness, we foster a movement of healing
  that transcends barriers. Join us on October 10th, as we honor World Mental Health
  Day and celebrate the transformative power of connection at our 2024 Gala. Together,
  we can create a future where no one feels alone in their mental health journey.\n\n###
