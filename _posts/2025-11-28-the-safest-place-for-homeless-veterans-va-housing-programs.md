  ## How VA’s “Getting Veterans Off the Streets” initiative helped support unsheltered Veterans

  The safest, healthiest place for homeless Veterans is within VA’s housing programs and supportive services.

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is working to provide safe housing for homeless veterans through its "VA Housing First" initiative. This program prioritizes permanent housing solutions, emphasizing that stable living conditions are crucial for veterans to address other challenges, such as mental health and substance use. VA Secretary Denis McDonough highlighted the importance of this initiative, stating that it creates the "safest place" for veterans. The VA has reported a significant decrease in veteran homelessness, with over 40,000 veterans housed in the past year. The Housing First approach not only offers shelter but also includes supportive services that assist veterans in reintegrating into society. Furthermore, the VA collaborates with local organizations and community partners to enhance its outreach and effectiveness in combating homelessness among veterans. The goal is to ensure that every veteran has a place to call home, ultimately improving their quality of life and well-being. Through these efforts, the VA aims to eliminate homelessness among veterans by providing not just housing but also the necessary resources and support to help them thrive.
