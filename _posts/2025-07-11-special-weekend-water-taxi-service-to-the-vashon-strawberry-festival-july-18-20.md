The King County Water Taxi will provide special service to the Vashon Strawberry Festival from July 18-20. Riders can enjoy four midday sailings from Pier 50 in downtown Seattle to Vashon Island on Friday, July 18, allowing them to explore downtown Vashon before the festival begins. For the first time, the water taxi will operate throughout the entire festival weekend. On Saturday, July 19, and Sunday, July 20, boats will depart every hour starting at 9:00 a.m., with the last trip to Vashon at 6:00 p.m. Return trips will leave Vashon every hour on the half hour. Upon arrival, attendees can connect to the King County Metro Route 118 for easy access to the festival, with additional bus trips added to accommodate increased demand. Adult fares start at $6.75, or $5.75 with an ORCA card, and children 18 and younger can ride for free. The event features a Strawberry Parade, live music, and various strawberry-themed activities, making it a perfect weekend getaway for festival-goers.
