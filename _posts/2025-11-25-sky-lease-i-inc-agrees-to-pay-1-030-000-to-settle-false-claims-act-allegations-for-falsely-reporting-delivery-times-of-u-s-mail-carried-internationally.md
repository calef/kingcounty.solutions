Sky Lease I Inc., an air cargo delivery company based in Miami, has agreed to pay $1,030,000 to settle allegations under the False Claims Act for falsely reporting delivery times of U.S. mail carried internationally. The Justice Department announced the settlement, emphasizing its commitment to ensuring that government contractors fulfill their contractual obligations. According to the allegations, Sky Lease submitted inaccurate electronic scans of mail receptacles to the U.S. Postal Service (USPS), misrepresenting the times at which they transferred possession of the mail. The USPS relies on commercial airlines for the secure and timely delivery of mail to foreign destinations, and Sky Lease was contracted to handle this process. The settlement was achieved through collaborative efforts between the Justice Department's Civil Division and the USPS Office of Inspector General, which investigates compliance issues within mail delivery. It is important to note that the claims resolved by this settlement are allegations only, and there has been no determination of liability.
