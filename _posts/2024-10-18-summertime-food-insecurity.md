original_content: "## Enthusiastic Community Support Offsets Summertime Food Insecurity&nbsp;\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture reports that [28.5 million children](https://schoolnutrition.org/about-school-meals/school-meal-statistics/) across the United States rely on school-sponsored meals. In north and east King County alone, over 17,730 of these children depend on free or reduced-fee school meal programs according to the [Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction](https://kingcounty.gov/en/legacy/depts/health/covid-19/data/impacts/food). When school is out, these kids lose their primary source of daily nutrition.&nbsp;\n\nFor parents, this means an increased financial burden to provide extra meals during the summer months, [especially with rising grocery prices](https://www.bls.gov/regions/west/news-release/consumerpriceindex_seattle.htm).&nbsp;\n\n![Caption: The campaign raised $281,911, exceeding the initial goal by nearly $25,000!](https://www.hopelink.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ESH.24.45-Recap-Blog-Graphic-03.png \"Summertime Food Insecurity  7\")\n_Caption: The campaign raised $281,911, exceeding the initial goal by nearly $25,000! _\n\nHopelink’s annual End Summer Hunger campaign works to bridge this nutritional gap by providing free, nutritious, and kid-friendly foods from June to August. The campaign is fueled by in-kind food donations, food drives, as well as monetary gifts. The campaign surpassed its goal, raising **$281,911 and collecting over 3,500 pounds of food!** “This year’s campaign saw our community show up in a huge way as we more than doubled the number of drives held to end summer hunger,” shared Suzette Hart, Hopelink Development Director, Giving.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nThroughout the campaign, Hopelink recognized how deeply the cause resonated with community members. “Hopelink’s Food Assistance team identified the most needed items, and our drive partners donated many nutritious and easy-to-prepare foods that met our clients’ summer needs,” said Debbie Fellows, Hopelink Development Specialist – Community Engagement.&nbsp;\n\n“Many summer camps and company picnics incorporated a giving element this year, partnering with Hopelink for our campaign,” added Debbie.&nbsp;\n\nThe Finance Families Group at Microsoft hosted a drive for End Summer Hunger. They collected 125 pounds of food and utilized Hopelink’s [Amazon Wishlist](https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/30FK1RUVPWF4Y).&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nHopelink’s Food Assistance team observed a shift in donations this year, from canned goods to more “ready-to-eat” items like rice in pouches, ramen, mac and cheese microwave cups, granola bars, cereal, and oatmeal pouches. Not only are these items helpful for busy parents, but their kids are often able to prepare them themselves.&nbsp;\n\n![Lutheran Calvary Church donated 696 pounds of the most-needed summer food items to Hopelink to fight food insecurity\n](https://www.hopelink.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Calvary-Lutheran-Drive-Photo-3-1-768x1024.jpg \"Summertime Food Insecurity  8\")\n\nAdditionally, youth-based groups such as the Riverview School District contributed through their Knock Down Hunger Cereal Drive, helping keep the [Sno-Valley Market](https://www.hopelink.org/locations/sno-valley/) well-stocked with a variety of cereals.&nbsp;\n\n“Clients expressed their gratitude for the additional food provided during the campaign,” shared Jodi Peña, Hopelink Food Program Manager. “While some clients couldn’t use all the items due to dietary restrictions, we made sure to provide suitable alternatives when possible.”&nbsp;\n\nA local Brownie Troop used a list the Hopelink Food Assistance team prepared of items most needed by families to select and purchase items. They then brought their donations to the [Kirkland Market](https://www.hopelink.org/locations/kirkland-northshore/) – where the Food Assistance program is headquartered.&nbsp;\n\nLutheran Calvary Church donated 696 pounds of the most-needed summer food items to Hopelink.  \nPhoto credit: Debbie Fellows, Hopelink.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n“It was a pleasure to see young donors like the Brownie Troops at our market,” said Jodi. “They took the time to help unload the donations, weigh them, and took a tour of the warehouse to learn more about the program. It was amazing to see their engagement.”&nbsp;\n\n![Riverview School District Food Drive 2](https://www.hopelink.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Riverview-School-District-Food-Drive-2-768x1024.jpg \"Summertime Food Insecurity  9\")\n\n“Organizing these drives involves a lot of physical labor and planning. I’m deeply grateful for the drive partners who approach this work with such joy and dedication,” said Debbie.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nThe enthusiastic support for this campaign helped offset costs for many families as grocery prices remain high, while also generating awareness of summertime food insecurity.&nbsp;\n\n“A well-rounded approach to philanthropy is important as it not only recognizes financial contributions but also engages employees, clients, and their customers, broadening awareness for Hopelink and the services we offer,” shared Melissa Pederson, Hopelink Vice President of Development, Marketing and Communications. “When we support each other, it fosters a sense of belonging and connection, making the community stronger.”&nbsp;\n\nRiverview School District’s cereal donations stocked at the Hopelink Sno-Valley Market.&nbsp;  \nPhoto credit: Maple Weinberg, Hopelink.&nbsp;\n\n### Thank you to our campaign partners\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<script defer>\n\t\t(() => {\n\t\t\tlet article = document.querySelector('.block7527619394932556');\n\n\t\t\tarticle.querySelectorAll('a').forEach(elm => {\n\t\t\t\tif (!elm.href.search(/^(http).+(hopelink.com).+$/)) {\n\t\t\t\t\telm.target = '_blank';\n\t\t\t\t\telm.title = 'Opens in a new tab';\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t});\n\t\t})();\n\t</script>\n\n[![Lakeside Industries](https://www.hopelink.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/lakeside_compressed.png \"Lakeside industries Logo\")](https://lakesideindustries.com)\n\n[![Providence Swedish](https://www.hopelink.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/providince_compressed.png \"Providence Swedish\")](https://www.providence.org/lp/swedish)\n\n[![Arcora](https://www.hopelink.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/acora_compressed.png \"Arcora\")](https://arcorafoundation.org/)\n\n[![PAC Worldwide](https://www.hopelink.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/pac_compressed.png \"PAC Worldwide\")](https://www.pac.com)\n\n<style>\nfigcaption {\n    font-size: 0.8rem !important;\n    margin-top:20px!important;</p>\n<p>}\n.figcaption {\n    font-size: 0.8rem !important;</p>\n<p>}\n</style>\n\n<script defer>\n\t\t(() => {\n\t\t\tlet article = document.querySelector('.block8859906697922832');\n\n\t\t\tarticle.querySelectorAll('a').forEach(elm => {\n\t\t\t\tif (!elm.href.search(/^(http).+(hopelink.com).+$/)) {\n\t\t\t\t\telm.target = '_blank';\n\t\t\t\t\telm.title = 'Opens in a new tab';\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t});\n\t\t})();\n\t</script>"

The campaign raised $281,911 and collected over 3,500 pounds of food, exceeding its goal. Community members donated ready-to-eat items, and several groups held drives to collect food. Hopelink also partnered with summer camps, companies, and youth-based groups for in-kind donations. The campaign not only alleviated the burden of increased meal costs for parents but also raised awareness about summer food insecurity.
