  Kendrie, 2025

  Kendrie was living a happy, carefree childhood when, just after her 4th birthday, everything changed. She was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The diagnosis came suddenly, and her family immediately stepped into action to save her life. Kendrie began treatment right away: 2½ years filled with surgeries, blood transfusions, lumbar punctures, and countless chemotherapy pills and IV infusions.

  Her cancer journey left a lasting impression, but it also ignited a passion to connect with and support others who would one day walk the same difficult path. Even in her hardest moments, Kendrie found strength by looking at how far she had come.
