Nikki and her daughter Sara moved from Louisiana to Washington after a tragic loss due to gun violence. In their new home, Nikki secured stable employment at a fulfillment warehouse, and Sara thrived in school. However, Nikki's health issues led to unpaid time off, resulting in financial strain and ultimately homelessness. For months, they lived in their car, facing harsh conditions while Nikki worked tirelessly to protect her daughter.

Their situation improved when they connected with a mobile outreach team, who provided food, gas cards, and hygiene supplies. More importantly, the team assisted Nikki in finding housing and connected her with support services. With their help, Nikki located an apartment, and Mary’s Place covered the move-in costs. 

Now, Nikki and Sara have a safe home, illustrating a story of resilience and the vital role of community support during challenging times. Their experience emphasizes the importance of outreach programs in helping families navigate hardships and achieve stability.
