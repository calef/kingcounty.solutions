Fireside Home Solutions has initiated a special promotion to support Compass Housing Alliance's efforts against homelessness in the Puget Sound region. From now until March 31, 2025, the company will donate $100 to Compass for each fireplace insert sold. This initiative aims to bolster Compass's work in providing affordable housing, enhanced shelter, and emergency services to those in need. Christopher Ross, President of Compass, highlighted the organization's reliance on community supporters like Fireside, a family-owned business committed to improving lives in the area for over two generations. John Waterstraat, President and CEO of Fireside, expressed that the partnership reflects the company's mission of bringing warmth and comfort into homes while extending that warmth to those facing homelessness. This collaboration showcases the positive impact local businesses can have in their communities, with each insert sold contributing to resources and support for individuals, families, seniors, and veterans striving to overcome homelessness. Fireside Home Solutions continues to uphold its tradition of community engagement while providing services to Puget Sound residents.
