William's early life was filled with chaos and instability due to parental abuse and frequent relocations. At 17, he moved in with his father, who introduced him to a destructive lifestyle involving alcohol and drugs. This led to addiction and legal troubles, culminating in prison time. After being released, he struggled to find employment and housing due to his criminal record, ultimately becoming homeless and overwhelmed by his situation. 

A turning point came when he entered a faith-based rehab program, which helped shift his perspective. Upon release, he found support at Bread of Life Mission, where he began to rebuild his life in a nurturing environment. For the first time, he was encouraged to rest and reflect, participating in Christ-centered classes and counseling focused on relapse prevention. 

Now sober and walking with the Lord, William is committed to giving back by helping steer young people away from drugs. He has also repaired relationships with his family, gaining empathy and understanding the importance of forgiveness. This Easter, he celebrates a renewed life, grateful for the support that has empowered him to embrace his journey and follow Christ’s calling.
