The Seattle Fire Department will conduct live-fire training exercises at a vacant home located at 3502 Meridian Ave. N. in the Wallingford neighborhood on Nov. 24 and 25, from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. This training allows recruits to engage in real fire scenarios under the supervision of veteran firefighters. Residents and businesses in the vicinity have been notified about potential impacts, including road closures within one block of the site for safety. Temporary discoloration of water may occur but is expected to clear within a few hours. Four to six fire evolutions will take place each day, lasting 15 to 20 minutes, and visible smoke will result from controlled burns inside the structure. All hazardous materials have been removed, and only wood fires will be used under strict safety regulations. The smoke produced is similar to that of a fireplace, with steam being visible after the fires are extinguished. Community members are encouraged to observe the training, which will include a break from 12 p.m. to 12:30 p.m. Questions can be directed to the Seattle Fire Department's public information officer.
