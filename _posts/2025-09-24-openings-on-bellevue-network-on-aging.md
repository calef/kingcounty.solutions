The City of Bellevue is seeking new members for the Bellevue Network on Aging, a group dedicated to promoting healthy aging in the community. Interested individuals can apply online until Friday, October 19. The Network on Aging raises awareness about the needs and resources available to older adults as they navigate life transitions, focusing on outreach, collaboration, and community engagement to enhance the well-being of seniors in Bellevue. Members are expected to serve a three-year term, dedicating six to twelve hours per month. To qualify, applicants must live or work in Bellevue, and at least 51% of the group must be over 50 years old. For additional information, interested candidates can reach out to community services supervisor Dan Lassiter at 425-452-4470 or via email.
