The Seattle Office of Housing is inviting applications for requests for qualifications for the development of affordable housing at 14th Avenue South and South Henderson Street in South Park. They seek qualified developers with experience in multifamily and mixed-use projects, particularly those financed through the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. The project aims to create a vibrant community space with affordable apartments and commercial facilities. Nonprofits and women- and minority-owned business developers are encouraged to apply. The submission deadline is Dec. 5, 2025.
