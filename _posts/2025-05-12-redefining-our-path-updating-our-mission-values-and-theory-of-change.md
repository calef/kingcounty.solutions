Hopelink, a community service agency, has updated its mission, values, and Theory of Change after more than 20 years. The new mission is to equip people to exit poverty through comprehensive services, impactful partnerships, and advocacy for equitable opportunities for all, reflecting the agency's commitment to meeting immediate needs and addressing systems that perpetuate poverty. The values, last drafted in 2005, have been redesigned to reflect beliefs in inclusion, growth, community-centeredness, and data-informed stewardship. Additionally, the Theory of Change has been transformed from linear to circular, centering the client journey, and emphasizing flexibility, dignity, and self-determination.
