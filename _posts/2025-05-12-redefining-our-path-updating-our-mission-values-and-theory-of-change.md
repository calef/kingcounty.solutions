original_content: "## Redefining Our Path: Updating Our Mission, Values, and Theory
  of Change\n\nAt Hopelink, our work has always been rooted in the belief that every
  person deserves the opportunity to thrive. But in the face of a rapidly changing
  world, we knew it was time to take a closer look at how we talk about our work —
  and how our guiding frameworks reflect the holistic services we provide today.\n\nOver
  the past 15 months, we engaged in an inclusive and intentional process to update
  our **mission, values,** and **Theory of Change**. We embarked on this effort with
  an overarching commitment: to ensure that the heart of our organization, our values,
  and our purpose are defined by the people who live and breathe our mission daily.\n\nOur
  last mission and values update was over 20 years ago, and our original Theory of
  Change, authored in 2013, had become outdated. We’ve grown in scale, scope, and
  strategy; it was time for our words and models to grow as well.\n\n### Step 1: Reimagining
  Our Mission and Values\n\n**Centering community voice**  \nWe began by surveying
  over 380 team members and facilitating focus groups to ask, “What does Hopelink
  mean to you?” “What values feel true to the way we work?” From those conversations,
  a clear theme emerged: our teams wanted our mission to reflect not just what we
  do – but why and how we do it, with dignity, accessibility, and accountability.\n\n**Updating
  the mission**  \n**Our new mission:** “Hopelink equips people to exit poverty through
  comprehensive services, impactful partnerships, and advocacy for equitable opportunities
  for all” reflects who we are today — an agency deeply committed to meeting immediate
  needs while addressing the systems that perpetuate poverty. It acknowledges the
  agency and power of the individuals and families we serve and centers our work in
  equity, accessibility, and collective impact.\n\nTo ensure the updated mission was
  both inclusive and accessible, we formed a small working cohort to refine the language,
  making sure it could be easily understood and translated into our community’s top
  languages: English, Spanish, Vietnamese, Korean, Portuguese, Chinese, Russian, and
  Ukrainian. We wanted everyone—regardless of language or background—to feel a sense
  of belonging and understand what Hopelink stands for.\n\nOur previous mission, “To
  promote self-sufficiency for all members of our community; to help people make a
  lasting change,” was last revised in 2000 when we changed our name from the Multi-Service
  Center of North and East King County to Hopelink — a name that better reflected
  our growing scope. But since then, our programs have expanded, our understanding
  of systemic poverty has deepened, and our commitment to equity has sharpened, prompting
  this important evolution.\n\n**Redesigning our values**  \nOur values — originally
  drafted in 2005 — also needed refreshing. Our team members wanted aspirational,
  actionable values rooted in their lived experiences while also aligning with our
  anti-poverty mission. Together, we redesigned our values to reflect our belief in
  inclusion, growth, community-centeredness, and data-informed stewardship.\n\n###
  Step 2: Transforming Our Theory of Change\n\n**From linear to circular: centering
  the client journey**  \nAs we reimagined our mission and values, we also looked
  at Hopelink’s Theory of Change: the roadmap that explains how our work creates real
  impact. The original version followed a linear path based on the Self-Sufficiency
  Matrix, which didn’t reflect how people move through our programs. It unintentionally
  suggested that there was a “right” way to receive support when, in truth, everyone’s
  journey is different.\n\nSo, we did what felt right: we brought together a diverse
  group of staff and leaders from across the agency to reimagine the Theory of Change
  while maintaining the foundational pieces that are integral to our community. The
  result? An updated, circular Theory of Change that puts the client at the center,
  highlighting flexibility, dignity, and self-determination every step of the way.\n\n![A
  circular graphic shows the Hopelink client at the center, surrounded by services
  that support stability and help exit poverty. Services include: Financial Assistance,
  Housing with Case Management, Mobility Management, Non-Emergency Medical Transportation,
  Dial-A-Ride Transit, English for Work, Family Development, Financial Capabilities,
  Food Assistance, and Energy Assistance. Below the circle are three pillars: Community
  Education, Advocacy, and Impactful Partnerships.](https://www.hopelink.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/TOC.25.03b-Toc-Files_V2larger-954x1024.png
  \"Circular graphic showing Hopelink’s client-centered services, including food,
  housing, transportation, and education, supported by community education, advocacy,
  and partnerships.\")\n\nThis updated model recognizes that people can come to Hopelink
  at any point in their journey—whether looking for housing, food, education, transportation,
  or financial help to build stability and become equipped to exit poverty. And, how
  when a service falls outside our offering, we connect folks with trusted partners
  who can step in and support.\n\nIn line with our process on the updated mission
  and values, we prioritized equity-centered design—focusing on accessibility through
  thoughtful choices in fonts, spacing, language, and layout. We also ensured that
  the visuals and colors clearly convey our work and are easy to engage with, while
  accurately reflecting the full scope of Hopelink’s impact.\n\n### What’s different
  now and why it matters\n\nHopelink’s updated mission, values, and Theory of Change
  align **every part of our organization** — from frontline service to executive strategy
  — with a shared vision for impact.\n\n- **For staff,** they provide a common language
  and clarity about our purpose, including their stake in it.\n\n- **For clients,**
  they express how Hopelink can support them with clarity and empathy.\n\n- **For
  partners,**  **volunteers, and donors,** they tell a cohesive story about how Hopelink
  creates change at both an individual and community-wide level.\n\nTogether, these
  updates affirm who we are today and ground us in a future guided by equity, accessibility,
  and the lived experiences of our community. By centering our clients and challenging
  the systems that sustain poverty, we’re building a path forward that meets immediate
  needs while driving long-term, systemic change."
