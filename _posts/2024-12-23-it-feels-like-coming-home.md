Christopher Ross has returned to Compass Housing Alliance as president, emphasizing a deep commitment to the organization's mission of supporting vulnerable communities. With a history of serving on the board and as Chief Operating Officer, Ross recognizes the critical need for emergency services and affordable housing amid evolving societal challenges. Compass has provided essential support for over a century, guided by core values of love, compassion, advocacy, and community.

The organization focuses on serving marginalized groups, including the homeless, seniors, low-income families, LGBTQ individuals, immigrants, and veterans, treating everyone with dignity. Ross highlights the profound impact of community champions in maintaining its services and advocates for individual contributions to sustain high standards of care.

A poignant story shared by Ross illustrates the positive change Compass brings, featuring a mother, Heather, who finds hope and belonging in their affordable housing program. Compass aims to be a beacon of support, urging community members to contribute to continue their mission of providing hope and assistance to those in need.
