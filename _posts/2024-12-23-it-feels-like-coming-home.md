  <p>My name is Christopher Ross, and it is my honor to serve as the president of Compass Housing Alliance. Having served on Compass’s board from 2016 to 2017 and as Chief Operating Officer from 2019 to 2021, I feel a deep connection to Compass.</p>



  <p>It is with great enthusiasm and a deep sense of responsibility that I return to this incredible organization in a new capacity. Compass has always held a special place in my heart.</p>



  <p>Our mission of providing emergency services, affordable housing, and support to our community’s most vulnerable is more important now than ever.&nbsp;<strong>The recent changes in our regional and national landscape present new challenges and new opportunities for us to make a meaningful impact.</strong></p>



  <p>While the landscape around us may change, our commitment never wavers. Through wars, recessions, and countless challenges, we’ve stood firm in providing essential services and affordable housing to our neighbors in need for over a century.</p>



  <p><strong>This steadfast dedication has been possible because of community champions like you.</strong></p>



  <p>Our response to uncertainty has always been guided by our foundational values: love, compassion, advocacy, and community. This is who we are and have been since 1920.</p>



  <p><strong>Compass Housing Alliance has always served the most vulnerable and disproportionately underserved members of our society</strong>, including people experiencing homelessness, seniors, low-income and working-class households, members of the LGBTQ community, immigrants, people with mental differences, Veterans, and people who have simply fallen on hard times.</p>



  <p>We treat everyone with dignity and respect and meet them where they are. That will never change. Our impact is profound, and our commitment to our community is unwavering.</p>



  <p>Right now, you have a unique opportunity to take your place among generations of community champions who’ve kept our doors open and our impact alive.

  <p>Together, we can move forward with strength and confidence.</p>



  <p>I’m reminded of a resident who has lived with Compass for many years. Heather is a mother raising her family at one of our affordable housing programs. She was one of the first residents to move into one of our newest buildings, and Heather has seen her children grow up in a community where they have a sense of belonging and safety. She told me, “I wish I had a place like this to grow up in when I was a kid. I’m so glad to have a place like this for my kids. I’m hopeful, and before living here, hope was hard to find.”</p>
