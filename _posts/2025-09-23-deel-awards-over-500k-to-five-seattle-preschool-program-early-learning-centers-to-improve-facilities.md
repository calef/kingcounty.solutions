The Department of Education and Early Learning (DEEL) is distributing approximately $530,000 to five Seattle Preschool Program (SPP) providers for facility improvements. This funding aims to enhance the quality of learning environments for preschool children. Among the recipients are three family child care providers and two child care centers, which will benefit from renovations that allow them to serve more students in safe and nurturing spaces. DEEL Director Dr. Dwane Chappelle emphasized the importance of these investments in fostering quality education for Seattle’s youngest learners. 

Awardees include the Chinese Information and Service Center, which will expand its capacity from one classroom to two, and Ilhan Home Childcare, which plans to enhance its facilities with new flooring and HVAC systems. The SPP Provider Facilities Fund focuses on long-term improvements to support high-quality classrooms, contributing to better school readiness and future educational outcomes. The SPP served 2,355 children in the 2024-25 school year and aims to exceed 2,500 students in the following year. Families can apply for the program, with tuition based on income and family size, and language assistance is available for the application process.
