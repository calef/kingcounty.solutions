  pause and make meaning. This fall marks seven years at Inatai Foundation and the
  start of our <a href=\"https://inatai.org/about/\">50-Year Vision</a>. This vision
  came directly from community leaders and invites us to put all our energy, talent,
  and resources into communities, so they have the power and freedom to shape every
  part of how Washington works—every system and every decision, ensuring equity and
  racial justice in every corner of our state.</p>\n<p>One of <a href=\"https://inatai.org/about/values/\">our
  values</a>, the Seven Generation Principle, guides much of my leadership. It asks
  us to live with one foot in the past and one in the future, honoring the wisdom
  of our ancestors and making choices that strengthen the lives of those who will
  come after us. As a mother to three young people, Zodi, Kekeya, and my little guy
  Editon, I feel this responsibility deeply. They have grown faster than I could have
  believed. They remind me that the future arrives quickly and that every decision
  we make today will ripple into the world they inherit.</p>\n<p>The political moment
  we face is serious. Families across Washington struggle to meet basic needs. Civil
  rights are being challenged in the highest courts. Racism and transphobia are becoming
  far too acceptable. Authoritarianism is here. Yet, I remain grounded by the courage
  of leaders who stand up for justice and belonging in all 39 Washington counties.
  If they are not backing down, then we will not either. As one of the few 501(c)(4)
  funders explicitly focused on racial justice, we have both the responsibility and
  the freedom to support the work that strengthens democracy and builds durable community
  power.</p></div>\n\t\t\t</div><div class=\"et_pb_module et_pb_blurb et_pb_blurb_0

President & CEO Nichole June Maher reflects on her seven years at Inatai Foundation and introduces a 50-Year Vision aimed at empowering Washington communities. This vision prioritizes equity and racial justice, encouraging community leaders to shape systemic changes. Guided by the Seven Generation Principle, Maher emphasizes the importance of making decisions that benefit future generations, particularly her children. Acknowledging current political challenges, including civil rights issues and rising authoritarianism, she remains inspired by local leaders advocating for justice across Washington.

Maher calls for urgent action from influential institutions to support community visions for racial justice. Key initiatives include increasing funding access for diverse communities, particularly those in overlooked areas, and building coalitions to foster long-term change. She highlights the importance of amplifying the creativity and courage found within communities. As Inatai moves forward, Maher envisions a future where Washington fully embraces its young people, ensuring their rights and opportunities. She stresses the need for collective action rooted in courage and care to build a legacy of justice and community power for generations to come.
