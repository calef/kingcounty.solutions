President & CEO Nichole June Maher reflects on her seven years at Inatai Foundation and introduces a 50-Year Vision aimed at empowering Washington communities. This vision prioritizes equity and racial justice, encouraging community leaders to shape systemic changes. Guided by the Seven Generation Principle, Maher emphasizes the importance of making decisions that benefit future generations, particularly her children. Acknowledging current political challenges, including civil rights issues and rising authoritarianism, she remains inspired by local leaders advocating for justice across Washington.

Maher calls for urgent action from influential institutions to support community visions for racial justice. Key initiatives include increasing funding access for diverse communities, particularly those in overlooked areas, and building coalitions to foster long-term change. She highlights the importance of amplifying the creativity and courage found within communities. As Inatai moves forward, Maher envisions a future where Washington fully embraces its young people, ensuring their rights and opportunities. She stresses the need for collective action rooted in courage and care to build a legacy of justice and community power for generations to come.
