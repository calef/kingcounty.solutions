A heartfelt thank you is extended to supporters of LIHI for their generous contributions during the Giving BIG campaign, which raised over $62,000 from 100 donors. This grassroots support has been essential to LIHI's mission for the past 34 years, helping to provide innovative solutions for individuals experiencing homelessness. Donations enable the construction of Tiny House Villages, the operation of Urban Rest Stops offering essential services like showers and laundry, and the development of affordable housing throughout Western Washington. LIHI expresses gratitude for this generosity, highlighting the positive impact these contributions have on creating an equitable future for the communities served. There is still an opportunity to donate, with gifts being matched through May.
