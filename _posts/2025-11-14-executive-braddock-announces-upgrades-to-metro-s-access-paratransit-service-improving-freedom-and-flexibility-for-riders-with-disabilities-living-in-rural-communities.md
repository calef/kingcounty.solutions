King County Executive Shannon Braddock, alongside Metro, has introduced enhancements to the Access paratransit service aimed at improving trip-planning for customers, particularly seniors and individuals with disabilities in rural areas. These improvements include easier reservation processes and better on-time performance. Notably, pilot programs for grocery delivery and same-day reservations are being implemented to increase flexibility and independence for riders. 

Additional support will be provided through community transportation coordinators and navigators to assist customers in accessing Metro services. The new initiatives align with Braddock's '200-Day Plan' to expand transportation options for underserved populations, including the elderly and low-income residents in less densely populated regions. 

The Access paratransit service serves over 960,000 rides annually, indicating its vital role in providing equitable transportation. New contractors will enhance service availability, while the grocery delivery pilot has already enrolled 100 riders, offering free deliveries for a year. This initiative aims to address mobility challenges and enhance overall access to essential services.
