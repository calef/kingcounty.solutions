As the holiday season approaches, King County Metro is providing schedule adjustments for bus, water taxi, and other services to assist travelers attending events, shopping, or gathering with family and friends. For Thanksgiving on November 27, Metro will operate a Sunday schedule, while a regular weekday schedule will be in effect on Black Friday, November 28. Access Paratransit will follow a Sunday schedule on Thanksgiving and a weekday schedule on Black Friday, with no Subscription Service on both days.

On Christmas Day, December 25, all services will run on Sunday schedules, and there will be no Water Taxi service. New Year’s Eve on December 31 will see all transit services operating on regular weekday schedules, with late-night service details to be announced later. New Year’s Day on January 1 will also follow Sunday schedules, with no Water Taxi service.

Travelers are encouraged to use tools like the Trip Planner, text their bus stop number for real-time updates, and sign up for transit alerts. King County Metro offices will be closed during holidays, ensuring a convenient experience for those enjoying the festive season.
