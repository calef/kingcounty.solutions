GiveBIG early giving is now open, allowing donations to be matched up to $75,000 thanks to an anonymous donor. This fundraising initiative supports the Low Income Housing Institute's Tiny House Villages and Urban Rest Stops, which provide effective solutions to homelessness. Last year, more than 1,600 individuals benefited from living in tiny houses, which offer a safe, private space for those often overlooked by traditional shelters, including families and pet owners. LIHI operates 15 tiny house villages, where many residents, with the assistance of case managers, achieve long-term housing.

Urban Rest Stops in downtown Seattle and Ballard provide essential hygiene services, such as showers and laundry facilities, which are crucial for homeless individuals seeking employment and housing. Donors express appreciation for LIHI's impact on the community. Notable supporters include Rev. Joanne from Gethsemane Lutheran Church, who acknowledges the organization's vital role in addressing hygiene needs, and Tree133, a local tree service that recognizes the importance of LIHI's services. Other supporters, including Caryn and Marty from the Youth Development Fund, reaffirm their commitment to aiding in the fight against homelessness in Washington state.
