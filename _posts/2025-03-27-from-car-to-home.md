On average, victims of domestic violence attempt to leave their abusive situations seven times before succeeding. After escaping violence, many face new challenges, including living conditions. One participant from the Atlantic Street Center found herself living in her car due to a low credit score, which deterred landlords from renting to her. The harsh reality for many is choosing homelessness over staying with an abuser, as shelters often have long waiting lists and may not provide long-term support.

Over eight months, staff worked with the survivor to apply for housing. A breakthrough came when a Housing Specialist spoke with a landlord about the participant’s situation, leading to a compassionate decision to rent to her despite her credit issues. The landlord allowed her to move in without an upfront deposit. With additional funding from the Atlantic Street Center to cover moving costs, the participant successfully transitioned into a safe home. Now, she is thriving and building new opportunities. This process, while lengthy, highlights the critical need for community support for individuals escaping domestic violence.
