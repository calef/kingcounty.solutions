The Washington State Department of Commerce received 112 applications for funding aimed at creating or preserving over 6,791 affordable housing units across 23 counties. These applications were submitted in response to funding opportunities from the state’s Housing Trust Fund and the federal National Housing Trust Fund and HOME Rental Development program. Applicants requested more than $538 million, while only $212.4 million is available for the 2025 funding cycle. Award decisions are expected in January, with a focus on serving low-income individuals, including those with disabilities, seniors, and families affected by poverty and racism.
