  Construction will start at Robinswood Park Dec. 1 on new synthetic turf for two sports fields and upgraded field lighting.

  “Robinswood’s fields are the most used in our park system,” said Parks & Community Services Director Michael Shiosaki. “Thanks to the voters who passed the 2022 Parks and Open Space Levy, which is partially funding this project, we are able to keep the facilities in top shape.”

A newly added cricket pitch will add options in sports programming for Bellevue’s diverse population. During construction, most programming will be moved to other fields.

  The Robinswood sports fields are located at 14919 SE 22nd St. In 2025, 35 community groups, including schools, sports organizations and families, made 2,000 field reservations at the two Robinswood sports fields. This is in addition to the city’s youth sports programs and unscheduled drop-in use.

  With a life span of 10 years, the synthetic turf is reaching the end of its life cycle. This spring, the fields will reopen for play. Meanwhile, improved, energy-efficient lights will be placed around the perimeter of the fields.&nbsp;

Construction at Robinswood Park is set to begin on Dec. 1, focusing on installing new synthetic turf for two sports fields and upgrading the field lighting. Parks and Community Services Director Michael Shiosaki noted that these fields are the most utilized in the park system. The project is partially funded by the 2022 Parks and Open Space Levy, thanks to voter support. 

Upon completion in spring, the renovated fields will support various sports, including soccer and lacrosse, and will introduce a new cricket pitch to cater to Bellevue's diverse community. During the construction period, most programs will be relocated to other fields. The sports fields, located at 14919 SE 22nd St., recorded 2,000 reservations from 35 community groups, schools, and families in 2025, alongside additional usage from city youth sports programs. The existing synthetic turf, nearing the end of its 10-year lifespan, will be replaced, and energy-efficient lighting will be installed around the fields' perimeter. The fields are anticipated to reopen for play in the spring.
