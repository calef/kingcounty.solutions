  <p>SAN ANTONIO, TX – This holiday season, national nonprofit Operation Homefront is delivering comfort and joy to thousands of military families across the country. Through its annual <a href="https://operationhomefront.org/holiday-meals-for-military/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Holiday Meals for Military</a>® program, the organization is helping ease the financial burden of what should otherwise be one of the most joyous times of the year by providing meal kits with all the essentials for preparing a traditional holiday meal.  </p>



  <p>Operation Homefront’s Holiday Meals for Military&nbsp;primarily&nbsp;supports&nbsp;junior enlisted military families – grades E-1 through E-6 – as only about a third of this population reports feeling financially stable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Food prices have surged&nbsp;nearly 25%&nbsp;in just the past five years, and this rising cost of living continues to place significant stress on&nbsp;military&nbsp;households.&nbsp;&nbsp;Operation Homefront’s Critical Financial Assistance® program, which provides short-term help for military families facing unexpected financial&nbsp;hardship, has&nbsp;experienced&nbsp;a&nbsp;57%&nbsp;increase in&nbsp;food-related&nbsp;requests&nbsp;in&nbsp;just the last&nbsp;year.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Thanks to the generous support of partners including&nbsp;Asbury Automotive Group,&nbsp;BODYARMOR Sports Drink, Bob &amp; Dolores Hope Foundation, Dollar Tree, Food Lion Feeds, Northrop Grumman, Procter &amp; Gamble,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Town House&nbsp;Crackers,&nbsp;Operation Homefront will&nbsp;distribute&nbsp;holiday meals&nbsp;at dozens of events nationwide, serving more than&nbsp;13,000 families.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p>While food insecurity among the ranks&nbsp;remains&nbsp;stubbornly around 25%, Operation Homefront is working to ensure military families&nbsp;don’t&nbsp;have to choose between paying a bill and creating those special holiday memories that are so often made around the dinner table.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p>“Through our Holiday Meals for Military program, Operation Homefront is stepping in to fill a great and growing&nbsp;need,” says retired Rear Adm. Alan Reyes, President and CEO of Operation Homefront. “A holiday meal that cost $100 to prepare five years ago can easily exceed<s>&nbsp;</s>&nbsp;$125 at the grocery store&nbsp;today.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality for many military families is that inflation is outpacing salary growth.&nbsp;We know there are challenges inherent to the military lifestyle, but food insecurity&nbsp;shouldn’t&nbsp;be one of them.”&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Registration is now open for eligible military families to receive holiday meals nationwide.

This holiday season, Operation Homefront is providing relief to military families through its Holiday Meals for Military® program, which delivers meal kits containing essentials for traditional holiday meals. The initiative primarily supports junior enlisted families (grades E-1 to E-6), as only about one-third of this group feels financially stable. With food prices rising nearly 25% over the past five years, many military households face increased financial strain. The organization’s Critical Financial Assistance® program has seen a 57% rise in food-related requests in the last year alone. Thanks to partners such as Asbury Automotive Group and Procter & Gamble, the program will distribute holiday meals at events across the nation, serving over 13,000 families. Despite food insecurity persisting at around 25% among military families, Operation Homefront aims to help them create cherished holiday memories without the stress of financial burdens. Registration is now open for eligible families to receive holiday meals. Operation Homefront, a nonprofit dedicated to supporting military and veteran families, allocates 83% of its expenditures directly to programs aiding these families, ensuring they can overcome short-term challenges and avoid long-term struggles.
