This holiday season, Operation Homefront is providing relief to military families through its Holiday Meals for Military® program, which delivers meal kits containing essentials for traditional holiday meals. The initiative primarily supports junior enlisted families (grades E-1 to E-6), as only about one-third of this group feels financially stable. With food prices rising nearly 25% over the past five years, many military households face increased financial strain. The organization’s Critical Financial Assistance® program has seen a 57% rise in food-related requests in the last year alone. Thanks to partners such as Asbury Automotive Group and Procter & Gamble, the program will distribute holiday meals at events across the nation, serving over 13,000 families. Despite food insecurity persisting at around 25% among military families, Operation Homefront aims to help them create cherished holiday memories without the stress of financial burdens. Registration is now open for eligible families to receive holiday meals. Operation Homefront, a nonprofit dedicated to supporting military and veteran families, allocates 83% of its expenditures directly to programs aiding these families, ensuring they can overcome short-term challenges and avoid long-term struggles.
