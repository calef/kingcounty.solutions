Praisealujah offers vital services to individuals in need, including food, housing, and recovery programs. The organization encourages community involvement to expand its outreach. A key initiative is the "Church Beyond the 4 Walls" program, which runs a free drivethru food giveaway on the first Sunday of every month at Les Schwab Tire Center in Burien, WA. In addition, Praisealujah hosts regular worship services at New Beginnings Christian Fellowship Church, including Sunday Praise & Worship and an Hour of Power in the evenings. Weekday activities include morning classes focused on praise and counseling and hot meal services for the public. These programs aim to transform hearts, renew minds, and build community, providing a supportive environment for those seeking assistance. Community members are invited to participate and contribute to various events and services that foster connection and support for individuals and families in need.
