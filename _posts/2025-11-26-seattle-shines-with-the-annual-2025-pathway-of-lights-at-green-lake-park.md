The annual Pathway of Lights at Green Lake Park is set to take place on Saturday, December 13, 2025, from 4:30 to 7:30 p.m. This free winter event invites families to enjoy a magical stroll along the illuminated paths and docks, adorned with thousands of candles. Attendees can savor complimentary refreshments and live music from local schools and community groups. The event will also feature hot air balloons, weather permitting. Organized by Seattle Parks and Recreation in collaboration with the Green Lake Advisory Council and various community partners, the event relies on volunteers for setup, luminary placement, and cleanup. Individuals interested in volunteering can sign up online. In the spirit of giving, attendees are encouraged to bring non-perishable food donations for FamilyWorks, to be dropped off at designated music stages. Given the expected turnout, parking around the park is limited, and attendees are urged to consider alternative transportation options such as biking, walking, or using public transit to avoid congestion.
