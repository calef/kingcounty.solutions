Last October, DAV hosted its latest Patriot Boot Camp at the National Headquarters, welcoming 45 military and veteran founders, including spouses, for a transformative three-day experience. Participants engaged in extensive learning sessions covering topics from business development to AI, while honing their elevator pitches and networking with peers. The event featured 46 seasoned mentors who contributed over 180 hours of one-on-one guidance, fostering an energizing environment. The culmination of the boot camp was a live pitch contest, where ten participants competed for funding, with audience votes determining the top three winners. Excitingly, another boot camp is scheduled for February in Myrtle Beach. DAV emphasizes the importance of entrepreneurship in empowering veterans and their families, enhancing both their lives post-service and the strength of communities. The organization encourages those who support veterans in the workplace to apply as DAV Patriot Employers, with applications open year-round.
