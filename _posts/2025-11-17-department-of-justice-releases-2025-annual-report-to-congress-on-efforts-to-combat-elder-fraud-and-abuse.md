The Department of Justice (DOJ) has released its 2025 Annual Report to Congress detailing efforts to combat elder fraud and abuse. The report highlights over 280 enforcement actions against more than 600 defendants who attempted to steal or successfully stole over $2 billion from more than one million older Americans. The DOJ has also held nursing home operators accountable for providing substandard care to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. 

To enhance its response, the DOJ invested in capacity building for law enforcement and organized the first National Elder Abuse Multidisciplinary Team Summit, gathering nearly 400 professionals to share best practices. The report reveals that older adults lose billions annually to fraud schemes, but the DOJ has recovered or frozen millions of dollars for victims. Through the Victims of Crime Act, the DOJ supported over 4,000 victim assistance organizations, benefiting nearly 200,000 older victims.

The DOJ conducted approximately 1,200 public awareness events, reaching nearly 15 million Americans to promote prevention and intervention resources. The Department remains committed to combating elder fraud and abuse through enforcement, victim services, and public outreach, prioritizing elder justice in future efforts.
