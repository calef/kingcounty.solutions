  people experiencing poverty, the road toward stability can be long, but one thing
  is clear: being able to get around is a critical part of this journey. Without transportation
  access, utilizing Hopelink services like fresh food from our [Food Markets](https://www.hopelink.org/programs/food-program/)
  or support from an employment specialist is much harder. &nbsp;\n\n“Transportation
  is a means to opportunity and access. It is nestled in between Hopelink’s Theory
  of Change that illustrates the path towards exiting poverty,” said Staci Sahoo,
  Hopelink Director of Mobility Management. “Without transportation, people don’t
  have access to food, employment, healthcare, and much more.”&nbsp;\n\n![Transportation

  moves throughout Hopelink’s Theory of Change. It supports folks in securing their
  basic needs and as they continue to gain stability and develop skills to exit poverty.  _\n\nWhether
  it’s having a timely bus ride to a job interview, a wheelchair accessible vehicle
  to get to medical appointments, or a short walk across the transit station to access
  a connecting line – _everyone_ needs access to reliable, affordable transportation.&nbsp;\n\nAccording
  to the [2023 Washington State Transportation Mobility Report](https://wsdot.wa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-11/2023-Public-Transportation-Mobility-Report.pdf),
  there’s a need for improving access and mobility, particularly for vulnerable populations
  in historically-excluded communities. For many of our neighbors who live in these
  areas, the need is immediate. Hopelink offers a variety of transportation options
  to support greater access to mobility, with each program providing different opportunities
  to meet diverse needs. Programs include:&nbsp;\n\n![King County Metro Community

  Van**\n\nA King County Metro service operated by Hopelink, [Community Van](https://www.hopelink.org/programs/mobility-management/community-van/)
  provides shared rides through volunteers, either one-time or recurring – to anywhere
  up to two hours driving distance away, and are available throughout the day, evenings,
  and on weekends.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n#### **Dial-A-Ride Transit (DART)**\n\nA King County
  Metro service operated by Hopelink, [DART](https://www.hopelink.org/programs/transportation/dart/)
  offers bus routes in some neighborhoods using minibuses that can go off regular
  routes to pick up and drop off passengers. DART operates on a fixed schedule but
  offers more flexibility than regular Metro buses.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n![Dial-A-Ride Transit

  mobility barriers for older adults and people with disabilities across Piece, King,
  and Snohomish Counties, Hopelink’s Mobility Management team and the King County
  Mobility Coalition&nbsp;launched the first phase of a new trip planner on findaride.org
  in March of 2024. This development was made possible by support from Washington
  State Department of Transportation, King County Metro, Sound Transit, and other
  partners.&nbsp;\n\n#### **Medicaid Transportation**\n\nHopelink brokers Non-Emergency

  Hopelink’s Transportation programs that work to remove barriers and increase mobility
  access, the agency works to support systemic change through its advocacy efforts.&nbsp;\n\nDuring
  the 2024 Washington State Legislative Session, Hopelink supported legislation that
  promotes community and transit-oriented housing development. “Transit-oriented development
  is critical as transportation provides access to jobs, education, and essential
  services,” said Susan Carter, Hopelink VP of Transportation. “It empowers individuals
  to meet their needs, pursue opportunities, and lay the foundation for long-term
  stability.”&nbsp;\n\n<script defer>\n\t\t(() => {\n\t\t\tlet article = document.querySelector('.block4150289733316089');\n\n\t\t\tarticle.querySelectorAll('a').forEach(elm
