  Americans

An Afghan citizen, 30-year-old Mohammad Ali, has been federally charged for making online threats to build a bomb and kill Americans. Ali, who is currently residing in the United States, allegedly posted messages on social media that expressed his intent to carry out violent acts against U.S. citizens. The threats were made during a time when Ali was in contact with individuals overseas, some of whom were associated with terrorist organizations. 

According to the charges, Ali's posts included detailed plans for bomb-making and specific references to targeting American interests. Federal authorities became aware of his activities through investigations into online extremist communications. Ali was arrested and is facing serious charges that could lead to significant prison time if convicted. This case highlights ongoing concerns regarding domestic threats and the potential for radicalization among individuals within the U.S. who may have connections to foreign terrorist networks. The investigation is part of a broader effort by law enforcement to address and mitigate threats posed by extremist ideologies.
