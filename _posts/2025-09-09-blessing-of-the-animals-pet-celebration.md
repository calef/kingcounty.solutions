On October 5, from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM, St. Luke’s will host a Ballard Pet Celebration at Ballard Commons Park to conclude the Season of Creation with a celebration of St. Francis. The event will feature partnerships with local pet and animal-focused nonprofits, highlighting the needs of animals in the community. Attendees can engage with local organizations, learn about animal care opportunities, and access resources from pet businesses. A free raffle with giveaways from local companies will be available for those who bring their pets. The celebration will kick off with a short pet blessing service at noon, where participants are encouraged to bring their pets, photos of beloved pets that have passed, or images of animals that cannot attend. Individual blessings will also be offered throughout the event. All are welcome to bring their furry, feathered, or scaled companions for an enjoyable afternoon.
