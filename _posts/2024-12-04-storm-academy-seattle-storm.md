Last weekend, 20 girls from Federal Way Public Schools attended a conference organized by the Seattle Storm focused on financial literacy, leadership, and building a confident mindset. During the event, Storm Guard Nika Muhl shared her insights with the students. The conference was made possible through a partnership with BECU and the Seattle Storm, aimed at empowering the next generation of leaders.
