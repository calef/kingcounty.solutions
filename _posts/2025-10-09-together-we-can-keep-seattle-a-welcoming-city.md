Refugee Women’s Alliance (ReWA) is a key member of a coalition supporting Seattle's immigrant and refugee communities, emphasizing the city’s identity as a “Welcoming City.” This coalition advocates for the dignity and opportunities of all immigrants, particularly in light of recent challenges faced by these communities. ReWA is encouraging support for proposed additional funding in the 2026 budget for the City of Seattle’s Office of Immigrant Affairs (OIRA), aimed at ensuring that essential resources reach immigrant populations. Seattle residents and affiliated organizations are urged to sign an advocacy letter to bolster this funding initiative by the deadline of October 13, 2025. The coalition comprises various organizations committed to immigrant rights, including OneAmerica, Neighborhood House, and the International Rescue Committee, among others. Community members are invited to share this message within their networks to amplify support for these vital services.
