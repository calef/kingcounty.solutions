Winter is approaching, and Bellevue's latest episode of *Lake to Lake* provides essential tips to prepare for the colder months. Residents are advised to check their homes for water pipes located in unheated areas or along exterior walls, as these are at risk of freezing, which can lead to costly repairs from burst pipes. The episode also highlights the city's new Community Court program that positively impacts lives, showcases the Bellevue Youth Theatre's 35 years of high-quality productions, explains the residential permitting expo, and details the selection and planning process for Bellevue’s transportation projects.
