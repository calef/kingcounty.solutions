By placing them in the care of a family member, cultural, family, and community ties are maintained, and the trauma of displacement can be minimized through familiarity and continuity.

  While there is no question about the benefits of Kinship Care, the sudden shift for caregivers assuming full-time parental responsibility can be overwhelming. This is where the Encompass Kinship Care program steps in.

  By providing vital support and resources, Kinship families have access to assistance with legal services, counseling, parenting classes, health care, and more. Where needed, our team helps point families in the direction of grant opportunities to help relieve financial burdens. They offer fun gatherings and outings to help provide a sense of normalcy and provide weekly and monthly support groups to share the unique joys, concerns, and experiences that come with kinship care.

  Often, Kinship providers have little to no notice that they will become full-time caregivers. Thanks to funding from the [King County Veterans, Seniors, and Human Services Levy (VSHSL)](https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/dchs/human-social-services/community-funded-initiatives/veterans-seniors-human-services-levy), the Encompass Kinship program can provide emergency funding for basic needs such as car seats, beds and bedding, rent, food, clothing, and more, relieving some of the stress families typically encounter.

In recent&nbsp;months, this has included a specialized grief camp for children, necessary therapy not covered by insurance, summer camp tuition, and even a saxophone. These ‘extras’ are a crucial step for children experiencing trauma and play a significant role in helping them find a new sense of belonging, not just at home but also in their school and community environments.

  The sudden transition to Kinship Care can be overwhelming for everyone involved. Encompass is here to help children and families feel supported, connected, and well-equipped to thrive.

  The Encompass Kinship Care program provides weekly virtual and monthly in-person support groups. To learn more, visit [https://encompassnw.org/program/family-enrichment/kinship/](https://encompassnw.org/program/family-enrichment/kinship/).
