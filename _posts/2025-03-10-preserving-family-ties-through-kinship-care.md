The Encompass Kinship Care program offers essential support and resources for kinship families, where children are placed in the care of a family member due to their parents' inability or unwillingness to care for them. This program helps maintain cultural, family, and community ties for the children, minimizing the trauma of displacement. The sudden change to full-time caregiving can be overwhelming for kinship providers, and Encompass steps in to provide help with legal services, counseling, parenting classes, healthcare, and emergency funding for basic needs. They also offer support to help children adapt to their new circumstances, including specialized therapy and activities.
