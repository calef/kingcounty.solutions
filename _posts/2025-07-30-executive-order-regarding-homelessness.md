KCRHA is evaluating the impacts of an executive order signed by President Trump on July 24, 2025, which mandates actions concerning homelessness by the U.S. Attorney General, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The order includes provisions to prioritize federal grant programs for municipalities enforcing prohibitions on urban camping and to facilitate the civil commitment of individuals with behavioral health issues who pose a danger to others. HHS and HUD are tasked with enhancing accountability in homelessness assistance programs and may end support for "housing first" policies that do not promote treatment and recovery. The order also allows for the review of compliance with federal homelessness assistance programs and the potential freezing of funds for non-compliance. KCRHA is collaborating with internal and external partners reliant on HUD programs, such as the Emergency Solutions Grant and the Community Development Block Grant, to strategize around these changes. The full implications of the order will be clearer following the release of HUD's Fiscal Year 2025 Continuum of Care Notice of Funding Opportunity. Advancing regionalism is deemed crucial to effectively address the challenges facing the homelessness system.
