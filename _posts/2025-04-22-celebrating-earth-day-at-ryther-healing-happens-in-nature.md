At Ryther, Earth Day serves as a reminder of nature's vital role in children's healing processes. Located in Seattle, Ryther's 9-acre campus is designed to support youth through various therapeutic activities. The campus features nature trails, a challenge course, a rock climbing wall, therapeutic gardens, and outdoor sensory stations, all contributing to the overall healing journey alongside traditional therapy sessions. Research indicates that spending time in nature enhances cognition, reduces stress, and fosters resilience in children, which Ryther witnesses daily. The campus is purposefully designed: the nature trail provides moments for reflection, the climbing wall and challenge course build confidence, therapeutic gardens promote mindfulness, and sensory stations cater to children with sensory sensitivities. Ryther believes that for children to thrive, they need more than just indoor therapy; they require nature, movement, and joy. As Earth Day 2025 approaches, Ryther invites the community to experience its campus and appreciates the support from donors and volunteers who help maintain these green spaces, ensuring children find peace and healing in nature. Happy Earth Day from Ryther!
