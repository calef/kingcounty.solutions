  <h3>ArtSci On Your Own Time</h3>
  <p><strong>Henry Art Gallery Exhibitions Closing in January:<br />
  <a href="https://henryart.org/exhibitions/christine-sun-kim">Christine Sun Kim: Ghost(ed) Notes</a><br />
  </strong>Influenced by non-verbal communication, Kim merges graphic and musical notation with American Sign Language. Her compositions uniquely address her experience as a Deaf individual in a hearing-centric society and broader societal influences on whose voices hold sway.<strong><br />

  This presentation is the second rotation in a two-part series showcasing new additions to the Henry’s permanent collection. Artists featured in this presentation highlight both locally and globally recognized figures, including Sarah Cain, Fiona Connor, Demian DineYahzi’, Mary Ann Peters, and Carrie Yamaoka, among others.</p>
  <p><strong><a href="https://henryart.org/exhibitions/spirit-house">Spirit House</a><br />
  </strong>Spirit House investigates how contemporary artists of Asian descent challenge the boundary between life and death through art. A thematic exploration of the work of thirty-four Asian American and Asian diasporic artists, Spirit House asks the question, what does it mean to speak to ghosts, inhabit haunted spaces, be reincarnated, or enter different dimensions? Inspired by spirit houses, small devotional structures found throughout Thailand that provide shelter for the supernatural, this exhibition considers how art can bridge the gap between this world and the next.</p>
  <p><em>Admission to the Henry is free to all visitors.</em></p>

  bridge the gap between this world and the next.\n\n_Admission to the Henry is free
