The City of Bellevue is seeking applications from organizations to provide culturally and linguistically-specific opioid education, prevention, and connection services. The city will allocate up to $10,000 in 2026 for these services, with the possibility of extending the contract for four additional years. Proposals must be submitted by 2 p.m. on November 19. Interested organizations should demonstrate how they will reach non-English speaking populations, provide free opioid prevention education to youth, adults, and families, and improve connections between crisis response workers and community groups focused on opioid prevention. This initiative is part of the funds received from settlements involving companies linked to the opioid crisis. Oversight of the fund usage is managed by King County’s Opioid Abatement Council and a collaborative work group from the city’s Fire, Police, and Parks & Community Services departments. For further details, organizations can contact the Human Services team via email or phone.
