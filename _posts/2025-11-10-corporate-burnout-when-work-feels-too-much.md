Corporate burnout is a state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion caused by prolonged work-related stress. It manifests as emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and a sense of reduced personal achievement. Unlike regular stress, burnout symptoms persist and worsen over time, making it crucial to identify early signs to seek help.

Key contributors to corporate burnout include heavy workloads, lack of control or support, and a pervasive hustle culture that blurs the line between work and personal life. Symptoms can affect mental health, leading to issues like anxiety and depression, and also manifest physically with ailments such as chronic fatigue and sleep disturbances.

Burnout impacts personal relationships, often causing withdrawal and diminishing interest in previously enjoyed activities. Research links high workplace stress to serious health risks, including heart disease.

Preventative strategies include setting clear boundaries, communicating effectively, prioritizing tasks, and taking regular breaks. Outside of work, self-care practices like regular exercise, adequate sleep, and engaging in hobbies are vital. Professional support can provide coping skills and emotional guidance, making recovery from corporate burnout possible with time and effort.
