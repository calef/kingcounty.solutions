The 2024 US Elections saw former President Donald Trump win a second non-consecutive term, defeating Democrat Kamala Harris. The contentious race was marked by intense debate and stress, with key issues including the economy, health care, Supreme Court appointments, foreign policy, and violent crime. The gap between polling predictions and results was significant, highlighting the need for context and caution when interpreting such data. In the Washington state elections, key victories included Governor Bob Ferguson and Senator Maria Cantwell, both Democrats. Four state initiatives were voted on, with only the Natural Gas Access being approved. The impact of these results on the South Asian community, particularly immigrants, is significant, emphasizing the need for awareness of politics and policy.
