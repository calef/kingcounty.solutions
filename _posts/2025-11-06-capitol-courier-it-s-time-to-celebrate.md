Seattle voters have approved Proposal 1, renewing and expanding the Family, Education, Preschool, and Promise (FEPP) Levy, which will enhance the Seattle Preschool Program (SPP). This initiative aims to provide high-quality care to 3,000 children from low-income families over the next seven years, reflecting a strong commitment from the community to improve access to child care. The FEPP Levy represents a $1.3 billion investment in education, with over 50% allocated to early learning programs, including child care subsidies and staff retention payments. The SPP offers subsidized opportunities for low-income families, utilizing an accredited, evidence-based curriculum designed to prepare children for kindergarten while supporting child care providers with specialized coaching. The success of this proposal highlights the efforts of advocates in the community and underscores the importance of early learning. As Seattle moves forward, there are calls for continued engagement, especially with the upcoming 2026 Legislative Session, where discussions on early learning will be crucial. Community members are encouraged to join Advocacy Pods to connect with lawmakers and share their experiences in the child care sector.
