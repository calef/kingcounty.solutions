Each November, Native American Heritage Month honors the history, cultures, and contributions of Native peoples in the region and the nation. Metro reflects on its connection to Indigenous values of stewardship, respect, and community, acknowledging its operation on the ancestral lands of various tribes, including the Muckleshoot, Snoqualmie, and Duwamish. Last month, King County employees celebrated Indigenous Peoples Day with an event organized by the Native American Leadership Council and Metro’s Equity, Inclusion, and Belonging team, fostering reflection and learning centered on Indigenous voices. The month serves as a reminder that learning and building relationships with Native communities are ongoing practices. Residents are encouraged to explore local museums, cultural centers, and events to engage with Native stories and art. Resources include visiting the Daybreak Star Indian Cultural Center in Discovery Park and Snoqualmie Falls, which holds cultural significance for the Snoqualmie Tribe. Seattle Magazine also offers a compilation of sites to learn about Washington's Native history. By engaging with these communities, individuals can honor Native peoples' sovereignty and strength, aligning with Metro's commitment to a racially just and inclusive region.
