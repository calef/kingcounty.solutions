On September 24th, a grand opening ceremony for Nichols Court, a new six-story affordable housing building in Seattle's Othello neighborhood, was held. The building features 148 units and is located on the site of the former Othello Tiny House Village. The celebration included performances by musician Laura Love and a blessing from Rev. Lawrence Willis, who praised Melinda and Clifford Nichols for their commitment to affordable housing and community service. LIHI Executive Director Sharon Lee highlighted the Nichols' extensive contributions, including Melinda's efforts in rallying support for tiny houses and her long-standing dedication to LIHI's mission.

The Refugee Women’s Alliance (ReWA) expressed excitement about the partnership that brought an early learning center to Nichols Court, which will serve over a hundred children with a multilingual, multicultural curriculum. Seattle Office of Housing Director Maiko Winkler-Chin emphasized the importance of Nichols Court as a supportive community space for families. The event celebrated the impact of the Nichols' work and the collaborative efforts of various organizations in making affordable housing accessible. KeyBank’s Caleb Stephens acknowledged the teamwork involved in bringing the project to fruition, reinforcing the commitment to ensuring every family has a stable, affordable home.
