  <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hemp compound CBD may harm kidneys</h2>



  <p>VA researchers from James A. Haley Medical Center in Tampa, Florida, reported cannabidiol, commonly known as CBD, may negatively impact kidney function. </p>



  <p>CBD is a non-psychoactive compound found in hemp that often is used for treating various conditions, such as pain, anxiety and nausea. The research team explored the effects of CBD on living cells in a laboratory setting and found that long-term, high doses of CBD increased calcium levels in cells, triggering genetic changes and impairing their ability to make new, healthy cells, which led to cell damage and death. The researchers focused their observations on podocyte cells, specialized cells in the kidneys that filter out toxins. Problems with these cells increased with longer CBD exposure and higher doses. The research suggests that high-dose, long-term exposure to CBD may impair podocyte health and potentially affect kidney function. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40967036/" rel="noopener">View the full study from &#8220;Biochemical and Biophysical Communications.&#8221;</a></p>



  <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Magnetic brain stimulation reduces TBI-related headaches</h2>



  <p>Persistent, incapacitating headaches are common after a mild traumatic brain injury and can lead to profound problems in a Veteran&#8217;s daily life. San Diego VA researchers found 10 sessions of magnetic brain stimulation can significantly reduce these headaches and improve brain function, such as memory and attention. </p>



  <p>The research team randomly assigned 70 Veterans into a group that received the treatment and a placebo group. The treatment group received 10 sessions of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation—noninvasive stimulation of the brain using an electromagnetic field—on the left motor cortex, a region of the brain responsible for muscle coordination, speech and fine motor control. The researchers assessed the Veterans weekly during treatment and for three months after. Treatment recipients had significant reductions in both frequency of persistent headaches and duration of debilitating headaches when they did occur, and they also reported improved memory, concentration, and attention. The findings suggest this treatment could both prevent post-traumatic headaches and improve cognitive impairment. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41109991/" rel="noopener">View the full study from &#8220;Neuromodulation Technology at the Neural Interface.&#8221;</a></p>

title: 'VA Research Wrap Up: New findings on suicide prevention, CBD and headaches'
topics:
- Mental Health & Counseling
- Health Care
---

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has released a research wrap-up focusing on three key areas: suicide prevention, the use of CBD, and headache treatments. A recent study found that veterans are at increased risk for suicide, and the VA is emphasizing the importance of mental health resources. The research highlights the critical need for effective interventions and support systems to address this growing concern.

In another study, researchers explored the potential benefits of cannabidiol (CBD) for veterans experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and chronic pain. Preliminary findings suggest that CBD may provide relief, but more comprehensive studies are necessary to establish its efficacy and safety.

Additionally, the VA investigated various treatments for headaches, emphasizing the impact of chronic headaches on veterans' quality of life. The findings suggest that tailored approaches to headache management can significantly improve outcomes for affected veterans.

Overall, this wrap-up underscores the VA's commitment to advancing research in mental health, pain management, and wellness strategies for veterans, aiming to enhance the effectiveness of care provided to this population.
