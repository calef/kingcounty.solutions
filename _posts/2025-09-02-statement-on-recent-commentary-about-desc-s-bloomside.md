Recent claims regarding DESC's Bloomside site in Burien have prompted a need for clarification. Bloomside serves 95 individuals who have experienced chronic homelessness, often facing significant health challenges. DESC prioritizes tenants from Burien's homeless population and collaborates with local authorities and organizations to ensure community safety. The site has a strict zero-tolerance policy for illegal activities and tenants are required to sign a Good Neighbor Policy to maintain community standards.

Contrary to claims of "600 police responses," most records are routine logs not directly linked to incidents at Bloomside. Actual calls from staff or tenants are infrequent and primarily involve nonviolent issues like behavioral health support. DESC provides ongoing support, including daily wellness checks and connections to healthcare services, helping tenants transition to stable lives. About one-third of residents previously lived unsheltered, and many now enjoy improved health and stability.

DESC's mission focuses on providing permanent supportive housing and wraparound services tailored to individual needs, rejecting stigma and promoting community respect and safety for all.
