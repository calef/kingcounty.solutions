The 8th Annual Run for the Angels 5K will take place on September 27, 2025, at Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport in Broomfield, Colorado, starting at 8:30 a.m. This family-friendly event supports Angel Flight West (AFW), a nonprofit organization that provides free flights for individuals needing medical appointments. Since its inception in 2017, the event has grown significantly, raising funds that have enabled AFW to coordinate nearly 100 flights for patients, up from 20 in its first year. The 5K includes races for both adults and children, as well as a fun run for younger participants. A virtual option is available for those unable to attend in person. The event is organized by HDR, with team members expressing a deep commitment to AFW's mission. Stories from passengers, like six-year-old Nicole who relies on AFW for leukemia treatment, highlight the impact of the organization. Participants can still register online for the event, with sponsorship support from various companies. Angel Flight West has provided over 100,000 flights in 40 years, addressing transportation barriers to healthcare and offering support for various humanitarian causes.
