  <p>As a volunteer-driven, nonprofit organization, Angel Flight West&#8217;s volunteer pilots and airline partners fly people to their medical appointments at no cost to the passenger.  &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br>Presented by AFW’s partner HDR, the annual fundraiser includes a 5K for kids and adults and a fun run for the organization’s youngest supporters. “HDR’s commitment to organizing, hosting and supporting this event year after year has made a tremendous impact on our charitable aviation organization,” says AFW Director of Development Mary Hunter. “We’re thrilled to witness the event’s remarkable growth, from raising enough funds to coordinate 20 flights in 2017 to enabling nearly 100 life-changing flights for patients today.”&nbsp;</p>

  <p>In addition to raising important funds, the event helps spread awareness of our mission throughout the state of Colorado. People of all abilities are encouraged to attend the event. A virtual 5K option is also available for those who don’t live locally or can’t attend the day-of 5K.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>HDR’s team members Marty Droze and Hannah Rockwell have been organizing the annual 5K for years. When asked about his desire to be involved, Droze says, “After serving as race director for the past three years, I’ve grown close with Angel Flight West staff and have met several angels (volunteers) and passengers. When hearing family members talk about their flight experiences, I feel a renewed energy and purpose to do better for the event. It’s impossible not to be touched by their stories.”&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br>Last year, AFW’s six-year-old passenger Nicole and her family attended the Run for the Angels 5K to represent AFW’s passengers. Nicole has been flying with AFW and Command Pilot Kosta Constantine for four years to access leukemia treatment and follow-up care at Children’s Hospital Colorado. Nicole’s mom Mirna says, “We’re glad to be able to participate. I’m so thankful for Angel Flight West and everything they have done for us.”</p>

  <p><strong>About Angel Flight West</strong></p>



  <p>Transportation challenges create one of the most daunting barriers to healthcare—a barrier second only to the cost. As a volunteer-driven, nonprofit organization, Angel Flight West&#8217;s volunteer pilots fly people to their medical appointments at no cost to the passenger.  </p>



  <p>Angel Flight West has spent four decades—and provided more than 100,000 flights—creating pathways to healthcare across the Western United States, arranging donated flights to people in need and providing them safe passage to and from medical care. On the ground, Earth Angels drive passengers from the airport to the medical facility, also free of cost.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Though we’re best known for linking passengers to valuable medical resources, we also provide transportation for other humanitarian purposes, such as individuals and families escaping domestic violence, disaster relief, therapeutic programs for veterans, and children’s specialty camps.&nbsp;</p>

The 8th Annual Run for the Angels 5K will take place on September 27, 2025, at Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport in Broomfield, Colorado, starting at 8:30 a.m. This family-friendly event supports Angel Flight West (AFW), a nonprofit organization that provides free flights for individuals needing medical appointments. Since its inception in 2017, the event has grown significantly, raising funds that have enabled AFW to coordinate nearly 100 flights for patients, up from 20 in its first year. The 5K includes races for both adults and children, as well as a fun run for younger participants. A virtual option is available for those unable to attend in person. The event is organized by HDR, with team members expressing a deep commitment to AFW's mission. Stories from passengers, like six-year-old Nicole who relies on AFW for leukemia treatment, highlight the impact of the organization. Participants can still register online for the event, with sponsorship support from various companies. Angel Flight West has provided over 100,000 flights in 40 years, addressing transportation barriers to healthcare and offering support for various humanitarian causes.
