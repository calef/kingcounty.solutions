  <p>50 Years! Can you believe it? Sno-Valley Senior Center is 50 years old this month!</p>
  <p>Included in this newsletter is information about our history, the building (100 this year), and the Sno-Valley Senior Center. Interested in learning more? Join us at our Anniversary Celebration and Open House on Monday, September 29,<br />
  from 4:00-6:00pm. At that event we’ll have historical displays of the building and center, presentations from former board members and staff, refreshments, and more!</p>
  <p>In addition to our open house, we’re hosting a 1970s Dance Party on Friday,<br />
  September 12 from 7:00-8:30pm! This building has a long history and in 1974 it became a dance hall named Goliath’s Pit, for the 34-foot-tall pipe organ, Goliath. We won’t have a pipe organ at our party, but we’ll have a live band, dance lessons from 6:30-7:00pm, and door prizes. Just $15 per person, $25 per twosome. Learn more about both of these on the homepage of our website, <a href="http://www.snovalleysenior.org">www.snovalleysenior.org</a>.</p>
  <p>Not only are we celebrating our anniversaries this month, September is also National Senior Center Month. The theme this year is <i>Powering Possibilities: Flip the Script; </i>inviting us to challenge outdated perceptions of aging and senior centers. We’re invited to celebrate the dynamic role that centers play in fostering<br />
  creativity, connection, purpose, and resilience in later life.</p>
  <p>We are able to challenge the perceptions of aging and senior centers just by getting someone to walk through our doors. The variety of programs, events, classes, trips, and resources we provide show that no matter your age, everyone can have a great time here. Word of mouth is the best way someone finds the center, so this Senior Center Month I encourage you to invite a friend!</p>
