Sno-Valley Senior Center is celebrating its 50th anniversary this month, along with the building's centennial. An Anniversary Celebration and Open House is scheduled for September 29, featuring historical displays, presentations from former board members and staff, and refreshments. Additionally, a 1970s Dance Party will take place on September 12, showcasing the building's history as Goliath’s Pit, a dance hall with a famous pipe organ. The event will include a live band, dance lessons, and door prizes, with tickets priced at $15 per person or $25 for two.

September is also National Senior Center Month, themed "Powering Possibilities: Flip the Script," encouraging a reevaluation of aging perceptions. The center aims to demonstrate its role in fostering creativity and connection for all ages, inviting community members to visit and share their experiences.

Moreover, the Timeless Treasures Gala & Auction will occur on October 11, featuring dinner and auction items. Early Bird tickets are available until September 12, and donations for the auction are welcome. For inquiries, contact the Executive Director, Kira Avery.
