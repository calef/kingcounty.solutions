Seattle Parks and Recreation is seeking proposals from seasonal concessionaires to operate in various parks across the city during the 2024 season. This initiative aims to enhance visitor experiences by providing food and beverage options, as well as recreational services. Interested businesses are invited to submit their proposals by Jan. 15, 2024. The selected concessionaires will be expected to comply with all park rules and regulations, and they must demonstrate a commitment to sustainability and community engagement. The department encourages diverse and innovative offerings that cater to a wide range of park users. This opportunity is part of Seattle Parks and Recreation's efforts to support local businesses and improve park amenities.
