Councilmember Bob Kettle, chair of the Public Safety Committee, announced key public safety priorities included in Seattle's 2026 budget, which has been adopted by the City Council. Kettle emphasized his commitment to enhancing public safety and engaging with constituents. Notable budget allocations include $700,000 for a homelessness initiative in Pioneer Square, $500,000 for sexual assault survivor services to maintain continuity while awaiting federal funds, and $200,000 for upgrades to the Community Assisted Response & Engagement (CARE) systems. Additional funding is earmarked for public safety provisions, neighborhood engagement efforts, and the design of critical freight routes to connect the Port of Seattle with major corridors. The budget also includes $800,000 for maintenance and upgrades at South Lake Union Park and $450,000 for community outreach related to the development of Portal Park in Belltown. Kettle acknowledged the challenges ahead for the 2027 budget, particularly in light of a projected deficit and uncertainty at the federal level, and called for collaboration among council members and the new mayoral administration to ensure the city's financial success.
