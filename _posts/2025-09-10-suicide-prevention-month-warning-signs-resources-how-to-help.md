September is recognized as Suicide Prevention Month, emphasizing the importance of mental health and strong communities. Suicide is the 11th leading cause of death in the U.S., with certain demographics being more at risk. Warning signs of suicidal thoughts include expressions of hopelessness, increased physical symptoms of distress, withdrawal from social connections, mood swings, and reckless behavior. Strategies for assistance include reaching out for help, encouraging open conversations about mental health, and connecting with professional support. Various resources are available, including the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, the Jed Foundation, and more. Immediate help can be sought through 911 or local emergency departments.
