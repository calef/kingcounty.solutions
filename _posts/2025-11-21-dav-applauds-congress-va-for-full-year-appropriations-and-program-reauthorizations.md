On November 12, Congress passed legislation to temporarily reopen the federal government, which includes full funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for fiscal year 2026, preventing any further funding lapses or furloughs. This action provides immediate relief to veterans, their families, caregivers, and survivors affected by the recent government shutdown. The legislation also reauthorizes critical programs that had expired in September, addressing issues such as homelessness among veterans, suicide prevention, and long-term nursing home care for severely disabled individuals. DAV National Commander Coleman Nee expressed appreciation for the collaboration between Congress and the VA in securing these vital appropriations and program reauthorizations, emphasizing their importance in fulfilling the promise made to America’s veterans.
