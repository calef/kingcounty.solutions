  On November 12, Congress passed and the President signed legislation to temporarily reopen the federal government through next January, ending a 43-day shutdown. Crucially, this measure includes full funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), effectively insulating the VA from any further funding lapses or furloughs in FY 2026.

  The enactment of this legislation brings immediate and necessary relief to the veterans, families, caregivers and survivors who have been negatively impacted over the last several weeks. A properly funded VA is essential to providing them with the services and benefits they have earned.

  Beyond securing full-year funding, this legislation reauthorizes critical programs that expired in September, including initiatives for homeless veterans, suicide prevention and long-term nursing home care for the severely disabled.

  DAV applauds Congress and VA for working together to pass VA’s full year appropriation that will help keep the promise to America’s veterans.

On November 12, Congress passed legislation to temporarily reopen the federal government, which includes full funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for fiscal year 2026, preventing any further funding lapses or furloughs. This action provides immediate relief to veterans, their families, caregivers, and survivors affected by the recent government shutdown. The legislation also reauthorizes critical programs that had expired in September, addressing issues such as homelessness among veterans, suicide prevention, and long-term nursing home care for severely disabled individuals. DAV National Commander Coleman Nee expressed appreciation for the collaboration between Congress and the VA in securing these vital appropriations and program reauthorizations, emphasizing their importance in fulfilling the promise made to America’s veterans.
