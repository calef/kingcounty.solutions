  ### Executive Constantine gives his final State of the County&nbsp;address

  Today King County Executive Dow Constantine delivered his [final State of the County address](https://vimeo.com/1069749528/8441a681a4?ts=0&share=copy), looking back on successes over the past 16 years, as well as challenges faced during his time in office and opportunities ahead for the next administration.

  “I am honored to have served as executive of one of the largest and most forward-thinking regions in the country. To the people of King County, thank you. Your trust, engagement and commitment to building a stronger, more just community and a better future have made progress possible,” said **Executive Constantine**. “The work ahead is as critical as ever. I know the next chapter will unfold on the solid foundation we&nbsp;built.”

  At the start of his administration in 2009, Constantine laid out a vision for King County government: to be responsive, effective and accountable to the people we serve — a county that invests in transportation, prioritizes the health and well-being of the most vulnerable and partners with cities, businesses and labor unions to create opportunity.

  Now, four terms later, he reflected on his years as executive and the ability to deliver accomplishments thanks to the dedicated public servants who show up to serve the people of King County every&nbsp;day.

  “At its heart, our work is about creating a high-functioning enterprise that delivers for the people who call this place home. We value the people we serve, and we value the public employees who devote their lives to serving the people — always staying focused on our True North in everything we do: Making Martin Luther King County a welcoming community where every person can thrive,” **Constantine added**.

  Constantine highlighted progress made throughout his administration during today’s speech at Kerry Hall on Capitol&nbsp;Hill:

  - Protected 30,000 acres of forests, farmland, river corridors and urban greenspace through the Land Conservation Initiative.
  - Completed large restoration projects along the Green, Cedar and Duwamish rivers, restoring 500 acres of fish and wildlife habitat while protecting homes, farms and roads from flooding and&nbsp;erosion.
  - Launched extraordinary measures to bring kokanee salmon back from the brink of extinction. Over 8,000 kokanee returned to their spawning grounds last season. In 2018, just 19 kokanee returned to&nbsp;spawn.
  - Taking urgent action to tackle climate change including carbon reduction through the Re+ zero-waste initiative, transitioning to electric vehicle and bus fleets, expanding high-wage green jobs and readying for climate impacts like extreme heat and wildfires.

  - Launched eight Metro RapidRide routes, with four more on the way, creating frequent, reliable service across the&nbsp;county.
  - Building a world-class rail network that is the spine of a comprehensive transit system. By next Spring, we will have grown the light rail system to 62 miles of track and 51 stations. And last year, we celebrated the opening of EastLink and extended light rail into Snohomish County.
