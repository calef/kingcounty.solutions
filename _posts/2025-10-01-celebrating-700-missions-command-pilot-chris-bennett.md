Chris Bennett, a command pilot with Angel Flight West since February 6, 2014, has reached an impressive milestone of 705 missions. He completed his first flight just days after his orientation and primarily operates a Diamond Star 40 from San Jose (SJC). A significant connection has developed between Chris and a frequent passenger, Eileen, who has flown with him 323 times and affectionately refers to herself as the president of the "Chris Bennett Fan Club." During the celebration of his 700th mission, Eileen expressed gratitude for Chris's profound impact on the lives of many, stating he serves as a vital link between home and essential medical care for numerous patients requiring specialized treatment. She highlighted his dedication, noting the time, resources, and compassion he has devoted to helping those in need. Eileen emphasized the strong bond Chris has formed with his passengers, illustrating the transformative power of volunteerism and the significant difference one individual can make in the lives of others. Angel Flight West and the community extend heartfelt thanks to Chris for his remarkable service and commitment.
