  <p><em>You have been the link between home and medical care for hundreds of people. The passengers you fly are all patients in need of the advantages offered by a large medical facility with a multitude of medical specialists. </em></p>



  <p><em>What sets you apart is that you have been flying as an AFW pilot long enough to have accumulated over 700 missions.
