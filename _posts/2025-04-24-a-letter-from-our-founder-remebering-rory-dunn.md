A pivotal moment for Dr. Theresa Cheng came upon reading an article about Rory Dunn's survival and his mother, Cynthia Lefever's, advocacy. Cheng felt a strong emotional connection as a mother and recognized an opportunity to serve veterans through her dental practice. Inspired by Rory's story, she began providing free dental care to the families of injured veterans, realizing that many veterans lacked access to dental services through the VA.

As she learned more about the struggles veterans face—ranging from emotional challenges to societal reintegration—Cheng understood the importance of community support. Meeting Rory and Cynthia personally deepened her appreciation for their resilience. Rory, who passed away on March 18, left a significant impact, inspiring the creation of Everyone for Veterans, which has helped countless veterans and their families. Cheng reflects on Rory's lasting legacy, emphasizing that even those who are not veterans can contribute meaningfully to their well-being. Rory’s story continues to resonate, reminding us of the profound difference community support can make in the lives of veterans.
