  The Valley Regional Fire Authority (VRFA) proudly announces the retirement of Deputy Fire Marshal Matt Harrington, who has dedicated over two decades of exemplary service to our community since joining the legacy Auburn Fire Department on January 3, 2000. Throughout his career, Harrington has made a memorable impact on the VRFA and the lives of countless community members.

  Before joining the VRFA, Harrington was a North Kitsap Fire & Rescue resident firefighter. He also had a distinguished military career in the U.S. Navy as a Submariner and Deep Sea Diver from 1989 to 1994, followed by service in the Navy Reserves until 2006. His military experience and his previous role as a bartender laid the foundation for a career characterized by skill, compassion, and dedication to the fire service.

  Harrington’s commitment to excellence was demonstrated through his service on the VRFA’s Technical Rescue Team, where he was responsible for SCUBA maintenance, and as a Washington Task Force 1 team member, participating in rescue operations during natural disasters such as Hurricane Irma in Georgia and a deployment to Hawaii. His contributions did not go unnoticed, earning him the Local 1352 Union Member of the Year and the prestigious Mack Award in 2023.

  In reflecting on his time with the VRFA, Fire Chief Brad Thompson noted, “Matt is one of those firefighters that everyone wants to work with, including me. I appreciate everything Matt has done and accomplished for his co-workers, the VRFA, our community, and myself. We will all miss Matt’s camaraderie and team building and wish him the very best in his next adventure.”

  Fire Marshal Andrew Bergford also shared, “Matt has been an invaluable member of the Fire Marshal’s Office, bringing an exceptional work ethic and a relentless ‘nose to the grindstone’ approach every day. His commitment to creating an inclusive and supportive environment has made an impact on our team and the culture at Station 35. I’m incredibly grateful that Matt chose to spend the final years of his career with us in the Fire Marshal’s Office; he has truly made this place better.”

  Reflecting on his career, Harrington shared, “Knowing that what I did made a difference in people’s lives has been the most rewarding aspect of my job.” Among cherished memories, Harrington fondly recalls celebrating the end of probation with fellow recruits Lando Alvarado and Melina Kuzaro in Mexico, emphasizing the camaraderie and connections that have defined his time with the VRFA. As he steps into retirement, he expresses deep gratitude for the incredible people he has worked with, stating, “I will miss all the great people I got to work with and the community we serve.”

  In retirement, Harrington plans to spend more time with family and friends, travel, tackle his “honey-do” list, and continue contributing to the community through his part-time job at Virginia Mason.

  The Valley Regional Fire Authority extends its heartfelt gratitude to Deputy Fire Marshal Matt Harrington for his years of dedicated service. We will miss his professionalism and commitment to the communities we serve.
