Able Groupe Inc., operating the website LittleBundle.com, pleaded guilty to two felony charges related to the smuggling of European infant formula and violations of FDA Prior Notice Requirements. The company sold European infant formula to consumers in the U.S. since spring 2019, with several products flagged by the FDA due to non-compliance with nutrient and labeling standards. In its plea, Able Groupe admitted to attempting to evade detection by failing to provide necessary prior notice and using false descriptions for the imported products. Following an FDA inspection, the company halted operations and recalled 76,000 units of formula in August 2021. The guilty plea includes charges for importing food without prior notice with intent to defraud and for submitting fraudulent documents to customs. This case marks the first felony conviction for failing to provide FDA prior notices. The plea agreement proposes a forfeiture of $304,640, resulting in an estimated total recovery of $2.3 million for the government. U.S. authorities emphasize the importance of FDA regulations to protect consumer safety, particularly for vulnerable populations like infants. The investigation was led by the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations and is being prosecuted by the Justice Department.
