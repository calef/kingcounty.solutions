  <p>Both dedicated professionals at the University of Washington and elite athletes for many years, Alysun and Mike have been serving our community for decades.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Their commitment runs deep. Alysun and Mike have consistently coordinated and led volunteer cooks and delivered their delicious meals, prepared specifically for each of several households at Compass Broadview, for 5 years! Every Thursday! 52 weeks per year! No missed meals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p>In the spirit of the season, holidays bring special gift cards, delivered to each of the households by Alysun and Mike.

  <p>That’s right, for several households at Compass Broadview, dinnertime on Thursdays brings a special gift from a neighbor, a volunteer cook that has been inspired by Alysun and Mike to prepare their evening meal. Cooks of all ages, from different parts of our community, participate.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>They say food is a love language. Alysun, Mike, and each and every member of the “meals team” over the 5 years are showing their love to our neighbors in the Compass Broadview community. Love expressed quietly and humbly without fanfare: A meal for individuals and families to relax and enjoy, sustenance for their body and soul. It’s a gift of freshly prepared food to nourish themselves and the time to reflect upon the day’s gifts and challenges. </p>



  <p>Sure, behind the scenes, there’s a spreadsheet and emails and figuring out cultural nuances, dietary preferences, likes and dislikes, and delivery logistics. There are shout-outs for meals to cover someone’s vacation this week or for a “new” household moving in the next. It’s an inspiring community that looks out for each other in their shared desire to serve their neighbors at Compass Broadview, all led with so much grace, love, gratitude, and respect, and illuminated by Alysun and Mike. </p>



  <p>Every dinner, every Thursday, includes required ingredients &#8211; lots of neighborly love and caring. What a beautiful gift that happens quietly and joyfully every week of the year in our Broadview neighborhood.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Alysun, Mike, and each person who has participated in the “Broadview meals team” – you are seen and appreciated. You feed our souls!  </p>
