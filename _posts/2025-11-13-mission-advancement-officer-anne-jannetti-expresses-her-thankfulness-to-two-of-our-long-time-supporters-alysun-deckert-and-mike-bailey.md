Mission Advancement Officer Anne Jannetti expresses gratitude for Alysun Deckert and Mike Bailey, long-time supporters who have dedicated themselves to providing meals for families at Compass Broadview. For five years, they have coordinated volunteers to deliver lovingly prepared meals every Thursday, without missing a week. Their commitment extends beyond just food; during the holidays, they also distribute special gift cards to the households they serve. Alysun and Mike, both professionals at the University of Washington and former elite athletes, inspire a community of cooks of all ages to participate in this initiative, fostering a sense of belonging and care among neighbors. The meals serve as a nourishing gift, allowing families to enjoy quality time together while reflecting on daily challenges and blessings. Behind this effort is meticulous planning to accommodate dietary preferences and logistics, demonstrating a strong community spirit. Jannetti highlights the quiet yet impactful love expressed through these meals, emphasizing the appreciation for Alysun, Mike, and all volunteers involved. The article invites others to join this effort or create their own meals team to support Compass Housing Alliance programs.
