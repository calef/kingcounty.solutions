Vashon Youth and Family Services, in collaboration with The DOVE Project, presents Parent and Caregiver Yoga led by Nyn Grey. This class focuses on mindful movement and provides tools for co-regulation, allowing children aged 5 and under to play nearby while parents engage in yoga practice. Recognizing the challenges busy parents face in prioritizing self-care, Nyn offers a gentle slow flow yoga session that emphasizes the importance of integrating self-care into daily life. The environment is designed to be fun and welcoming, with no previous yoga experience required. Nyn, a DOVE Project Community Engagement Advocate, is also a mother, certified yoga instructor, and Ayurvedic Wellness Coach. Participants are encouraged to come and enjoy the benefits of stretching and mindfulness in a supportive setting.
