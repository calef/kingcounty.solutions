  and triumph over injustice'

Jay Thomas has been with the Inatai Foundation for five years, serving as a Senior Program Officer after a diverse 25-year career in community organizations. His favorite place in Washington is the coastal region of Grays Harbor County, where he enjoys the balance of nature and activities. Thomas values joy, particularly as it is celebrated in diverse communities, which he believes possess powerful stories of endurance and triumph over injustice. He highlights the importance of cultural preservation in these communities, which contribute to their strength and vibrancy. Over the years, Thomas has learned that grantmaking is more complex than he initially thought, emphasizing the need to listen to and prioritize the voices of the community. He considers Washington his home, appreciating its beauty and cultural richness, and finds the Cascade Range from the Columbia River Gorge to offer the best view in the state.
