  [Jay Thomas](https://inatai.org/team/jay-thomas/) joined Inatai Foundation five years ago as a Program Officer with a robust 25-year career in community organizations where he’s held nearly every position imaginable under the nonprofit sun, from receptionist to executive director. Today, he’s a Senior Program Officer with a keen eye for advocacy and grantmaking strategies to serve the people. We asked him five questions for his five-year anniversary at Inatai.

  **1. Where is your favorite place in Washington?**

  My favorite place in Washington is the coastal region, including the Northern Beach area in Grays Harbor County, which is the same county as Pacific Beach and Ocean Shores. It has an attractive balance of peaceful nature and fun activities to enjoy. I’ve always loved being near and in the water. I have a lot of fond memories of vacations and getaways to Ocean Shores as a child and have taken my family there many times over the years.

  **2. Which Inatai value resonates with you the most?**

  Joy. Celebrating it in diverse communities across the state is one of the things I’ve enjoyed most about being here at Inatai. Black, Indigenous, people of color, and immigrant communities all have such powerful stories of endurance and triumph over injustice. Joy expressed through cultural preservation and celebration of the fullness and beauty of these communities is at the core of what has made—and continues to make—them strong, vibrant, and thriving.

  **3. What is an important lesson you learned over the last five years?**

  Prior to joining Inatai, my perspective on grantmaking was shaped largely by my experience as a fundraiser. The role of a funder was to review applications, select the best ones, and write the checks. They were the answer to the community’s problems. I’ve learned that grantmaking is more complex than I thought it would be, and how important it is to listen to our people and keep them at the center of all we do.

Thomas values joy, particularly as it is celebrated in diverse communities, which he believes possess powerful stories of endurance and triumph over injustice. He highlights the importance of cultural preservation in these communities, which contribute to their strength and vibrancy. Over the years, Thomas has learned that grantmaking is more complex than he initially thought, emphasizing the need to listen to and prioritize the voices of the community.
