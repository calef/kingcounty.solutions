Staff and visitors at Valley Medical Center participated in an educational outreach event in December, featuring a 20-foot inflatable colon designed to promote awareness of colorectal health. In collaboration with Colon Cancer Stars, the immersive experience aimed to provide information on the importance of colon health and encourage discussions about screening options with healthcare professionals from Gastroenterology, Colorectal Surgery, and Medical Oncology. Dr. Joseph Roberts emphasized the event's goal of alleviating fears associated with colonoscopies by highlighting the advantages of early detection and polyp removal. The event also featured the LAUNCH program from the Lifestyle Medicine team, which focuses on safe exercise practices, alongside dietitian Natalia Zakharova sharing recipes rich in vegetables and whole grains. Colorectal cancer remains the second-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S., yet it is often preventable and treatable when detected early through screening. Current recommendations suggest that individuals at average risk should begin screening at age 45 to enhance early detection efforts.
