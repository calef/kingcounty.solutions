The 28th Annual Rise & Shine Volunteer Recognition Celebration recognized the efforts of numerous volunteers serving youth and families in the Snoqualmie Valley. In attendance were over a hundred community members, who enjoyed a breakfast catered by Carnation Café. The event honored this year's award-winning volunteers and also presented the 2025 Scholarship Awards to Apollo Andrews and Henry Ehrnman. The awards were divided into Youth, Community, Business, and Champion categories, with multiple recipients in each. The event organizers encouraged community members to recognize and appreciate the ongoing volunteer work in their vicinity. The nomination process will reopen next year.
