  All too often the volunteer efforts of engaged citizens remain unseen or forgotten. The 28th Annual Rise & Shine Volunteer Recognition Celebration was an opportunity to recognize the generosity of so many eligible volunteers who work in the service of youth and families in the Snoqualmie Valley. Over one hundred community members showed up bright and early to honor this year’s award-winning volunteers while enjoying a delicious breakfast catered by [Carnation Café](https://carnationcafe.com/). Please see below this year’s award recipients!
