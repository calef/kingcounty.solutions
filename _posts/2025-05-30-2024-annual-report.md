In 2024, the Rainier Valley Food Bank (RVFB) made significant strides, including breaking ground on a new facility after a decade of planning. Key initiatives included establishing Mobile Markets in collaboration with local organizations and launching the Tri-River Market, an online grocery ordering service catering to diverse dietary needs. The food bank distributed 1.1 million pounds of food, with 91,000 visits recorded and support provided to 16,700 individuals. The capital campaign raised $14 million for the new facility, with plans to continue fundraising into 2025.

RVFB also expanded its home delivery program, serving 950 families and completing 31,000 deliveries throughout the year. The Tri-River Market provided 390 deliveries and was positively received by users, with all respondents reporting improved food security. The organization connected 800 guests to various support services, and the Helpline provided essential financial aid for rent and utilities, although demand exceeded available resources.

The Backpack program expanded to support 850 students, while the Spark To-Go Lunch program saw a 30% increase in served lunches. RVFB's efforts highlight its commitment to addressing food insecurity and supporting community members, particularly those living below the poverty line.
