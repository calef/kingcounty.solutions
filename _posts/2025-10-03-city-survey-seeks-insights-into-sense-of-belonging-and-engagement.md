The City of Bellevue is conducting a survey to assess community members' feelings about living in the city and to evaluate whether it meets the diverse needs of its residents. The findings will help the city understand the effectiveness of its services and identify areas for improvement. The survey, available in multiple languages, is open until October 31 and includes questions from previous years to track changes over time. Bellevue has partnered with the independent research firm ReconMR to administer the survey. Additionally, a separate survey focused on the city’s brand identity and communication methods is available until October 5. Community members can reach out to Micah Philips, the city’s performance and outreach coordinator, for any questions regarding the surveys.
