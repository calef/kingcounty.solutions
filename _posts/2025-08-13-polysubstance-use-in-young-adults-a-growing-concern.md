  use is worrisome at any age, but for teens and young adults, mixing drugs with each
  other or with alcohol is especially dangerous. Your brain doesn’t finish developing
  until your mid-20s, so using drugs and alcohol in your teens and early 20s can have
  lasting effects on your physical, mental, and emotional health. If you’re a parent
  concerned that your teen or young adult may be struggling with polysubstance abuse,
  it’s important to know the symptoms of addiction, how to talk to your child, and
  when it’s time to seek professional help.</p>\n<h2>What is Polysubstance Use Disorder?</h2>\n<p><a
  href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/polysubstance-abuse\">Polysubstance
  use disorder</a> is using two or more drugs or substances at once or within a brief
  period of time. Polysubstance use isn’t limited to street drugs. Combining any drugs,
  whether illegal, prescription, or over the counter, is defined as polysubstance
  use. Mixing drugs and alcohol is also considered polysubstance use. You may also
  hear polysubstance use disorder referred to as combined drug intoxication.</p>\n<h2>Is
  Polysubstance Use on the Rise?</h2>\n<p>Polysubstance use is becoming more common
  in late adolescence and early adulthood. <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8828938/#:~:text=At%20age%2017%2C%201%20in,in%20six%20at%20age%2020.\">According
  to the National Institutes of Health</a>, one in 14 teens reported polysubstance
  use by age 17. By age 20, that number increased to one in three with an average
  of more than three substances used together. The same study shows that the increase
  in polysubstance use “between early adolescence and early adulthood and is often
  sustained over time.” This is why early intervention for polysubstance use is so
  important. Factors that have contributed to the rise in polysubstance use include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Risk-taking
  behaviors naturally increase in adolescence</li>\n<li>Experimentation and extreme
  behaviors are rewarded on social media</li>\n<li>Illegal substances are easily available
  through online sales</li>\n<li>Vaping tobacco products <a href=\"https://hhs.iowa.gov/programs/programs-and-services/tobacco-use-prevention-control/vaping-electronic-smoking/teens#:~:text=Young%20people's%20brains%20build%20synapses,other%20drugs%20such%20as%20cocaine.\">primes
  the adolescent brain for addiction</a></li>\n<li>The practice of self-medicating
  for mental health issues has become mainstream</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What Causes Polysubstance
  Use in Teens and Young Adults?</h2>\n<p>Polysubstance use doesn’t have a single
  root cause but is the result of several different factors. <a href=\"https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/polysubstance-abuse\">Research</a>
  shows that many teens who mix drugs and/or alcohol do so to cope with the stressors
  of everyday life, including pressure to perform academically, dysfunctional family
  dynamics, pressure from social media to appear to have an ideal life, pressure related
  to physical appearance, and climate-related concerns.</p>\n<p>Teens and young adults
  are also combining drugs and alcohol in an effort to self-medicate emotional distress
  and mental health issues. The American Psychiatric Association <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/2025/04-05/teen-social-emotional-support\">reports</a>
  that “the mental health of the nation’s youth has famously reached crisis levels.”
  As a result, teens and young adults are <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3466352/\">using
  alcohol and illicit substances</a> to mitigate symptoms of loneliness, isolation,
  sadness, hopelessness, and anxiety. But in fact, early polysubstance use <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6363005/\">can
  actually cause depressive symptoms</a> which in turn increase the likelihood of
  polysubstance use, creating a vicious cycle of use from which it can be hard to
  escape.</p>\n<p>Teens and young adults are increasingly exposed to polysubstance
  use through popular music, television, movies, and social media apps such as Snapchat,
  Instagram, and TikTok. <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/child-and-adolescent-psychiatry/articles/10.3389/frcha.2024.1369810/full\">Research
  reveals</a> that teens and young adults who see their peers post about drug and
  alcohol use are more likely to use drugs and alcohol themselves.</p>\n<h2>How Does
  Polysubstance Use Affect the Adolescent Brain?</h2>\n<p>Scientists believe that
  exposing the adolescent brain to alcohol and drugs can interfere with brain development.
  <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2827693/\">Research suggests</a>
  that using drugs and alcohol during the teen years negatively affects the brain
  functions that control memory, learning, and cognition as well as the way neurons
  in the brain communicate with each other. Because their ability to control their
  emotions and behavior is still developing, teens who use multiple substances are
  <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S030646032030071X#:~:text=Adolescents%20who%20use%20multiple%20substances,as%20unprotected%20sex%20or%20gambling.\">more
  likely to engage in dangerous and risky behaviors</a> including unprotected sex.
  Polysubstance use also creates long-term consequences for a teen’s physical and
  mental health, <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/human-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00298/full\">increasing
  the chances</a> that they’ll develop a substance use disorder later in life.</p>\n<h2>Signs
  of Polysubstance Addiction</h2>\n<p>It’s important for parents to be aware of the
  <a href=\"https://lakesidemilam.com/blog/polysubstance-abuse/\">signs and symptoms
  of polysubstance abuse</a>. Different substances cause different physical, psychological,
  and emotional signs, but in general, teens and young adults struggling with polysubstance
  use display the following symptoms of addiction:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Appearing intoxicated</li>\n<li>Signs
  of overdose, including trouble breathing</li>\n<li>Increased tolerance to the substances
  being used</li>\n<li>Health issues such as seizures and injuries from falling</li>\n<li>Anxiety</li>\n<li>Sudden
  changes in mood and behavior</li>\n<li>Depression</li>\n<li>Isolation from friends
  and family</li>\n<li>Inability to fulfill daily responsibilities such as work or
  school</li>\n<li>Inability to control use of illicit substances</li>\n<li>Drug-seeking
  behavior such as lying or repeatedly asking for money</li>\n<li>Changes in appearance
  such as weight loss or gain, skin discoloration or breakouts</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Polysubstance
  Use Increases the Risk of Overdose</h2>\n<p>In 2022, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/stop-overdose/caring/polysubstance-use.html\">almost
  half of deaths due to drug overdose</a> involved more than one substance.<a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6727478/\">
  Research</a> confirms that polysubstance use is “strongly associated” with overdose.
  This is partially due to unintentional polysubstance use which occurs when you take
  drugs that have been mixed with other substances without your knowledge. People
  often take street drugs that they don’t realize have been mixed with fentanyl. In
  2024, <a href=\"https://www.dea.gov/es/node/228496\">70% of overdose deaths</a>
  were related to fentanyl.</p>\n<p>Intentionally mixing different types of drugs
  such as stimulants and depressants can be especially risky. When used together,
  stimulants and depressants can amplify each other’s effects or, more dangerously,
  mask the effects of both drugs. This can create the illusion that you’re not being
  affected by the drugs, increasing your risk of overdose.</p>\n<p>If you think you
  or someone you know has taken an overdose, call 911 immediately.</p>\n<h2>Coping
  Strategies for Teens</h2>\n<p>Because teens and young adults often use drugs and
  alcohol to help them cope with the pressures and emotions they experience, learning
  new healthy ways to manage feelings and expectations can be <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11164602/\">hugely
  beneficial</a>. Healthy coping skills can replace risky behaviors and give teens
  something positive to focus on. Positive coping strategies for teens and young adults
  include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leaning on your social support network of friends and family</li>\n<li>Getting
  regular exercise</li>\n<li>Engaging in mindfulness activities including yoga, journaling,
  and meditation</li>\n<li>Expressing yourself creatively through dance, music, drawing,
  or writing</li>\n<li>Getting involved in your community by volunteering for an organization
  you believe in</li>\n<li>Participating in extracurricular activities like sports,
  arts, or clubs</li>\n<li>Eating a healthy diet and getting enough sleep</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Resources
  for Parents</h2>\n<p>Though you might swear otherwise, your children listen to you.
  So having honest conversations with your teen or young adult about the risks of
  using drugs and alcohol is of the utmost importance. If you don’t know exactly what
  to say or how to get started, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
  (SAMHSA) offers the following tips for talking to your child about polysubstance
  abuse.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Keep It Short: Several brief informal conversations are better
  than sitting down for The Talk. On the way to baseball practice, on the way home
  from school, and over dinner—these are the perfect times to have a casual chat about
  drugs and alcohol. Talking often about your values and concerns helps create trust
  with your child.</li>\n<li>Be Direct and Honest: Be clear about your feelings on
  the use of drugs and alcohol. Tell them that you care about their health and well-being.</li>\n<li>You
  Don’t Have to Know It All: You can share your experience and knowledge, but you
  don’t have to have the answer to every question. Finding answers together can strengthen
  the trust you’ve built.</li>\n<li>Expect the Conversation to Evolve: The issues
  you’ll discuss when your child is 12 are different from the ones you’ll talk about
  when they’re 17.</li>\n<li>See Something, Say Something: If you notice a change
  in your child’s hygiene, interests, friend group, school performance, or family
  relationships, speak up. These can be signs that they’re struggling with addiction.</li>\n<li>Above
  All, Listen: It’s of the utmost importance to make your child feel heard during
  your conversations. When children feel like you’re really listening, they’re more
  likely to share their concerns and feelings.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In addition to open,
  honest conversations, it’s important to model healthy behavior, set clear boundaries
  and expectations, and learn to recognize the <a href=\"https://lakesidemilam.com/blog/polysubstance-abuse/\">signs
  and symptoms of polysubstance abuse</a>.</p>\n<h2>What to Do If You Think Your Child
  Is Struggling with Polysubstance Abuse</h2>\n<p>You may notice changes in your child,

topics:
- Mental Health & Counseling
---

Polysubstance use among young adults is increasingly concerning, as it poses significant risks to health and well-being. This trend involves the simultaneous use of multiple substances, which can lead to unpredictable and dangerous interactions. Research indicates that young adults are more likely to experiment with various drugs, including alcohol, marijuana, and prescription medications, often leading to increased rates of addiction and mental health issues.

Factors contributing to this rise include peer pressure, the accessibility of different substances, and a lack of awareness about the dangers of mixing drugs. Many young adults underestimate the risks associated with polysubstance use, believing they can manage their consumption without adverse effects.

Interventions and education are crucial in addressing this issue, highlighting the need for comprehensive strategies to inform young adults about the dangers of combining substances. Treatment options should include tailored approaches that address the unique challenges posed by polysubstance use, aiming to reduce its prevalence and associated harm. Overall, raising awareness and improving access to support services are essential steps in combating this growing trend among young adults.
