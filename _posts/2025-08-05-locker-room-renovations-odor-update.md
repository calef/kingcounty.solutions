title: Locker Room Renovations & Odor Update
topics: []
---

The Federal Way Community Center is undergoing renovations to its locker room facilities, which includes the installation of epoxy flooring that began recently. The application of the primer on August 5, 2025, resulted in a strong odor, prompting South King Fire to conduct tests for hazardous materials. The tests revealed no safety concerns, although individuals sensitive to odors may experience discomfort. The Community Center is taking measures to reduce the odors and mitigate their impact on visitors. Renovation work is expected to continue for the next three weeks, during which time efforts will be made to keep the odor at a minimal level, though it may still be noticeable at times. Day camps and public classes will proceed as scheduled without interruption. For any inquiries or concerns, Leif Ellsworth, the Community Center Manager, and Autumn Gressett, the Contract Administrator, are available to assist.
