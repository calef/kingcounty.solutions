  Neighborhood Enhancement Program&nbsp;

  The council received an update on the Neighborhood Enhancement Program. Launched in 1988, this program gives residents the opportunity to recommend and select small city-funded capital improvements that typically would not qualify for support against larger or higher-priority projects.

  Funds are allocated to NEP neighborhood areas based upon the number of households in each. The program rotates through 14 neighborhood areas in the city on a seven-year cycle. In 2024, 12 projects were completed and an additional nine are slated for completion in 2025.

  Ashwood Park planning progresses

  The council discussed the master plan for Ashwood Park, originally developed in the 1990s. The park is located next to the Bellevue Library downtown.

  The community weighed in via surveys on several master plan alternatives and ultimately preferred one that features a large open lawn with amphitheater-style seating, a plaza, an off-leash dog area, playground, parking, a restroom and picnic shelter. The plan is represented as Alternative F in the [meeting materials](https://bellevue.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7318940&GUID=E82B0BB2-B5BE-442F-9052-E5C54DB14E4C). The community also preferred keeping the name Ashwood Park, with 92% of survey respondents choosing that name.&nbsp;

  The Parks & Community Services Board recommendations concurred with the community input, and the council agreed to continue the required steps to develop the park.

  Next steps include completion of environmental review prior to formal council adoption of the preferred master plan.

  Updates on Great Neighborhoods planning efforts&nbsp;

  The council also received an update on progress made on the 2024-2025 Comprehensive Plan amendments to the Crossroads and Newport neighborhood area plans. These plans – part of the city’s overarching Comprehensive Plan – are an important, community-driven tool for addressing changing needs and conditions for each of the city's 16 neighborhood areas. &nbsp;
