  Our Sister Lillian Murphy Community in San Francisco was recently honored with an Urban Land Institute (ULI) Americas Award for Excellence. This recognition reflects the pride that residents like Hazel feel living in Mercy Housing’s thoughtfully designed, welcoming communities.

  **Hazel shared why she is proud to call this community home:**

  “When I first moved in, it was just an address — 691 China Basin Street. I didn’t feel connected to the community. But over time, I realized this place was more than just a building. It was the answer to my prayers: clean, new, and beautiful.

  “I love the bamboo trees in the courtyard and the sound of children playing at the daycare center every morning. I open my door to fresh air and greenery. One of my favorite views from the building is of Sutro Tower, watching the fog roll in over the hills.

  “I’m close to groceries, downtown, and even movie theaters. My apartment has so much storage space, a full-size bathroom with safety bars, and a kitchen with mini cabinets that I adore.

  “I’m even learning to play guitar at the music school in the building. I do my best to be kind to neighbors and staff, and to show how proud I am to live here through my actions.
