The Seattle Department of Education & Early Learning (DEEL) is inviting early learning providers and entities to apply for the Seattle Preschool Program (SPP) for the 2026-2027 school year through a Request for Qualifications (RFQ). Applications must be submitted online by December 17, 2025, at 11:59 p.m. PST. This RFQ is specifically for new SPP classrooms within school or center-based programs that are not currently contracted with SPP. Existing SPP contractors are advised to refer to information provided via email and should not apply. Family Child Care (FCC) programs interested in participating must contact SPP’s FCC Hub administrators for guidance instead of using this application. The SPP aims to provide accessible, high-quality preschool services for children aged 3 to 4 years to enhance their readiness for school and academic success, funded by the Families, Education, Preschool and Promise Levy. Additional information and application materials are available on DEEL’s website, with in-language assistance offered upon request. Applicants should remain aware of potential changes to the funding process and timeline by regularly checking the Funding Opportunities web page.
