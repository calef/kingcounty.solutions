title: New Utilities customer portal can detect high water usage
topics: []
---

The City of Bellevue has introduced a new online Utilities Customer Service Portal, enabling residents to access their water usage data in near-real time and identify potential leaks. The portal offers improved access through a secure, user-friendly interface, allowing customers to monitor their water usage and receive alerts for unusually high consumption. Key features include interactive tools for direct messaging with customer service, online requests, and access to important forms. Additionally, households and property managers can register multiple users under the same account, and customers can view their billing and payment history as well as compare water usage across different billing periods. Utilities Director Lucy Liu emphasized that this development enhances transparency and accessibility, equipping residents with essential information and tools to manage their water use effectively. Bellevue Utilities customers can sign up or log in to the portal at MyUtility.bellevuewa.gov.
