  <p>As a military child, I moved around a lot, and as a soldier, I was stationed stateside and overseas. Living in so many places gave me more appreciation for a wide variety of cultures. I am grateful for all my military experience and for those who serve because I understand the sacrifices they make.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p><strong>WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE TO MILITARY FAMILIES ABOUT OPERATION HOMEFRONT?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



  <p>We understand your challenges, and we are grateful for your service. Almost every person at Operation Homefront has a connection to the military.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p>My family faced our own challenges while serving in the military. Throughout my career, I had to deploy or complete unaccompanied tours overseas and leave my husband and son behind. We were fortunate to have my mom and my in-laws as a support system. We weren’t alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Not all the families we serve have that support, and Operation Homefront bridges some of the gaps with programs designed to support the whole family.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p>We know it’s difficult for service members to ask for help. We at Operation Homefront lean into helping the whole family with programs designed specifically for the needs of military families.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <ul>
  <li>Back-to-School Brigade® lifts burdens with one-stop shopping and free backpacks and school supplies for busy families with strained budgets. Holiday Meals for Military® and Star-Spangled Babies® Showers bring joy at times that can lack sparkle when you’re far from family.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>



  <ul>
  <li>Our Critical Financial Assistance Program® can keep a financial hardship like a car repair from exploding into something worse like loss of a job because a veteran can’t get to work. That could spiral into deep debt or the inability to pay for food and utilities. When needs change or in emergent situations such as the federal government shutdown, we adapt quickly in response.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>



  <ul>
  <li>Our various housing programs give families space to find their path forward as civilians, and many become homeowners because of those programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>



  <p><strong>WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE TO SUPPORTERS OF MILITARY FAMILIES AND OPERATION HOMEFRONT?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



  <p>We are grateful for your generous support of our mission to build strong, stable, and secure military and veteran families by improving their financial, emotional, and social well-being.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Because of you, we can work every day toward our vision of having every military and veteran family strong and resilient and supported through the gratitude and generosity of the American people.&nbsp;</p>

Liza, an Army veteran and former Air Force child, emphasizes the reciprocal nature of military service, reflecting on her 23 years in the Army's preventive medicine career field. She believes that serving allows her to contribute to something larger than herself while also gaining personal fulfillment. In her role at Operation Homefront, Liza assists staff with their work-life challenges, enabling them to better support military families. She acknowledges the sacrifices made by service members and the importance of community support, noting that not all families have a robust support system like she did.

Operation Homefront offers various programs to assist military families, including the Back-to-School Brigade®, which provides school supplies, and the Critical Financial Assistance Program®, which helps prevent financial crises. Their initiatives aim to address the unique challenges faced by military families, especially during times of deployment or transition to civilian life. Liza expresses gratitude for the support from the community, which helps Operation Homefront fulfill its mission of enhancing the well-being of military and veteran families.
