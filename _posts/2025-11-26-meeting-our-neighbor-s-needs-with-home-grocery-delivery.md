United Way of King County is launching its Year-End Giving Campaign, "Hope Doesn’t Quit, Neither Do We," from December 2 to the end of the year to support families facing hunger. Donations will provide groceries, hot meals, and emergency food assistance. The campaign highlights Carol Han, a Renton resident and participant in the Home Grocery Delivery Program, who relies on Social Security Disability Insurance to make ends meet. Han has faced challenges due to her disability, making grocery shopping difficult. Grateful for the Home Grocery Delivery Program, she receives fresh produce delivered from local food banks, which helps her manage her limited budget and dietary needs.

The program, a partnership with Amazon and DoorDash, has completed over 900,000 deliveries, addressing food insecurity by bringing groceries directly to those unable to access food banks. Han enjoys culturally specific produce and has integrated the delivery into her routine. As Thanksgiving approaches, she plans to cook a small turkey with ingredients from her delivery. Despite past hardships, Han expresses gratitude for the support she receives, emphasizing the importance of community resources in overcoming challenges.
