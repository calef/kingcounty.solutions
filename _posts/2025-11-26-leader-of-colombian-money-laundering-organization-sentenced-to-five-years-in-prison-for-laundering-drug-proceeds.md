A Colombian national, Michael Nunez Daza, also known as “Luky,” was sentenced to five years in prison for his role in a money laundering conspiracy related to drug trafficking. Additionally, he was ordered to forfeit $1.2 million. Nunez Daza, 49, led a transnational money laundering organization operating across Colombia, Mexico, and the United States. He facilitated bulk cash pickups of drug proceeds from Mexico, which were then deposited into U.S. bank accounts under the names of other individuals and companies before being transferred to Colombia. Within eight months in 2017 and 2018, he laundered at least $1.2 million for his co-conspirators. Previously convicted of conspiracy to distribute cocaine, Nunez Daza was deported to Colombia in 2004. He was indicted on money laundering charges in January 2023 and extradited to the U.S. in April 2025, pleading guilty on August 14, 2025. The case was part of Operation Take Back America, a DOJ initiative aimed at combating illegal immigration and dismantling cartels and transnational criminal organizations.
