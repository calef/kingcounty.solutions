A Grays Harbor County resident has been confirmed with H5N5 avian influenza, marking the first detection of this strain in humans. The individual, hospitalized with influenza symptoms, has underlying health conditions and owns a mixed flock of domestic poultry exposed to wild birds. Public health experts, including the CDC and Washington State Department of Health, assess the risk to the public as low. Investigations are ongoing to determine the source of exposure. People in contact with infected birds are advised to take precautions and consider getting a seasonal flu vaccine to reduce the risk of simultaneous infections.
