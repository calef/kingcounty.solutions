  What exactly is financial capability?&nbsp;** &nbsp;\n\n**Donna O’Connor** : We
  believe financial capability is someone’s ability to understand how to manage their
  money and navigate financial systems. Examples of that would be understanding money
  management or how to create a savings fund. Ultimately, it’s about how knowledgeable
  someone is about financial things.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n#### **So, what is the Financial
  Capabilities program and what services are offered?&nbsp;** &nbsp;\n\n**DO:** The
  Financial Capabilities team takes a broad holistic view of financial capability.
  We like to use the analogy of a three-legged stool to our approach. There are three
  components we focus on to support clients in reaching their financial goals.\n\n**1)
  Gaining knowledge through financial education classes on topics such as money management,
  savings, banking, credit building, and debt reduction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**\n\n**2)
  Building skills through financial coaching and counseling, providing an opportunity
  for clients to meet with a highly skilled, compassionate financial coach that will
  partner with them to discover their behaviors toward money and finances and create
  a plan for financial stability and security.&nbsp;&nbsp;**\n\n**And finally, 3)
  providing information about financial products and services that are safe, effective,
  and affordable for folks through mission-aligned partnerships and resource connections.&nbsp;&nbsp;**\n\nWe
  need those three things to be happening together. Our clients are incredibly capable
  so what we want to do is focus attention on building up skills and closing any knowledge
  gaps. We want clients to be able to use their newfound skills and knowledge in practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n![Financial

  offer classes, workshops, and opportunities for the community to come and learn
  about financial topics. They can range from building credit, managing money, understanding
  your relationship to money, banking during the holidays and much more! The other
  services we offer are financial counseling and coaching. This is where we look at
  the individual or sometimes, we see couples, and we establish financial behaviors
  and discover their relationship with money. From there, we can learn about the ways
  those relationships show up in the financial decisions that are being made. We go
  into each individual’s situation and talk it through to learn what’s happening to
  support them in creating a plan toward their financial goals. &nbsp;\n\n \n\n<script

  **Are there areas of financial wellness that clients want to learn about most? If
  so, what are they?&nbsp;** &nbsp;\n\n**DO:** Credit building is huge. That is one
  of the topics that is most talked about in the program. Debt is also on a lot of
  people’s minds right now. Student loan debt, in particular. But more than anything,
  we receive many clients who are overwhelmed and just want to know how to live day
  to day in an environment where it’s [so expensive to live](https://selfsufficiencystandard.org/washington/)
  and folks don’t have enough to cover basic needs. We partner with clients to help
  them navigate that, so they don’t feel alone as they struggle with affordability.&nbsp;\n\n####
  **What are the benefits of participating in the Financial Capabilities program?**
  &nbsp;\n\n**DO:** The biggest benefit to the program is having access to a financial
  coach in a safe, nonjudgemental space where they can talk openly. These are the
  types of resources folks don’t usually have access to unless they pay for them.
  When it comes to families that have low or moderate income, they usually don’t have
  a lot of options to talk to someone who truly has their best interest at heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nHere,
  they can take a break from everything else they are dealing with, and just talk
  about what’s going on. And usually, in my experience, when they talk it through,
  they feel better and less stressed. From there, we can really partner together to
  figure out where the client wants to go from here.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n![One-on-one sessions

  confidential environment. ](https://www.hopelink.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Coaching-920x1024.jpg

  do clients face when participating in the program?&nbsp;** &nbsp;\n\n**DO:** Some
  of the biggest hurdles clients have faced over the years is simply believing they
  can make the change they want to make. Many clients have been on such a long journey
  of not seeing positive outcomes. So, for us, it’s about working with them so they
  can find that hope and stick with it. It’s important for us to celebrate all the
  wins to keep building momentum.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nAnother challenge is how many different
  areas there are of financial wellness and how often the environment changes. For
  instance, credit scores are known to fluctuate every month and what’s on your credit
  report can change, so I think it’s hard for anyone to keep up with it all. What
  we try and do is unpack the situation and continue to partner with clients in a
  safe and comfortable environment. We reassure clients that we’re not here to judge
  you; we’re here to support you in creating an action plan to move toward financial
  wellness.&nbsp;\n\n#### **What are common misconceptions about the program and how
  does the team work toward deconstructing them?** &nbsp;\n\n**DO:** One misconception
  we hear about is most people think they need money or a certain type of income to
  budget their finances. You can still manage money with what you have and look toward
  longer-term goals. Another misconception is that some people think we provide direct
  financial assistance. People get confused between Financial Capabilities and [the
  Financial Assistance program](https://www.hopelink.org/programs/financial-assistance/).&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nFinally,
  most people don’t know how deep we go into behavior change. We want to understand
  clients and support them in unpacking the reasons why they do what they do with
  money. There’s a lot of shame and guilt around money so it’s critical to ensure
  clients can continue to make the positive change they want to see in their lives.&nbsp;\n\n<script

Hopelink's Financial Capabilities program helps individuals manage their money and achieve greater financial well-being. The program defines financial capability as the ability to understand and navigate financial systems. It focuses on three components: financial education, skills building through financial coaching, and providing information about safe, effective, and affordable financial products and services. The program offers classes, workshops, and one-on-one coaching sessions to help individuals understand their financial behaviors and create stability and security. The program also addresses common misconceptions about finance, such as the need for money or a certain income to budget finances. The main benefit of the program is providing access to a financial coach in a safe, nonjudgmental space.
