The City of Seattle has allocated $5.9 million in its 2025 budget for the development of two new tiny house villages in partnership with LIHI, aimed at addressing homelessness. These villages will consist of over 100 homes and provide behavioral and mental health services for chronically homeless individuals. Referrals will come from the Unified Care Team and outreach partners, targeting those living in tents, parks, and RVs to offer them more stable housing options.

One village, located in the Olympic Hills area of Lake City, will feature 44 tiny houses, each measuring 8’x12’, equipped with essential amenities like electricity, insulation, and furnishings. The site will also include case management offices, a community kitchen, hygiene facilities, and a laundry room. On-site staff will be available 24/7 to assist residents with various services, including obtaining identification and accessing healthcare and employment resources. A Community Advisory Committee will be formed to involve local residents and businesses. Sharon Lee, Executive Director of LIHI, expressed enthusiasm about quickly establishing the villages to help vulnerable individuals transition from inadequate living conditions into secure, heated tiny houses.
