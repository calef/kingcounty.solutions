Julia Sarazine, a Class of 1993 graduate, transitioned from a marketing career to nursing after a transformative bike trip across the U.S. in 1990, seeking a vocation that emphasized service and human connection. She enrolled in Shoreline Community College’s Nursing Program, where she gained a solid education and forged lasting friendships. Julia became a board-certified family nurse practitioner, earning her doctorate and working in various fields, including general medicine and palliative care. She later founded Sarazine Mindfulness, LLC, teaching mindfulness to more than 3,500 individuals, including healthcare professionals and veterans.

Reflecting on her nursing journey, Julia highlights the diverse opportunities within the field and the vital human connections formed during vulnerable times. She credits her Shoreline education for adequately preparing her for her first nursing role, feeling equipped alongside peers from four-year programs. Recently, Julia reunited with her nursing cohort, reminiscing about their shared experiences. As a testament to her commitment to nursing, she established an endowed scholarship for Shoreline students, expressing joy in giving back to the program that shaped her career and encouraging other alumni to support future generations. Julia emphasizes the importance of compassion and humor in nursing and advises students to trust their daily efforts.
