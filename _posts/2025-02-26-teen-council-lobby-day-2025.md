On February 17, Teen Council members Raena, Sloane, and Delilah, along with facilitator Kelly, participated in a lobbying event at Washington's state capital, joining hundreds of fellow Teen Council members and Planned Parenthood supporters. Their primary goal was to urge Governor Ferguson and the legislature to endorse progressive revenue legislation to avert budget cuts that could drastically affect vital services at Planned Parenthood. The teens arranged meetings with their district representatives to advocate for several key legislative measures, including: expanding birth control access (HB 1090/SB 5498); a Shield Law (SB 5632) to protect patients, providers, and supporters from out-of-state attacks on abortion and gender-affirming care; strengthening protections for patients experiencing pregnancy-related emergencies (SB 5557: EMTALA); safeguarding student rights through the SAFETY Act (SB 5180/HB 1296); and ensuring access to trauma-informed support and medical care for survivors of domestic and sexual assault (Survivor Bill of Rights: SB 5355).
