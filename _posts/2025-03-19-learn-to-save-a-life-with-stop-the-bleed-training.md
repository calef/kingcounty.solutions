Valley Medical Center's Trauma Services is offering FREE STOP THE BLEED® training to the community, focusing on preventing deaths from uncontrolled bleeding, the leading cause of preventable death in trauma. This hands-on, one-hour class teaches participants effective techniques for controlling severe bleeding through direct pressure, wound packing, and tourniquet application. These skills are vital in emergencies such as car accidents and unexpected injuries. The training is open to individuals aged 18 and older, with classes limited to 15 participants and a minimum of 8 required to proceed. Those unable to attend are encouraged to cancel at least 24 hours in advance to allow others to participate. With over 2.1 million people trained, this is an opportunity to learn life-saving skills. Upcoming sessions are scheduled for April 18, June 27, and August 29, each from 9 to 10 AM.
