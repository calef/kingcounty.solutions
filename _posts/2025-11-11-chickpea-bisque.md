This article presents a recipe for Chickpea Bisque, adapted from Laura Pyles, yielding eight servings. The main ingredients include 3 cups of soaked dried chickpeas, acorn squash, honey, olive oil, diced onions, minced garlic, ground spices (cumin, coriander, turmeric, smoked paprika, and cayenne), vegetable stock, coconut milk, and freshly ground black pepper. 

To prepare the bisque, soak the chickpeas overnight or use a quick soak method. Cook the soaked chickpeas until al dente, then set aside two-thirds for the bisque. Roast the acorn squash in the oven until tender. Sauté onions and garlic in olive oil, then add the spices and deglaze with vegetable stock. Incorporate the acorn squash, remaining stock, coconut milk, and chickpeas, bringing the mixture to a boil before simmering for 5-8 minutes. Blend until smooth and serve with fried chickpeas on top.

The accompanying fried chickpeas recipe involves cooking soaked and dried chickpeas in hot oil until golden, seasoned with salt, lime zest, and pepper. This dish is a flavorful and hearty option, perfect for any occasion.
