Michelle Galvan has joined the Inatai Foundation as an Accountant, bringing her reliable, considerate, and caring nature to the team. Originally from Yakima County, she discovered Inatai through Event Planner Gabriela “Gabby” Ramos, who highlighted the organization’s impactful work in Washington. Galvan was inspired by Inatai's mission and felt a strong desire to contribute after exploring their website.

She is particularly excited about being part of meaningful change and appreciates the support and dedication of her colleagues. Galvan identifies with the Mexican American community, emphasizing the influence of her roots and the importance of hard work and unity within her community. In the Yakima Valley, she witnesses a collective effort for change, which gives her hope for the future.

Galvan values racial justice, enjoys the scenic beauty of Washington, and has a fondness for Colchuck Lake. She recommends the wellness podcast "In Hindzsight" for its calming effects. Outside of work, she enjoys spending time with family, traveling, and engaging in outdoor activities like walking and hiking.
