The City of Normandy Park will set its annual property tax levy on November 12, 2025. The levy typically accounts for 10-12% of the total property tax bill and is the city's single largest revenue source. It funds general city operations, permitting and planning services, and police and emergency response. The City Council reviews and sets the levy each year, considering budget needs and property values. The City is also planning to improve cell service by modernizing its telecommunications regulations, allowing wireless providers to install infrastructure to overcome physical barriers to strong cell signal. The future of City Hall is also being discussed.
