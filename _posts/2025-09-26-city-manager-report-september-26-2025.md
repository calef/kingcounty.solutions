original_content: 'Normandy Park’s Annual Property Tax Levy: What It Means for You Fall is officially here, and the City is preparing for its end-of-year activities, which include setting the property tax levy for the upcoming year. This year, Normandy Park will set its annual property tax levy on Wednesday, November 12th. Since property taxes can be confusing, here’s a breakdown of what the levy is, why it matters, and how it’s decided. What Is the Levy? When you pay your property taxes, your money is split between multiple agencies, including schools, King County, the fire district, the library district, and the City of Normandy Park. The City’s levy is just one small piece of that total bill — usually about 10–12% of what you pay each year.'

The City of Normandy Park will set its annual property tax levy on November 12, 2025. The levy typically accounts for 10-12% of the total property tax bill and is the city's single largest revenue source. It funds general city operations, permitting and planning services, and police and emergency response. The City Council reviews and sets the levy each year, considering budget needs and property values. The City is also planning to improve cell service by modernizing its telecommunications regulations, allowing wireless providers to install infrastructure to overcome physical barriers to strong cell signal. The future of City Hall is also being discussed.
