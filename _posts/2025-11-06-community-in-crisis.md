The Rainier Foothills Wellness Foundation emphasizes the urgent need for food support in the community due to the ongoing government shutdown and rising food prices. Many families, including federal workers and those reliant on SNAP benefits, are facing financial strain. The Backpack Program, which provides weekend meals to students, has seen a 10% increase in the number of children receiving support as families struggle with food affordability. In response, the foundation aims to enhance the food provided through this program, leading to increased costs. Additionally, attendance at the Full Bellies community dinners has surged, with nearly 100 guests gathering each Thursday for meals and connection. To assist, the foundation invites community members to donate nonperishable food items, contribute monetarily for bulk purchases, volunteer their time for packing and meal preparation, and spread the word to encourage broader support. Every contribution, whether it be food, funds, or time, is vital in ensuring that no child or neighbor goes hungry, reinforcing the message of community solidarity during challenging times.
