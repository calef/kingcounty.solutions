Howard House Home is seeking assistance to support a family of six this summer. Volunteers are needed to provide home-cooked meals (prepared in a commercial kitchen) or restaurant-prepared meals. The family enjoys a variety of cuisines, including American, Mexican, and Chinese, and has no dietary restrictions. Preferred drop-off hours for meals are between 10:00 AM and 6:00 PM. Interested individuals can reach out to Eva, the Foster Care Supervisor, via email, or contact Meggan, the InKind and Volunteer Coordinator, by calling or texting.
