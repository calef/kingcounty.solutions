Howard House Home is seeking assistance to support a family of six this summer. Volunteers are needed to provide home-cooked meals (prepared in a commercial kitchen) or restaurant-prepared meals. The family enjoys a variety of cuisines, including American, Mexican, and Chinese, and has no dietary restrictions. Preferred drop-off hours for meals are between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. Interested individuals can reach out to Eva, the foster care supervisor, via email or contact Meggan, the in-kind and volunteer coordinator, by calling or texting.
