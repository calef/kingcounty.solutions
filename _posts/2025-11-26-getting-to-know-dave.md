Dave, a senior participant in the Senior Community Meals program, has been attending lunches since the program's early days at the Lake City Community Center. He lives with cerebral palsy, which limits his ability to speak and walk, but he has built close friendships within his community. This year has been particularly challenging for him; his mother, who is his primary caretaker, was diagnosed with cancer and is now in hospice care, leading to financial strain due to her medical expenses. Additionally, the closure of the Lake City Fred Meyer grocery store, the only one accessible to him by electric wheelchair, has further complicated his ability to obtain food. With the store's closure, Dave faces significant physical and financial barriers in accessing groceries, relying heavily on the Senior Community Meals program for his meals. His mother expressed deep gratitude for the assistance provided by the program, acknowledging the difficulty of her current situation in caring for Dave.
