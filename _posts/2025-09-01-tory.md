Tory's life has been marked by the struggles of addiction, stemming from a tumultuous childhood where he witnessed his parents' drug use and experienced significant trauma. He began drinking at the age of nine, leading to deep emotional wounds that affected his adult relationships. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated his mental health issues, pushing him back to substances and ultimately resulting in homelessness. At his lowest point, Tory found the courage to seek help at the Bread of Life Mission, where he joined the LifeChange Recovery Program. This program provided him with the healing love of God and a sense of community, allowing him to give back while rebuilding his life. Through this experience, Tory developed meaningful relationships and grew stronger in his faith. He is now on a healthier path, planning to find a job and save money, expressing gratitude for the Mission’s faith-focused support that has given him a second chance at life. With newfound hope, Tory looks forward to his future, feeling more stable and connected than ever before.
