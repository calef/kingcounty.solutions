For the second consecutive year, Compass has been selected as one of 12 nonprofit partners in the Seahawks' "Spirit of 12" initiative. The partnership kicked off with a successful Training Camp event alongside YouthCare, breaking previous sales records. Compass is seeking 60 volunteers for the upcoming Seahawks vs. Buccaneers game on October 5th, from 9 AM to 4 PM, to sell 50/50 raffle tickets to enthusiastic fans. Last year's volunteers helped raise a record-breaking $95,000 for the organization, and Compass aims to continue this momentum. Volunteers will work in small teams, engaging with fans and tracking the growing prize money in real-time. Participation does not require a prior connection to Compass, but volunteers must be at least 18 years old. Friends, family, and community or corporate groups are encouraged to join. Interested individuals can email Compass to secure their spot and will receive registration and game-day details as the event approaches. Spots are limited, so early sign-up is advised.
