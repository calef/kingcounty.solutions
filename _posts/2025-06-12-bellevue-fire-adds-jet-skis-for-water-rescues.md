  Serving a community positioned between two lakes, the Bellevue Fire Department performs water rescues almost every year, often relying on paddleboards and other basic tools in its operations.

  In a move that will speed emergency response times on the water and greatly expand firefighters’ range, the Fire Department has acquired four jet skis. The new equipment, funded by the Bacon Family Foundation and nearly 200 community donors in partnership with the Bellevue Fire Foundation, went into service on Lake Washington on Monday, June 9, and will start deployment on Lake Sammamish Monday, June 16.

  The rescue jet skis – equipped with flotation platforms and built for speed and maneuverability – allow firefighters to reach patients much further out in the water, faster and more safely.

  “These jet skis are a significant step forward for our team,” said interim Fire Chief Dave Tait. “In a region where our summer water temps can still cause hypothermia in minutes, this equipment will help us get to people in distress quicker and get them to safety or further medical treatment as efficiently as possible.”

  Known as Operation Water Rescue 425, this enhancement would not have been possible without the support of residents and the Bacon Family Foundation, an Eastside charity with a “No More Under” water safety initiative. More than $700,000 was raised to fund acquisition of the watercraft and related training. The department joins other regional agencies that have added similar watercraft to meet the growing need for faster response on busy recreational waterways.

  The Bellevue Fire Foundation continues to raise funds to maintain Operation Water Rescue 425 at [BellevueFireFoundation.org](http://www.bellevuefirefoundation.org/).

The Bellevue Fire Department has enhanced its water rescue capabilities by acquiring four jet skis, enabling quicker emergency responses on local waterways. Funded by the Bacon Family Foundation and nearly 200 community donors, the jet skis went into service on Lake Washington on June 9 and will be deployed on Lake Sammamish starting June 16. These rescue jet skis are equipped with flotation platforms and designed for speed and maneuverability, allowing firefighters to reach individuals in distress much more efficiently. Interim Fire Chief Dave Tait emphasized the importance of this equipment, particularly in a region where summer water temperatures can lead to hypothermia within minutes. This initiative, named Operation Water Rescue 425, raised more than $700,000 for the jet skis and related training. The Bellevue Fire Department joins other regional agencies that have adopted similar watercraft to improve response times in busy recreational areas. The Bellevue Fire Foundation is actively raising funds to support the ongoing maintenance of this operation, which enhances public safety and emergency services beyond the city's standard resources.
