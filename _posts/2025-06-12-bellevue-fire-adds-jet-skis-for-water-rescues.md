title: Bellevue Fire adds jet skis for water rescues
topics: []
---

The Bellevue Fire Department has enhanced its water rescue capabilities by acquiring four jet skis, enabling quicker emergency responses on local waterways. Funded by the Bacon Family Foundation and nearly 200 community donors, the jet skis went into service on Lake Washington on June 9 and will be deployed on Lake Sammamish starting June 16. These rescue jet skis are equipped with flotation platforms and designed for speed and maneuverability, allowing firefighters to reach individuals in distress much more efficiently. Interim Fire Chief Dave Tait emphasized the importance of this equipment, particularly in a region where summer water temperatures can lead to hypothermia within minutes. This initiative, named Operation Water Rescue 425, raised over $700,000 for the jet skis and related training. The Bellevue Fire Department joins other regional agencies that have adopted similar watercraft to improve response times in busy recreational areas. The Bellevue Fire Foundation is actively raising funds to support the ongoing maintenance of this operation, which enhances public safety and emergency services beyond the city's standard resources.
