  <p><em>“The story of life is quicker than the wink of an eye. The story of love is hello and goodbye until we meet again.” &#8211; Jimi Hendrix</em></p>



  <p>Jeff Small loved Jimi Hendrix. His music was a constant in his life, and it always brought some comfort in the face of the many challenges he faced. Jeff struggled with bipolar disorder, homelessness, and physical ailments that made the last 20 years of his life a constant fight. That is until he found himself walking through the doors of our Ronald Commons program in 2019.</p>



  <p>Ronald Commons is one of Compass’s housing programs, focused on formerly homeless and low-income individuals and families with children. It offers studio, 1, 2, and 3-bedroom units, with a major focus on building community. It is more than a building; it is a loving home, <a href="https://www.compasshousingalliance.org/donate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>and your continuing financial support of Compass helps make it all possible.</strong></a></p>



  <p>Jeff found something he hadn’t had in a long time: a community that cared about him and needed him. It had been years since he felt needed, not a burden but a blessing. New friends and new companions surrounded him until he passed away.</p>



  <p>Kelly, Jeff’s daughter, saw the transformation in him when he made Compass his home. She knew that Compass offered more than just housing, but she didn’t know how much love was at the center of everything we do.</p>



  <p>“When I first heard that he had passed, I had this image of him living this lonely life,” she said. “But that wasn’t the case. When I came to pick up his things and personal effects, I was overwhelmed with gratitude for this place. People cared for my dad. They loved him. He finally had dignity after struggling for so much of his life.”</p>

  <p>Corinne, program manager of Ronald Commons, and her team made space for people to mourn Jeff’s death.

They focus on humanity and dignity.</strong>&nbsp;They advocate for people, decrease suffering, and treat people with compassion. It really is incredible.”</p>



  <p>At Compass, we sometimes serve as people’s final living place. We take it seriously as a solemn duty, and we are honored to be a place where people can find peace and dignity. We surround people with love and support, and we see people for who they are—whole human beings.</p>



  <p>“I remember being so desperate, hoping people would see my dad as more than just his illness or his homelessness,” Kelly said. “Compass did. They saw him, not his challenges, but his capacity to grow and love. My dad was finally ‘living his best life,’ and that was all due to the Compass community.”</p>



  <p><strong>Please consider supporting Compass so that we can continue to provide housing, emergency services, and enhanced shelters AND something this world needs even more of right now — LOVE.</strong></p>

Jeff Small found a home at Ronald Commons, a Compass Housing program, after years of struggling with bipolar disorder, homelessness, and health issues. This community offered him more than just shelter; it provided a supportive environment where he felt needed and appreciated. After his passing, his daughter Kelly discovered the profound impact Compass had on her father's life. She was moved by the love and care shown by the staff and residents, which transformed Jeff’s experience from loneliness to one of dignity and connection. During a memorial for Jeff, the community came together to share memories and honor him, demonstrating the compassionate spirit of Compass. Program manager Corinne and her team facilitated the mourning process, highlighting the importance of community support. Residents remembered Jeff fondly, acknowledging his kindness and the way he was embraced as a valued individual, not defined by his struggles. Kelly reflected on how Compass recognized her father’s potential for growth and love, allowing him to live his best life. The article emphasizes the need for continued support for Compass to maintain its mission of providing housing, dignity, and love to those in need, especially in light of potential funding challenges.
