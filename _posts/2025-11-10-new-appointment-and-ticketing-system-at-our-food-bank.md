FamilyWorks Food Bank has introduced a new appointment and ticketing system to streamline service for clients. This system aims to reduce wait times and ensure a more organized experience for visitors. Clients can now schedule appointments online or via phone, allowing them to select a time that works for them. Each appointment will provide clients with a set number of tickets, which they can use to shop for food items. This initiative not only enhances efficiency but also helps maintain a safe environment by managing the volume of people in the food bank at any given time. FamilyWorks encourages clients to take advantage of this new system, which is designed to create a more dignified and respectful shopping experience. Appointments are available during regular food bank hours, and clients can adjust or cancel their appointments as needed. The organization remains committed to supporting the community and providing essential resources to those in need.
