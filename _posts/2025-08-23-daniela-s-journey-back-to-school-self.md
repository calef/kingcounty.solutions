---

Daniela, a Class of 2025 graduate, shares her journey from a challenging childhood to embracing her education and self-identity. Raised by a single mother who struggled to provide, Daniela found support from a caring teacher and later entered foster care after being a crime victim. Despite the upheaval, she maintained her academic performance. In 10th grade, feeling lost and influenced by peers, she realized the importance of education and self-care. With encouragement from her chosen sister, Daniela focused on her well-being and re-engaged with her studies.

Throughout her time in foster care, Treehouse provided vital support, including educational guidance and resources. Daniela opted to obtain her GED in her senior year and successfully transitioned to college, achieving a 4.0 GPA. She aspires to transfer to a four-year university to study political science and eventually attend law school, aiming to use her bilingual skills for pro bono work. Daniela hopes to travel and experience new cultures, emphasizing that one's past does not define their future. She believes it's essential to rise above adversity and maintain kindness despite life's challenges.
