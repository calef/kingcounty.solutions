  <h3>When Daniela Started School</h3>
  <p><span data-contrast="none">Daniela was born to a young single mother who had to work multiple jobs just to get by—often leaving Daniela alone at a young age. A teacher at Daniela&#8217;s elementary school who lived in the neighborhood took an active role in her life. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
  <p><span data-contrast="none">“She would give me food and sometimes she would watch me,” recalls Daniela. “She was just the best, because my mom just couldn&#8217;t—she was just so busy working all the time. </span><span data-contrast="auto">That&#8217;s how I met my sister—not my biological sister, but I met her when she was 18. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
  <p><span data-contrast="auto">“They used to take care of me. I had so much going on, and they just made it, like, so special for me. They would celebrate my birthdays and get me birthday gifts. And that&#8217;s something I didn&#8217;t always have because my mom and I didn&#8217;t have a lot of money, you know? Whenever I would go back to school, she would buy me new school supplies, new backpack, new shoes.</span><span data-contrast="none">”</span></p>
  <h3>Becoming a Student in Foster Care</h3>
  <p><span data-contrast="none">In 7th grade, Daniela was the target of a crime and was placed into foster care for three years. Through placement changes and being led through the legal process, she was able to keep her grades up. But everything became too much in 10th grade.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
  <p><span data-contrast="auto">“I kind of lost myself there for a little bit,” says Daniela. “I didn&#8217;t think I was going to graduate, and I didn&#8217;t think I was gonna go to college. I feel like I let everyone around me influence me as well. Everyone was like ‘oh, we don&#8217;t want to go to college,’ but it&#8217;s like, that&#8217;s not really an option for me. College is, like, my only saving thing here.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
  <p><span data-contrast="none">With a bad relationship over, Daniela found a moment of peace and clarity. She decided to focus on herself, prioritize exercise, and recommit to her education. Through it all, her community was there to walk that path with her.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559685&quot;:0,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
  <p><span data-contrast="auto">Daniela’s chosen sister shows her how to practice self-love and self-care—something that’s even more important now Daniela&#8217;s back with her mother and two little brothers, ages 5 and 6, who she pours love and care into. She and her sister now bond over how important being a big sister feels. But her sister reminds her you can’t pour from an empty cup. Sometimes self-care is pampering yourself, and sometimes it’s pushing yourself. </span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
  <p><span data-contrast="auto">“My sister took me skydiving,” Daniela laughs. “I told her, like, a year ago ‘Oh, for my 18th, it would be cool to go skydiving.’ But I said that as a joke, right? And then she took me skydiving. I think I had a panic attack, like, right in the air, but we just jumped out, and I was like, ‘oh okay.’ She listens; you gotta be careful.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
  <h3>How Treehouse Helps</h3>
  <p><span data-contrast="none">Since she was placed in foster care, Treehouse has also been there. Daniela enjoys shopping at the Treehouse Store; she received financial support to attend prom and even got incentive gifts for achievements. Maybe the most important was the one-on-one educational support.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
  <p><span data-contrast="none">“I got a representative in, like, my freshman year of high school. She helped me so, so much! Then I got Mr. Kevin in my senior year—we still meet regularly, maybe like once a month now. We talk over my goals and stuff, which is nice. I&#8217;m just really focused on keeping a good GPA because I want to transfer to a four-year university eventually.</span><span data-contrast="auto">”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
  <p><span data-contrast="none">When Daniela re-engaged in school, she and Kevin discussed her options. She decided to obtain her GED in the fall of her senior year of high school and enroll in college early.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559737&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
  <p><span data-contrast="auto">“I felt scared there because I kept hearing so much stigma about the GED and whatnot,” says Daniela. “But there were so many people graduating and then they were just going straight to college. It felt really nice just to get that over with and, like, be able to move on with my life. I was so proud of myself. My mom was really happy too.</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
  <p><span data-contrast="auto">“I started college in January, but they messed up my payments and then I had to drop out for the winter quarter. When I went back in April</span><span data-contrast="none">, I finished the quarter with a 4.0 GPA. I thought, ‘wow, I&#8217;m really, really smart, actually.’ That brought me back to life.”</span><span data-ccp-props="{&quot;134233117&quot;:false,&quot;134233118&quot;:false,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559738&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:240}"> </span></p>
  <h3>What&#8217;s Next</h3>
  <p><span data-contrast="none">Daniela has her sights set on transferring to a four-year university to major in political science.

  “I’ve always been really smart, but my life was just always getting in the way,” says Daniela. She is one of the [Class of 2025 graduates](https://youtu.be/5AUSVLg6Go0?si=zwdtbqryYUS9xVW7) Treehouse celebrated earlier this year; this is her story leading up to that milestone and the beginning of her journey as a young adult.&nbsp;

  ### When Daniela Started School

  Daniela was born to a young single mother who had to work multiple jobs just to get by—often leaving Daniela alone at a young age. A teacher at Daniela’s elementary school who lived in the neighborhood took an active role in her life.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  “She would give me food and sometimes she would watch me,” recalls Daniela. “She was just the best, because my mom just couldn’t—she was just so busy working all the time. That’s how I met my sister—not my biological sister, but I met her when she was 18.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  “They used to take care of me. I had so much going on, and they just made it, like, so special for me. They would celebrate my birthdays and get me birthday gifts. And that’s something I didn’t always have because my mom and I didn’t have a lot of money, you know? Whenever I would go back to school, she would buy me new school supplies, new backpack, new shoes.”

  ### Becoming a Student in Foster Care

  ### What’s Next

  Daniela has her sights set on transferring to a four-year university to major in political science. After seeing the legal system up close, she has some thoughts on how to better serve clients.

Daniela, a Class of 2025 graduate, shares her journey from a challenging childhood to embracing her education and self-identity. Raised by a single mother who struggled to provide, Daniela found support from a caring teacher and later entered foster care after being a crime victim. Despite the upheaval, she maintained her academic performance. In 10th grade, feeling lost and influenced by peers, she realized the importance of education and self-care. With encouragement from her chosen sister, Daniela focused on her well-being and re-engaged with her studies.

Throughout her time in foster care, Treehouse provided vital support, including educational guidance and resources. Daniela opted to obtain her GED in her senior year and successfully transitioned to college, achieving a 4.0 GPA. She aspires to transfer to a four-year university to study political science and eventually attend law school, aiming to use her bilingual skills for pro bono work. Daniela hopes to travel and experience new cultures, emphasizing that one's past does not define their future. She believes it's essential to rise above adversity and maintain kindness despite life's challenges.
