Willem, born in 1941 in Bogor (Dutch East Indies), was interned in Japanese concentration camps during WWII. After the war, his family underwent more tragedy, leading to a fragmented life across continents. His parents never spoke of their experiences, and the family eventually separated. Willem moved to the U.S., served in the U.S. Army, and later retired. In his retirement, he found community and purpose in the IACS seniors’ program, where he enjoys chair yoga, setting up for meals, and the familiar routine. The program offers not just activities but dignity, usefulness, and a space for memory.
