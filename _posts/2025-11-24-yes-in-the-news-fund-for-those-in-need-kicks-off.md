Youth Eastside Services (YES) is featured in The Seattle Times' Fund for Those in Need campaign, highlighting the increasing demand for services in the region. This annual holiday fundraising initiative supports various nonprofit services, including clothing, meals, and educational support, with a goal of raising $3 million this year. Nonprofits are facing funding cuts and stricter eligibility requirements for Medicaid, which could leave nearly 5 million people without coverage by 2027. YES emphasizes the importance of community-based programs like Latino H.E.A.T., which fosters empowerment and leadership among immigrant youth. Chris Roddewig-Díaz, an 18-year-old participant, shares how the group helped him navigate personal challenges while caring for his father with Parkinson's disease. The organization anticipates a growing need for services as clients face potential loss of Medicaid coverage, particularly among youth of color and undocumented individuals. Donations will assist in expanding community-based services and providing support to those dealing with new Medicaid enrollment requirements. Roddewig-Díaz, who has benefitted from the group, aims to pursue a career in psychology to help others.
