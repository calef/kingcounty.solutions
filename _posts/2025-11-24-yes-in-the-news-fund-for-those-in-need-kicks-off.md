  # Fund for Those in Need kicks off as nonprofits face year like no other

  By: Kai Uyehara, Seattle Times breaking news reporter

  [The Seattle Times Fund for Those in Need,](https://ffn.seattletimes.com/)&nbsp;an annual holiday fundraising campaign that helps buy clothing and supplies for babies, meals for older adults, education support and mentorship, among other services.

  This year, even more so than in some years past, fundraising is critical.

  Nonprofits are facing state and federal&nbsp;[funding cuts](https://apnews.com/article/trump-government-grants-nonprofits-funding-cuts-7a1229c0124f6a8476d7881b76e36c1f), while their clients face&nbsp;[new eligibility conditions for Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/mental-health/how-trumps-medicaid-work-requirements-could-affect-mental-health-care/)&nbsp;and aggressive&nbsp;[immigration enforcement](https://www.seattletimes.com/tag/immigration/).

Youth Eastside Services (YES) is featured in The Seattle Times' Fund for Those in Need campaign, highlighting the increasing demand for services in the region. This annual holiday fundraising initiative supports various nonprofit services, including clothing, meals, and educational support, with a goal of raising $3 million this year. Nonprofits are facing funding cuts and stricter eligibility requirements for Medicaid, which could leave nearly 5 million people without coverage by 2027. YES emphasizes the importance of community-based programs like Latino H.E.A.T., which fosters empowerment and leadership among immigrant youth. Chris Roddewig-Díaz, an 18-year-old participant, shares how the group helped him navigate personal challenges while caring for his father with Parkinson's disease. The organization anticipates a growing need for services as clients face potential loss of Medicaid coverage, particularly among youth of color and undocumented individuals. Donations will assist in expanding community-based services and providing support to those dealing with new Medicaid enrollment requirements. Roddewig-Díaz, who has benefitted from the group, aims to pursue a career in psychology to help others.
