On August 19, 2025, the Seattle Youth Employment Program (SYEP) held an End of Internship Celebration at the Seattle Aquarium, honoring the achievements of its interns. Mayor Bruce Harrell delivered encouraging remarks and took photos with the interns, who had spent six weeks gaining hands-on experience in various departments, local businesses, and nonprofit organizations. The event featured refreshments and the opportunity for interns to connect and reflect on their experiences. An Nguyen, a returning participant, expressed pride in his progress toward his future career, while Gabrielle Mann highlighted her contributions to food assistance programs. Ron Mirabueno, from the Human Services Department, emphasized the importance of recognizing the efforts of young people and their supervisors. Awards were presented to outstanding interns, including Abdiwali Shaie, who stressed the significance of networking. The celebration focused on gratitude and appreciation for the interns' hard work and the support they received from their site supervisors and program partners.
