original_content: "<p class=\"\">Every day, the King County Family Intake Line, operated
  by Mary’s Place, receives an average of  <strong>50-60 calls from families seeking
  a safe place to come inside</strong>. Unfortunately, across all the shelters in
  the county, there’s only space for <strong>two to three families to come inside;
  the rest must spend another night outside in their car, tent, or an encampment.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p
  class=\"\">But for the families still outside, <em>hope isn’t lost</em> thanks to
  Mary’s Place mobile outreach team and our community partners<span>.</span>&nbsp;</p><p
  class=\"\">A July 2024 panel discussion brought together Mary’s Place outreach team
  members and partner organizations to share this important work.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\"><em>“Our
  goal, at its root, is simple,”</em> shared Jessica Safley, Outreach Director at
  Mary’s Place, <em>“meet families wherever they are—geographically and emotionally—and
  walk alongside them on their journey back to stability. Our</em><span><em> </em></span><em>
  team hits the road daily, meeting families in cars, tents, and encampments</em>.
  <em>Our first step when we meet a family is always to listen and let them know we
  see them, and they are not alone. Our team is compassionate and consistent, building
  a foundation of trust with families that allows us to work closely with them to
  assess their needs and make a plan for the path forward.”</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p
  class=\"\">Referrals to the outreach team come in from community members, hospitals,
  schools, and even the families themselves through our outreach request portal or
  the King County Family Intake Line (206-245-1026). <em>“If we hear there’s a family
  in need, we go to them, meeting them where they feel comfortable, typically within
  a few hours,” </em>says Jessica.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">Our outreach team members
  arrive with food and tents, along with prepaid phones for receiving calls from prospective
  landlords or employers, diapers, hygiene kits, and a compassionate listening ear.
  From the first conversation, the focus is on identifying the family’s housing goals
  and obstacles, then working together to find a solution—that might mean paying off
  a small amount of housing debt to get a family back into an apartment, helping a
  mom and kids escaping domestic violence get to a relative in another state, or bringing
  a family into emergency shelter when possible while we work on a longer-term solution.<em>
  “Our flexible funding allows us to help families in so many ways, from a plane ticket
  to get back to family in another state, to covering the deposit and move-in costs
  to get them over the hump and into an apartment that will fit their budget long-term.
  We have the flexibility to give families the help they truly need to gain stability,
  because no two situations are exactly the same.”</em>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">Mary’s
  Place Popsicle Place Coordinator, Keianna, joined the conversation to share how
  the program provides specialized outreach services to families experiencing homelessness
  with medically fragile children.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">Too often, for families
  with children going through chemotherapy, transplant procedures, or other ongoing
  medical treatments, the weight of mounting medical bills can leave them choosing
  between providing care for their child or paying rent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">Many
  families in the Popsicle Place program have left jobs and housing behind for their
  child’s treatment. That’s where staff like Keianna step in. The Popsicle Place team
  connects directly with families at hospitals, coordinating with social workers and
  care teams to prevent families from being discharged into homelessness.&nbsp;</p><p
  class=\"\"><em>“When a child is healing, home is the best place, and we work really
  hard to prevent families from being discharged into homelessness,”</em> Keianna
  shared. <em>“But when a permanent home isn’t an option right away, we work to make
  shelter as supportive and prepared as possible.”</em>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">Keianna
  shared the story of Jane, a mom who moved to Seattle from the Tri-Cities for her
  daughter’s treatment at Seattle Children’s Hospital. When extended care forced them
  into debt and eviction, they found a temporary stay at Ronald McDonald House. From
  there, Mary’s Place connected with Jane, helped resolve her housing debt, and assisted
  the family in moving into a new home.</p><p class=\"\"><em>“The partnerships we
  have with community organizations, and with area hospitals, schools, libraries,
  community centers, and clinics, are essential to not just the success of the Popsicle
  Place program, but our Outreach team as a whole,”</em>&nbsp;added Jessica.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p
  class=\"\">One such partner organization is Vine Maple Place, which serves single-parent
  families in South Seattle. <em>“We serve over 1,400 single-parent families each
  year—both families currently homeless and those on the edge,”</em> shared Kyle Serquinia,
  Vine Maple Place’s Housing Stability Director.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">Vine
  Maple Place collaborates closely with Mary’s Place to enhance support coordination.
  The organizations share information, flexible funding, and resources, ensuring families
  get faster help and nobody falls through the cracks.&nbsp;<em>“By partnering closely,
  we’re speeding up housing placements and serving even more families efficiently
  and equitably,”</em> shared Kyle.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">People have a lot of questions
  about both the causes of homelessness and the barriers that families are facing
  in getting back into housing stability.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\"><em>“A lot of families
  in our area are extremely rent burdened,”</em> shared Jessica. <em>“When 50-70%
  of your income is going to rent, that doesn't give you any wiggle room. In King
  County and across the nation, we’re seeing the cost of rent, groceries, diapers,
  and everything else increase, while wages remain stagnant. When something goes wrong
  for an extremely rent-burdened family, like a broken-down car or an unexpected bill,
  that one event can completely blow their budget and cause a missed rent payment.”</em>&nbsp;</p><p
  class=\"\">Kyle echoed Jessica’s response and added that helping families reach
  a point where they’re earning a livable income is a key component of wraparound
  services. <em>“Some of the families we serve have been through so much trauma and
  the hope is just gone,” </em>he said,<em> “it’s our hope that through some of the
  career development services we offer, and by partnering with other organizations
  and community members, we can remind families that their goals are attainable and
  there are people and resources here to support them.”</em>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">Listening
  to families, honoring their choices, and helping them build a sustainable life—that’s
  how our outreach team not just helps families return to housing, but truly helps
  them thrive. <em>“At the end of the day, this work isn’t just about responding to
  homelessness. It’s about responding to humanity—with urgency, with mobility, and
  with love,” </em>concluded Jessica.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

Every day, the King County Family Intake Line operated by Mary’s Place receives 50-60 calls from families seeking shelter, but local shelters can accommodate only two to three families at a time. To address this critical gap, Mary’s Place has a mobile outreach team that provides support directly to families living in cars, tents, or encampments. The outreach team prioritizes building trust and understanding each family's unique needs to create personalized plans for stability. They offer essential supplies, including food, hygiene kits, and prepaid phones, while also facilitating access to temporary housing and resources for long-term solutions.

Specialized services are available for families with medically fragile children through the Popsicle Place program, which collaborates with hospitals to prevent homelessness during treatment. Partnerships with organizations like Vine Maple Place enhance support for single-parent families, streamlining resources and funding to expedite housing placements. The outreach team's efforts are essential in addressing the challenges of rent burden, where families often spend 50-70% of their income on housing. By providing wraparound services and career development, the outreach team aims to restore hope and help families achieve sustainable living.
