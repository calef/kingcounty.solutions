Every day, the King County Family Intake Line operated by Mary’s Place receives 50-60 calls from families seeking shelter, but local shelters can accommodate only two to three families at a time. To address this critical gap, Mary’s Place has a mobile outreach team that provides support directly to families living in cars, tents, or encampments. The outreach team prioritizes building trust and understanding each family's unique needs to create personalized plans for stability. They offer essential supplies, including food, hygiene kits, and prepaid phones, while also facilitating access to temporary housing and resources for long-term solutions.

Specialized services are available for families with medically fragile children through the Popsicle Place program, which collaborates with hospitals to prevent homelessness during treatment. Partnerships with organizations like Vine Maple Place enhance support for single-parent families, streamlining resources and funding to expedite housing placements. The outreach team's efforts are essential in addressing the challenges of rent burden, where families often spend 50-70% of their income on housing. By providing wraparound services and career development, the outreach team aims to restore hope and help families achieve sustainable living.
