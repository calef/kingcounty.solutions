Community members are invited to the Residential Permitting Expo hosted by the City of Bellevue on Saturday, October 25, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. at City Hall. This free, family-friendly event aims to educate attendees about the permitting process, including remodels, additions, and accessory dwelling units (ADUs). Participants can engage with city experts, ask questions, and receive practical guidance on topics such as code updates, permit reviews, and inspections.

The expo will feature a panel discussion focused on ADU construction, workshops on navigating MyBuildingPermit.com, and activities designed for children. This event caters to various interests, whether attendees are planning a new home, considering a DIY remodel, or seeking updates on housing policies. City Hall is accessible via light rail, walking, or rolling, with free visitor parking available. While registration is encouraged, it is not mandatory for participation.
