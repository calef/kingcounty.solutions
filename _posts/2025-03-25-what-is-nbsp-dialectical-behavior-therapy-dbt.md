Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is a cognitive-behavioral therapy created by Dr. Marsha Linehan in the late 1980s, originally aimed at treating borderline personality disorder and suicidal ideation. It has since been adapted for various mental health issues, including depression, anxiety, PTSD, eating disorders, and substance use disorders. DBT focuses on balancing acceptance and change, encouraging individuals to accept their current situations while striving to alter unhelpful behaviors. 

The therapy incorporates four key components: 

1. **Mindfulness**: Enhancing present-moment awareness of thoughts, feelings, and sensations without judgment, which aids in emotional regulation.
2. **Distress Tolerance**: Developing skills to endure distressing situations without resorting to harmful behaviors.
3. **Emotion Regulation**: Identifying and managing intense emotions to reduce vulnerability and cultivate positive experiences.
4. **Interpersonal Effectiveness**: Improving communication skills to assert needs and maintain healthy relationships, including setting boundaries and resolving conflicts.

DBT typically includes individual therapy, group skills training, and phone coaching, making it particularly beneficial for those struggling with intense emotional responses and difficulties in regulating emotions and behaviors.
