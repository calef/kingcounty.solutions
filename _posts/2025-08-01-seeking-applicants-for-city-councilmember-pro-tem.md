  _(Edited 8/1, 2:16 p.m. to clarify term of appointment).&nbsp;_ Per RCW 35A.12.030,
  no individual may simultaneously hold the pro tem position and any other public

  appointed to Position No. 6, then elected to a different position. Similarly, anyone
  currently serving on a City of Tukwila commission or board would need to resign
  that position prior to taking office as a city councilmember and cannot serve both
