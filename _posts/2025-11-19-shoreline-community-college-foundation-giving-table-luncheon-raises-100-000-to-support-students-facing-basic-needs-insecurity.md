On November 7, 2025, the Shoreline Community College Foundation hosted its annual Giving Table Luncheon, attracting 296 attendees and raising $100,000 to assist students facing basic needs insecurity. The funds will provide emergency aid, basic needs support, and scholarships, helping students overcome financial barriers related to food, housing, transportation, and healthcare. Washington State Governor Bob Ferguson emphasized the importance of community colleges and support for financially challenged students during the event. Other speakers included Shoreline Community College President Jack Kahn and Foundation Executive Director Wendy J. Coates. Notably, student testimonials highlighted the impact of donor support. Lily Taylor, a 27-year-old GED student, shared how assistance helped her stabilize her needs and enroll in the Honors College, achieving goals she once deemed unattainable. Five additional students also spoke about how donor-funded support enabled them to remain in school and pursue their aspirations. The luncheon began with a land acknowledgement and concluded with a traditional song from Muckleshoot tribal member Justice Bill, symbolizing community and cultural respect. The event showcased the vital role of community support in helping students achieve stable lives and living-wage careers.
