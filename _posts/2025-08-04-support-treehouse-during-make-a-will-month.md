  Did you know August is National Make-a-Will Month? We did! Thanks to our partnership with [FreeWill](https://www.freewill.com/treehouse),&nbsp;you can make an act of care for your family—and maybe even students in foster care—in one easy move for free.&nbsp;

  But is it really that simple? According to Treehouse supporter Darian Lindle, yes.

  ### A Treehouse Supporter’s Make-a-Will Story

  “I first learned about Treehouse not long after I had my own kids,” says Darian. “I was moved by Treehouse’s mission and decided that I needed to make a small, regular contribution because what you are doing is so important and touches kids in my own community. Meeting a [Graduation Success](https://www.treehouseforkids.org/our-services/graduation-success/) Education Specialist and hearing about Treehouse behind the scenes cemented my admiration and respect for the way you work with kids in care. &nbsp;

  “I recently realized I needed to update my will, but I kept putting it off. I got an email from Treehouse with the link to FreeWill and thought, _Great—I can get this done quickly_.

  “On the FreeWill site, they asked if I wanted to leave anything to a nonprofit. I’d never considered it before, but all of my reasons for loving Treehouse are still valid—perhaps more so because my kids go to school with kids who have been/are in the foster care system. I’m not wealthy, but I know that every little bit helps. So, I typed in Treehouse, and all the info I needed auto-populated. Easy peasy. &nbsp;

  “I’m grateful an organization like Treehouse exists. I’m grateful I can trust Treehouse to keep doing the work I can’t to help kids in care and give them a brighter present and future.”

  Treehouse is so grateful to supporters like Darian, whose forward-thinking [legacy giving](https://www.treehouseforkids.org/take-action/give/#legacygiving) contributions ensure our services can reach students in foster care whenever they need them.&nbsp;
