This year’s Día de los Muertos Celebration at Plaza Roberto Maestas brought together approximately 2,500 community members and 28 local vendors to honor loved ones through art, music, and tradition. The event showcased the community's unity and resilience, even amidst challenging weather, and highlighted the contributions of performers, emcees, partners, and volunteers who made it possible. 

The theme of the ofrenda exhibit, "Semillas de Justicia: Luchando por Dignidad y Democracia" (Seeds of Justice: Fighting for Dignity and Democracy), focused on honoring those who resisted oppression, including civil rights martyrs, Indigenous land defenders, and activists. Various organizations, such as Beacon Arts and Chief Seattle Club, contributed to the vibrant community ofrendas that celebrated life, culture, and justice.

Additionally, Teacher Rocio’s Pre-K students at the José Martí Child Development Center engaged in crafting piñatas in preparation for the upcoming Las Posadas celebration and Christmas market. El Centro de la Raza emphasizes that every event and act of service fosters a more just and united community.
