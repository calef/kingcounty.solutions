  As we reflect on the retirement of Deputy Fire Chief Rick Olson, we feel a mix of emotions and gratitude for his years of dedicated service and sadness at losing a remarkable leader. Chief Olson has been an integral part of our community and the Valley Regional Fire Authority (VRFA), profoundly impacting his colleagues and the citizens he serves.

  Chief Olson began his career with the legacy Auburn Fire Department on January 11, 1999. That first day marked the beginning of an incredible journey that would see him rise through the ranks, driven by an unwavering desire to help people. His journey truly reflects the essence of public service, where the rewards come not from accolades but from the lives touched and saved.

  Before joining VRFA, Chief Olson began his fire service journey as a Volunteer Firefighter with Mountain View Fire and Rescue in 1996. His experience in the custom cabinet industry sharpened his attention to detail, a skill that has proven invaluable throughout his firefighting career. “Every component in a project influences the outcome,” he remarked, a philosophy that he believes applies to the challenges faced in emergency response.

  Over his 26 years of service, Chief Olson achieved numerous milestones, including promotions to Captain in 2009, Battalion Chief in 2019, and Deputy Chief in 2021.

  When Chief Olson faced challenges throughout his career, he viewed them not as barriers but as opportunities for growth. His hands-on experience spans various teams and committees, from Technical Rescue to the Planning and Logistics Division, where he played a crucial role in equipment standardization and budget building. After a lengthy wildland fire deployment in Eastern Washington, he recognized the need to bolster awareness of the Wildland Urban Interface threat. Using that experience, he worked with several other firefighters to develop a program that has made our community and firefighters safer.

  Awards like Fire Officer of the Year in 2014 and a Professional Excellence award in 2023 speak to his dedication and effectiveness in leadership roles. However, Chief Olson believes that the most significant rewards stem from saving lives, and the connections formed with both colleagues and the community.

  Reflecting on his career, Chief Olson acknowledges the friendships and experiences that have shaped him. From the laughter shared during shifts to the tragic moments that forge deep bonds, each experience has added to his wealth of memories.

  Fire Chief Brad Thompson shared, “Rick and I have shared remarkably similar career paths. I’ve been fortunate to witness his steadfast leadership, strength of character, and unwavering commitment to the VRFA up close. His influence on the VRFA and my own fire service journey has been profound and will last long past his retirement. I can’t possibly thank Rick enough for his service and his friendship.”

  Deputy Chief Tim Day echoed this sentiment, stating, “Rick is an outstanding public servant. He’s given his full effort in every assignment at the VRFA, leaving a lasting and impactful legacy. Our communities are safer because of his work. He’ll be greatly missed.”

  As he steps into retirement, Chief Olson looks forward to spending quality time with his wife and exploring personal passions. “I never really left my love for woodworking behind,” he mentions enthusiastically, alongside his newfound interest in gardening and fishing.

  In closing, Chief Olson emphasizes the importance of curiosity within the fire service. His approach to understanding how to continuously improve, coupled with the pursuit of viable solutions, has been a cornerstone of his career.

  As we bid farewell to Deputy Fire Chief Olson, we celebrate a legacy marked by service, dedication, and an unwavering commitment to the community. His presence will be greatly missed, but his impact will continue to inspire generations of firefighters at the Valley Regional Fire Authority.

  Thank you, Chief Olson, for your service. May your retirement be filled with joy, adventure, and relaxation. You have earned it!
