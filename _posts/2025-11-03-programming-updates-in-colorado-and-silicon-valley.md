Reading Partners has transitioned from direct tutoring programs in public schools in Colorado and Silicon Valley to a new community-based model focusing on local partnerships. This change aims to maintain their commitment to improving literacy for students. Collaborations with libraries allow Reading Partners to deliver personalized tutoring using their Reading Partners Connects curriculum. They are training library and school staff to provide high-quality literacy support, empowering local leaders to take charge of the programs. 

In Denver, a new tutoring program at Harris Park Library is set to enroll 30 students, with tutoring starting in November. Similar efforts are underway in Seattle, where partnerships are expected to launch in January. In San Jose, tutoring will be offered at two library branches, with an anticipated impact on around 30 families. This model emphasizes community integration and aims to expand access to literacy support. Reading Partners remains committed to fostering strong relationships within the communities they serve, ensuring every child has the opportunity to become a confident reader.
