The Trapper & Samantha Wellbeing Support Center is a new initiative at Valley's Cancer Center, set to open on February 3. It aims to assist cancer patients and their families through various resources, including comfort items, educational programs, and specialized support. This center is part of Valley's commitment to provide comprehensive, compassionate care right from the start of a patient's treatment journey. 

The center offers several free services such as a Wig, Hat, and Scarf Bank for those experiencing hair loss, a Support Cart filled with comforting items like blankets and charging cords, and Personal Health Manager Kits to help patients manage their medical information. Additionally, it provides cancer education and connects patients with essential community resources, including transportation and social work services.

The establishment of this center was made possible through the generosity of local business leaders Trapper and Samantha, who have a personal connection to cancer, as Samantha is now in remission. This initiative reflects Valley's vision that effective cancer care encompasses not just medical treatment but also supports the overall wellbeing of patients—physically, emotionally, educationally, and socially.
