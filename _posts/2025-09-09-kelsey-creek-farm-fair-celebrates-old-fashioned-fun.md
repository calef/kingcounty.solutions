The Kelsey Creek Farm Fair will take place on Saturday, October 4, from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., celebrating nearly 50 years of tradition. Attendees can enjoy activities such as meeting farm animals, collecting pumpkins, pony rides, and decorating pumpkins. The event will also feature hands-on heritage activities, animal viewing, children’s activities, pedal tractors, and tractor-pulled wagon rides, along with food trucks. Free shuttles will be available from Bannerwood Sports Park and the Wilburton park and ride to Kelsey Creek Farm, with the last shuttle departing the farm at 4:15 p.m. Kelsey Creek Farm, which encompasses 150 acres of forest, meadows, and wetlands, was originally part of Twin Valley Dairy, established in the 1920s. Fifty years later, the City of Bellevue acquired the farm and turned it into a public park. Visitors should note that there is no ATM on site, some activities may have fees, and pets are not allowed in the barnyard area. For more details, individuals can call or email Kelsey Creek Farm.
