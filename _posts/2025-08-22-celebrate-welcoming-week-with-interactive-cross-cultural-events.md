Bellevue will celebrate Welcoming Week from September 12-21, joining other Eastside cities and community organizations to promote inclusion and connection among residents of diverse backgrounds. This national celebration emphasizes affirmation of inclusion, particularly for new residents. Since 2016, East King County has participated in Welcoming Week, organizing events through local nonprofits, neighborhood associations, and libraries. The mayors of Bellevue, Issaquah, Kirkland, Redmond, and Sammamish will issue a joint proclamation to encourage community participation in these events. Bellevue Mayor Lynne Robinson emphasized the importance of diversity and inclusion in building a strong community. Throughout September, Bellevue community centers will host cultural arts performances, with a key event on September 15 featuring “The Bellevue We Hope to See: A Storytelling Event” at the Bellevue Botanical Garden. Additionally, the September 20 event “From Stories to Strength: Creating Cross-Cultural Collaborations” has been canceled. For those needing accommodations or alternate formats, Bellevue encourages contacting their office in advance.
