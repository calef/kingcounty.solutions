FamilyWorks Seattle has announced a temporary relocation of its food bank. The food bank will operate out of the FamilyWorks Family Resource Center located at 1501 N. 45th St., Seattle, WA 98103, starting on Jan. 10, 2024. This move is necessary due to renovations being made to the current food bank space. The food bank will maintain its regular hours, which are Wednesdays from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. During this period of relocation, clients are encouraged to visit the new location for food assistance. FamilyWorks emphasizes its commitment to the community and aims to minimize any disruptions during the transition. Clients are invited to reach out for further information or assistance regarding the temporary change in location.
