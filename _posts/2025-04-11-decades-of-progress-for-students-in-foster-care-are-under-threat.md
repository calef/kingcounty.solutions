title: Decades of progress for students in foster care are under threat
topics:

Graduation rates for students in foster care in Washington have increased significantly, from 36.1% in 2013 to 51.2% in recent years, nearly doubling the rate of their peers. This progress is the result of two decades of dedicated efforts by lawmakers and organizations. However, proposed state budget cuts threaten these advancements, risking the stability and success of thousands of marginalized students. Despite the improvements, the graduation rate for youth in foster care remains substantially lower than the statewide average of 82.8%. Students in foster care face unique challenges, including frequent placement changes and limited access to educational resources, which hinder their academic progress. Treehouse advocates for educational parity, emphasizing that providing support is essential for success. The organization assists over 6,000 youth in foster care annually, offering tailored academic support and advocacy. Last year, over 170 students graduated with post-secondary plans, illustrating the positive impact of such support. Cutting funding for programs like Treehouse would result in fewer resources and reduced academic success for these students, ultimately affecting the community and state as a whole. Investments in education for youth in foster care are crucial for building a stronger, more resilient Washington.
