Justice, Professionalism, Service. The King County Bar Association (KCBA) has filed an amicus brief in support of the law firm Susman Godfrey, which faced an executive order claiming it undermined American elections due to its efforts to provide employment opportunities to students of color. This brief, submitted on April 25, 2025, highlights the firm's role in the successful defamation case against Fox News for Dominion Voting Systems. KCBA's Board of Trustees endorsed this action, aligning with other bar associations, including those from New York City, Boston, and Chicago, to advocate for the protection of the rule of law. The statement emphasizes that this support does not represent the views of individual KCBA members but reflects a collective stance on the critical issues of democracy and civil rights. The KCBA acknowledges the contributions of the Protect Democracy Project and Harvard Law students in preparing the brief, showcasing a united front from various legal organizations in defending equitable practices in legal employment and supporting firms that uphold democratic values.
