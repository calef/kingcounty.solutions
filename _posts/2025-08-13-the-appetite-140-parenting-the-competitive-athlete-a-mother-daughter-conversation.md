A recent episode of "The Appetite" podcast features a conversation between Kara Bazzi, an experienced athlete and mother, and her daughter Sophia, a soon-to-be collegiate athlete. They reflect on their journey through high school sports, focusing on the complexities of parenting a competitive athlete. Kara shares insights from her history of eating disorder recovery and how it influences her parenting. Sophia discusses her transition from various sports to specializing in cross country and track, highlighting the positive impact of supportive family dynamics and the importance of community in sports. Both emphasize the significance of allowing young athletes to explore their interests without the pressure of early specialization. The conversation touches on challenges like parental expectations, managing schedules, and the emotional toll of competition. Kara and Sophia agree on the value of open communication about feelings after races and the need for understanding each other's perspectives.
