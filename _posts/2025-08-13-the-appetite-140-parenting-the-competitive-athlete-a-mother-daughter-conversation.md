  dir=\"ltr\">Transcription brought to you by:  Rev.com</p>\n<p>Lexi Giblin (<u>00:06</u>):</p>\n<p>Welcome
  to the Appetite, a podcast brought to you by Opal Food and Body Wisdom, an eating
  disorder treatment clinic in Seattle, Washington. On this podcast, we talk about
  all things food, body movement, and mental health. I am Dr. Lexi Giblin, your host
  for today, and I have a special duo in the studio With me today we have Kara Bazi
  and her daughter Sophia. Hi Kara. Hi Sophia. Welcome. Thank you. So many of you
  probably know that we treat athletes at Opal. It&#8217;s an area of specialization
  and movement and athletes, and we&#8217;ve recently started taking 16 and older
  clients, and in addition to that, Julie, Cara and I are all parenting athletes,
  teen athletes as we speak. So we thought that this was a helpful, potentially helpful
  conversation to have on air to give all of you out there who are parenting athletes
  a glimpse into what we&#8217;ve thought through and some of the experiences we&#8217;ve
  had. And today we&#8217;re going to get to dive into Kara and Sophia&#8217;s experience
  together as a parent and athlete and hopefully learn more about how we can support
  our loved ones as athletes and navigate the very complicated waters of the adolescent
  sports world.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>01:47</u>):</p>\n<p>Yes,</p>\n<p>Lexi Giblin
  (<u>01:48</u>):</p>\n<p>Yes. And as you&#8217;ll here, Sophia is going to be running
  in college and my daughter is playing basketball in college. So we are still in
  this active parenting of athletes even as they leave there or into their later teen
  years. So Sophia and Kara tell us, just give us a little sense of what you all give
  us some background.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>02:18</u>):</p>\n<p>Sure. I can start
  and then Sophia can fill in some gaps. So let&#8217;s see. Our family, Sophia has
  a younger sister, Hannah, two years younger. Sophia is just graduated from high
  school. Woo. So that&#8217;s been exciting. We just finished her senior track season.
  Sophia and Hannah are both cross country and track athletes as children. They participated
  in a lot of different sports at the youth level through middle school. Then let&#8217;s
  see, Sophia COVID hit when Sophia was in middle school. So that gives some context
  there and that really shaped and changed the sport journey for them, and they both
  got more involved in distance running. And let&#8217;s see, David and I as their
  parents, we are both distance runners ourselves. We both ran collegiately at the
  University of Washington, so that is the sport that we took the farthest and the
  highest level of competition.</p>\n<p>(<u>03:20</u>):</p>\n<p>And we now have two
  runners. Our daughters are both in that sport, so that is important context in this
  conversation. My husband David is also has coached for 20 years in the sport of
  distance running and has recently coached Sophia and Hannah in this latest track
  season. And I had the opportunity to coach at the high school level in cross country
  this fall for Sophia and Hannah. So we have the perspective as parents, we have
  the perspective as coaches. And then the last piece I think is relevant to this
  conversation, especially on the appetite is most people know that have followed
  our podcast that I have a history of an eating disorder. My eating disorder emerged
  through the context of collegiate athletics at my University of Washington journey.
  And so I have gone through a transformational healing myself. That&#8217;s what
  got me into this field, and therefore that has seeped its way into my parenting.
  It seeped its way into my parenting of athletes and in particular in the sport of
  distance running that has historically a very high rate of disordered eating and
  eating disorders. So a lot of different pieces. Sophia, am I missing anything?</p>\n<p>Sophia
  Bazzi (<u>04:38</u>):</p>\n<p>No, I think you&#8217;ve pretty much covered it. Yeah,
  I would say I&#8217;ve been running track in cross country since seventh grade.
  Well cross country since seventh grade. So I&#8217;ve been doing it now for six
  years. And I have kind of been coached by both of you a little bit on the way you&#8217;ve
  been very involved in the whole process, but I think it wasn&#8217;t until this
  year that you were both actually my coaches in an official capacity. So that has
  been different, but it&#8217;s been kind of a journey together for six years so
  far. Yes.</p>\n<p>Lexi Giblin (<u>05:10</u>):</p>\n<p>Something maybe I would add
  is that Kara and David are both really high achieving athletes. I mean, they were
  UDub athletes, division one athletes, and I know Kara did amazing things with running
  and your dad was an All-American. And so I wonder if we could start there and just
  hear some of how you&#8217;ve taken that in growing up. Has there been a sense of,
  oh, high expectations because I am from these two amazing athletes?</p>\n<p>Sophia
  Bazzi (<u>05:47</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah, I mean, I think as a kid I was just very, my
  parents are so impressive. It was a very sense of pride. I like telling my friends
  that, especially with my dad, that he was the record holder at UDub in the 5K and
  the 10 K has been something that I always thought was so impressive, but I don&#8217;t
  think I felt necessarily a pressure to live up to that. I think it started, I was
  kind of avoidant of the sport. I didn&#8217;t want to get involved in cross country
  and track. I was not interested in it. I was very interested in other sports like
  soccer and volleyball and things like that. So I think that&#8217;s kind of how
  I wanted to carve my own path and be involved in something else. That was kind of
  how maybe that manifested, and I think I was going to be involved in volleyball
  more competitively.</p>\n<p>(<u>06:32</u>):</p>\n<p>That was my plan to go to high
  school, play volleyball, but then obviously COVID hit and I couldn&#8217;t play
  volleyball. So that&#8217;s kind of what got me involved more deeply in cross country
  is that was the only sport. I love sports, and that was the only sport it was really
  able to do because it&#8217;s outdoors. It was more safe I guess. So that&#8217;s
  what got me involved in that. But I think now that I&#8217;ve been involved in it
  for a while, I don&#8217;t think that there&#8217;s been, in my mind a lot of pressure
  to live up to that standard. But I think it&#8217;s just been cool to have the support
  of my parents knowing what they&#8217;ve been thorough and they&#8217;ve been competing
  at a high level. I think especially in my recruiting process, they were such a good
  resource and they just know so much. And with mom&#8217;s experience with eating
  disorders and knowing what to look out for with coaches and with the team culture,
  maybe red flags I guess of things to look at was so helpful. So I think it&#8217;s
  definitely been a resource and something I&#8217;ve been proud of versus something
  I felt was a sense of pressure.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>07:38</u>):</p>\n<p>Wow,
  that&#8217;s actually cool to hear. I didn&#8217;t know what you were going to say.
  Yeah,</p>\n<p>Lexi Giblin (<u>07:44</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah. I mean I can see that they
  are resourced and David helped my daughter Ila with the recruitment process and
  you have so much resource within your family, so I can see how it would be felt
  that way. I wonder if you would take a moment and reflect on your decisions around
  the time at which you started running. And I know in Seattle area, and I think across
  the nation, kids are doing club sport year round and traveling for sport at a young
  age year round. And I am curious what your theories are the way you have a thinking
  about that and how that impacted your decisions to either push or encourage or not
  encourage Sophia to go into something year round and hardcore at an early age.</p>\n<p>Kara
  Bazzi (<u>08:44</u>):</p>\n<p>So I think informed by both David and I as athletes
  and what I&#8217;ve learned in my own professional line of work, I was very aware
  of early sports specialization with athletes and cautious about that. I think from
  interestingly in the sport of distance running, there is some more freedom around
  timing. I think that there might be more pressure now in the changing landscape,
  especially of collegiate and NCAA sports, of some of the changes that are happening
  there with roster size limits. And that can leak some pressure down to the high
  school level of having to compete at a higher level in order to get recruited. But
  at the time that David and I were athletes, NCAA would take developing athletes
  so we were not, running was actually secondary sport for me. I was a basketball
  player. That was more of the dream I had for college sports.</p>\n<p>(<u>09:50</u>):</p>\n<p>And
  so I wasn&#8217;t running high mileage in high school. I didn&#8217;t feel a lot
  of pressure. My recruiting journey was very different than Sophia&#8217;s in the
  sense that I got recruited by a coach who was coaching one of my relatives. And
  so he took a chance on me given my genetic background. And David, he also didn&#8217;t
  get very serious about running until high school. So neither of us had the youth
  experience of being in the sport at a young age and we succeeded. We were very successful
  in college. And so we have a strong belief in patience and not overworking a young
  athlete. And then of course, all the knowledge I have now from my field around physiologically
  what youth athletes need from a mental health perspective. So that has been really
  important in our parenting, being patient not over-training, not finding sport environments
  and coaches along the way that share that philosophy that we don&#8217;t want to
  burn our kids out early.</p>\n<p>(<u>10:59</u>):</p>\n<p>And we do see that within
  the sport world, even in the distance running community of kids that are running
  higher mileage and really bringing some intensity early on and they&#8217;re getting
  results, outcome results for that. But we see this as a sport. We want them, both
  my girls, we want them to be able to participate for the rest of their lives if
  they&#8217;d like to. So we&#8217;re looking at the long-term, at the long-term,
  and in that way we&#8217;ve had protection over them around especially around mileage
  and just how are they responding to it? Do they still like it? It&#8217;s really
  important that that piece is still a part of their experience because that&#8217;s
  what also is the biggest motivator.</p>\n<p>Lexi Giblin (<u>11:44</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah.
  Sophia, what are your thoughts? Would you have wanted to go in more deeply into
  running year round or pushing harder earlier?</p>\n<p>Sophia Bazzi (<u>11:53</u>):</p>\n<p>Definitely
  not. I think I really liked having a lot of sports, playing a lot of sports when
  I was younger. And I think there&#8217;s a lot to be said about just doing different
  things, trying things out, and just the community aspect of that. I think honestly
  what got me into running was just the people and not the sport. And I wasn&#8217;t
  even that invested for the first year. I just really liked the people and I felt
  myself drawn back for that reason. And I think my love for the sport developed out
  of that. And I think I made a lot of my closest friends through sports as a child.
  So I think that specializing early would&#8217;ve limited a lot of that opportunity.
  And there&#8217;s so much time to specialize, especially with running, there&#8217;s
  not a lot of skills necessarily to learn. So I didn&#8217;t feel like I was at a
  disadvantage by only getting very serious about it once I went to high school. And
  I just think it gave me a more well-rounded perspective on sports in general. So
  I do not, I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t specialize early. Okay.</p>\n<p>Lexi Giblin
  (<u>12:56</u>):</p>\n<p>Well, I love that you&#8217;re thinking about, it&#8217;s
  the relationships that mattered and sports are sort of an outgrowth of the connections
  you felt. Love that. And I feel that with in Eli&#8217;s experience as well, it&#8217;s
  the team that really is driving her interest in pushing. So I love that. What would
  you say has been both helpful and hard in the parent child interactions regarding
  sport?</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>13:27</u>):</p>\n<p>You want me to start? Okay. I
  think I just start by talking about it through the lens of what I&#8217;ve seen
  clinically to start with and then I can share a little bit more personally clinically
  what I see from, especially through, we&#8217;ve talked about the rethinking exercise
  and sport process group that I&#8217;ve run weekly for 13 years. So I get to hear
  lots of stories. I get to hear a lot of different people&#8217;s lived experiences.
  And I would say some of the most challenging things I hear is when our clients talk
  about that parental pressure in sport and where it gets linked to achievement gets
  linked to worth or even when I will often hear that clients will say their parents
  made them do sports, at least be actively engaged. And I think there can be some
  tie to diet culture in that the sense of you have to be doing something, a sport
  to be moving.</p>\n<p>(<u>14:26</u>):</p>\n<p>And for some people that&#8217;s rooted
  in something really healthy. And for others that could be around weight management
  or a sense of competency because you&#8217;re involved in sport. So I think that
  I hear those stories, that&#8217;s a common pattern. And in that way, I think the
  question is who is this for? What is it that the actually want or need or what are
  their goals versus the parents&#8217; wants or needs or goals? So I think that can
  be part of what is tricky in the parent and child interaction is like who wants
  it? Is it the parent that wants it or does the kid want it? I think the other challenge
  is managing time and schedule and all the things that come with sports, especially
  the year-round sports, the club sports on top of the high school sports for example,
  and all the time that takes and the travel that takes and figuring out when are
  they going to get nutrition.</p>\n<p>(<u>15:26</u>):</p>\n<p>And just the challenge
  of literally that scheduling aspect of it. And there&#8217;s the disparity around
  families that have the resources to do that and families that don&#8217;t. Another
  dynamic is parents over involvement or under involvement, parents that really get
  a lot of their own needs met through the sport and are highly involved. And then
  the ones that are never showing up to practices or to games or to competitions.
  And then the final dynamic I think is pretty alive is the failure piece. So kids
  like parents trying to protect their athletes or their kids from being distressed.
  And there&#8217;s a lot of distress that can come from sport, especially around
  performance and competition. And it&#8217;s just that whole dynamic with parents
  watching the heartbreak that their kids are going through and maybe wanting to help
  them avoid that versus all the lessons that can come in the hard parts.</p>\n<p>(<u>16:36</u>):</p>\n<p>So
  I think I would say those are the dynamics that are, I hear often from the clinical
  ends. And then personally, yes, all of the above. So I appreciate what Sophia said
  about pressure. I think David and I both have really, we really wanted Hannah and
  Sophia to decide what they wanted to do with their bodies, what they want to do
  with sport. We know obviously we both love the sport of running and we&#8217;re
  highly involved and gave them access to a lot of resources, but they ultimately
  needed to decide if they want it. And they get to choose every day. They get to
  choose every year if this is something they want to still be involved in. And Sophia
  particularly, I think shows she has the characteristics, in my opinion, of somebody
  who would be more drawn to working towards being a collegiate athlete, competitive,
  very internally driven.</p>\n<p>(<u>17:41</u>):</p>\n<p>And so I think that has
  both been very fun and hard. I&#8217;ll speak, my husband would his own opinions
  about this, but for me it&#8217;s been both fun and hard because I relate to her.
  I mean a lot of, I was very internally competitive as well. And so there&#8217;s
  a relatability between me and her in that. And there&#8217;s both the funness of
  understanding it, but then the hardness of going through with her and in the sense
  of just especially around her goals, what she wants, what she is hoping for, especially
  when we&#8217;re getting closer to that recruiting process and running in college,
  I think that is I can easily just have my empathy channel open. And so I felt there
  was a lot of feelings I was feeling alongside, but really wanting her to have her
  own experience and not just trying to strike a balance of being human in it as a
  mom, but then also letting her have her own experience. And for all of us parents,
  that&#8217;s a tough balance to hit really tough. And especially I think in the
  last two years has been particularly, again, just more salient with it getting closer
  to the college time.</p>\n<p>Sophia Bazzi (<u>19:04</u>):</p>\n<p>And I think I
  would say it&#8217;s been good in a lot of ways because you both do care a lot.
  I&#8217;d say on the spectrum of not involved to very involved. My parents are very
  involved in my sport journey, which has been great because in a lot of ways, because
  it&#8217;s a very strong support system, and I always know that they&#8217;re going
  to be there for me, they&#8217;re at every race, especially my dad being, at least
  my coach or the coach of our brother&#8217;s school is always at the meets. And
  mom always makes a point to go to all the meets. So I think it&#8217;s good to know
  that it&#8217;s some stability to know that that&#8217;s always a constant no matter
  how the race goes. So that&#8217;s been really great. But I do think it can be hard
  in some ways just because I know how much they care and I care so much as well.</p>\n<p>(<u>19:49</u>):</p>\n<p>So
  when things don&#8217;t go necessarily the way I want, I definitely have struggled
  with feeling like I&#8217;m disappointing them. And I know in some ways that that
  is an irrational fear and that they&#8217;re not disappointed by me, but because
  I&#8217;m disappointed in myself and I know how much they want me to succeed because
  they want me to be happy and to that&#8217;s what a parent wants for their kid is
  to succeed, even though that might not be the top priority. If I&#8217;m not succeeding
  in my mind, I feel like I get a strong sense of feeling like I&#8217;m disappointing
  them. And that&#8217;s very hard, and it can come with some shame or embarrassment.
  So it&#8217;s sometimes hard for me to separate that. And I would also say just
  because it doesn&#8217;t leave necessarily when I leave the track, the feelings
  are still there going home and things like that, it&#8217;s hard to separate it
  all. And I sometimes feel with a hard race or something that I just want to avoid
  all the feelings. And it&#8217;s hard to avoid the feelings when everyone has been
  there and knows what you experienced and wants to process with you. So I think that
  can be a little bit of a challenge.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>21:00</u>):</p>\n<p>One
  thing I would say this last track season, there&#8217;s been a lot of learning and
  a lot of different things that have been more challenging maybe around just not
  meeting some of the goals she wanted to meet. And one of the things that I feel
  like this could be good to share because it would probably be relevant to listeners,
  is one of the things that was good learning was asking Sophia how she felt. I think
  it gets easy to make assumptions of, oh no, Sophia&#8217;s going to feel X, Y, and
  Z after this race. And just trying to really suspend that and wait to see actually
  how she felt. What was her assessment, what did she feel about, how did she feel
  about how it all went? So to really try to suspend my own assumptions and not project
  what I might think she feels, but really just ask her and start with questions.
  And of course if she doesn&#8217;t want to engage in questions right away, that&#8217;s
  fine, but what was that like for you? What are you experiencing? What do you feel
  proud of? What do you feel was hard? So much better to go that direction than just
  assuming certain things about how she was going to feel about at the end of the
  race?</p>\n<p>(<u>22:13</u>):</p>\n<p>I was very intentional about that,</p>\n<p>Lexi
  Giblin (<u>22:16</u>):</p>\n<p>Not jumping to conclusions. And a lot of times, I
  think Kara, I think you&#8217;ve said this before, it&#8217;s when your kid is distressed
  about their sports performance, that&#8217;s hard as a parent, that&#8217;s very
  different than being distressed because of their performance.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi
  (<u>22:34</u>):</p>\n<p>Exactly.</p>\n<p>Lexi Giblin (<u>22:36</u>):</p>\n<p>And
  it&#8217;s sort of like you said, the empathy channel is wide open. And so that
  feeling, the feeling of what they&#8217;re feeling is more of what I connect to
  about it being hard to be a parent of an athlete. It feels like you&#8217;re out
  there with them because you&#8217;re close to them and their experience. And so
  I am with you that feeling of like, oh, she&#8217;s fine about it. Okay, great.
  Moving on.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>23:04</u>):</p>\n<p>Yes, a hundred percent. Yeah.</p>\n<p>Lexi
  Giblin (<u>23:07</u>):</p>\n<p>Say more about what it&#8217;s been like to have
  a parent as a coach. The good and the heart mean. So you&#8217;re living with your
  coach. What has this been like?</p>\n<p>Sophia Bazzi (<u>23:19</u>):</p>\n<p>I mean,
  I think in a lot of ways it has been good. I trust him so much, especially with
  my dad being my head track coach this year. I trust him so much. I know that he
  has my best interest at heart and that trust is already built. And with my mom too,
  being the assistant coach for cross country that they want what&#8217;s best for
  you. So it&#8217;s easy to know. I trust the race plan, I trust all that, and just
  to know that they&#8217;re always going to support me and all that is really great.
  But I think the big challenge this year has been separating the coach from the parent
  and when are we in that dynamic versus when we&#8217;re in the other dynamic? And
  I think it&#8217;s been hard to separate at home, especially with my dad. I just
  think we talk about it so much.</p>\n<p>(<u>24:07</u>):</p>\n<p>There was a time
  where I was like, this is just too much. Because we would talk about it at the track,
  we&#8217;d talk about it at home, and that was coming from me and him and my mom
  too. It was just hard to separate. So I think we really needed to work on when we
  were communicating about track and when we tried to take a step back from that and
  also be just a parent and a kid that is not completely separate from the racing
  and the sport. And I think we really worked on that and made it a lot better through
  only we would teams message on Microsoft teams about track. And then when we would
  text, it wouldn&#8217;t be about track. And when I got home, if I didn&#8217;t want
  to talk about track, we wouldn&#8217;t talk about track. It just is hard, especially
  when things aren&#8217;t going my way. If I had a tough workout or a tough race,
  it&#8217;s like I just need some time where I&#8217;m not a track athlete. And our
  dynamic doesn&#8217;t need to include that because it hasn&#8217;t. And it&#8217;s
  not only that. So I think that that was just an important balance to strike because
  it would get pretty overwhelming when I felt like I couldn&#8217;t escape the feelings
  of the track season and what was going on. And I just liked to have some separation
  with that.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>25:18</u>):</p>\n<p>I mean, the only thing I would
  say, I had this brief high school coaching experience in the fall as an assistant,
  and I just think the world of Sophia&#8217;s coaches that I was working with, I
  loved getting that opportunity. And I think what was cool is I&#8217;ve been around
  coaches my whole life. I&#8217;m married one, but to have, I&#8217;m going to keep
  going back to empathy, I guess, to have the actual experience of a high school coach,
  especially female high school coach, just gave me so much insight into that life
  and that world. And I love coaches. I think especially in that high school world,
  there&#8217;s so much care for these athletes, and I got to see how tough it is.
  The timing of practice for a lot of these coaches, especially female coaches, they&#8217;re
  leaving their family to go coach and they&#8217;re navigating parenting and their
  other job and coaching, and you&#8217;re putting in a ton of hours as a coach and
  you don&#8217;t get paid much.</p>\n<p>(<u>26:27</u>):</p>\n<p>You put in a ton
  of hours. At least in this sport, you don&#8217;t. And so the care for the athlete
  is so visible and visceral, and then I got to be a part of it, and I love my kids
  immensely. And then I just got to love the whole team. It was like my heart got
  opened to caring and loving for this whole group of people. So it was neat to really
  get to have that felt experience of what a high school coach goes through. And then
  of course, I got as a parent, then I got more access to my kids with them. So a
  lot of the coaches are leaving their families and their kids, but as a parent coach,
  you&#8217;re getting to be with your kids more. And I think we did a pretty good
  job. I checked in with the kids quite often about how I was showing up and trying
  to not try to hide the fact that I&#8217;m their mom, I am their mom. And trying
  to be also just cognizant of how do I not deny that identity, but also be a coach
  and be there for all the rest of the team and just kind of love on everybody. So
  I think I struck that balance pretty well. I dunno, Sophia, if you,</p>\n<p>Sophia
  Bazzi (<u>27:43</u>):</p>\n<p>I think you did. Yeah. Yeah. I think especially in
  the cross country season, I think the emotions are heightened in all ways when it&#8217;s
  like you&#8217;re the parent and the coach because you care deeply as a parent and
  you care deeply as a coach. So the highs are higher and the lows are lower, maybe
  a little bit. But I think we got a lot of that really good experiences I think in
  cross country especially. There was a moment when my dad&#8217;s team qualified
  for state for the first time and it was that he&#8217;s been there and it was just
  so exciting and we were all there to together and could just feel that excitement
  as a family. And I think that was really special. We&#8217;re all there together.
  This is now we joke, it&#8217;s like a family. We&#8217;re all doing this as a family
  coaching and all that and being the athletes. So</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>28:29</u>):</p>\n<p>It
  was exciting. He was coaching the boys team at the district meet, and then I was
  coaching Sophia and Hannah&#8217;s team at the district meet, and both teams qualified
  for state on the same day. And it was just one of those,</p>\n<p>Lexi Giblin (<u>28:43</u>):</p>\n<p>I
  was there Pinnacle. Yeah, you were there. That was a moment you were there. That
  was a moment. Was a moment. It was very, one of those brings tears to your eyes
  even though I&#8217;m outside of it. It was awesome. Awesome. Okay. Kara is obviously
  an eating disorder treatment expert. And what is it like to be raised by a mom who
  is deeply concerned about eating disorders and coming from a non-diet, weight inclusive
  approach?</p>\n<p>Sophia Bazzi (<u>29:19</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah, I think it&#8217;s
  been great. I think that is one of the things where I&#8217;ve felt really supported
  and knowing that think in some ways it&#8217;s a healthy balance of support. It&#8217;s
  like we&#8217;re trying to support you as an athlete and a person, but nothing in
  a way that would put your body in an unhealthy position or try and force results
  through something that really isn&#8217;t going to benefit you in the long run.
  So I think it was really, it&#8217;s so great to know that my parents are teaching
  me to look at a long-term approach and approach that&#8217;s the best, that&#8217;s
  looking at me as a person before being an athlete. And I think that that&#8217;s
  just contributed to me feeling really safe and supported with my family in the sport.
  And I also think it&#8217;s just taught me to be aware, I think in the recruiting
  process, especially of where the red flags are, and just to know what I need to
  be expecting and what a team culture should be like and what is not okay. And it
  helped me a lot in that process. And also even with my high school team, just being
  aware of things that maybe I were not the most healthy. And to be able to internalize
  that work on talking to the coach and trying to make changes to the culture to support
  all the athletes. And I think that that&#8217;s been good to be able to recognize
  when people are saying things or internalizing things that maybe are not the best
  for them as an athlete. So</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>30:55</u>):</p>\n<p>Do you want
  to give an example?</p>\n<p>Sophia Bazzi (<u>30:57</u>):</p>\n<p>Well, yeah, sure.
  I had a teammate a couple years ago saying that they had lost their period and they
  were like, it&#8217;s so great. I&#8217;m not bleeding anymore. It&#8217;s so convenient
  or whatever. And even the assistant coaches were like, that&#8217;s so great. I
  wish I could lose my period. That&#8217;d be so nice. Just no, not the hassle basically.
  And I kind of immediately was able to clock that as like, oh, that is not the best
  thing that that&#8217;s not going to be healthy in the long term. And that was something
  I was able to recognize, talk to my mom about and be like, okay. And trying to,
  without obviously exposing anyone or anything, talk to the coach and be like, Hey,
  I noticed this. I don&#8217;t think that this is something especially that the coaches
  should be supporting. I think that we maybe could have a conversation about why
  it&#8217;s important to have our period and just kind of raise awareness around
  that because that really concerned me for that person. I was wanting to make sure
  that she was doing what was right for her body. And also making sure that the team
  knows that isn&#8217;t maybe the right thing for anyone in the longterm. And just
  making sure that that&#8217;s not a part of the culture that we&#8217;re accepting,
  that we&#8217;re having conversations and knowing that that isn&#8217;t okay, and
  that we can know that we want better for ourselves.</p>\n<p>Lexi Giblin (<u>32:16</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah,
  it sounds like you&#8217;re a real leader around those issues, and I know you run
  the body image groove at your school. Yes, yes, I do. Yeah. Very cool. Well, tell
  me about a moment that stands out between the two of you in your sport experience</p>\n<p>Sophia
  Bazzi (<u>32:34</u>):</p>\n<p>Together. I can go first. I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re
  going to expect this one. Maybe. I said a track race at the Easton Track race in
  my sophomore year. I honestly don&#8217;t even remember how the race really went.
  I just know I was really disappointed with it. I think I was racing the mile and
  I think I was in a good position and kind of got passed by a lot of people at the
  end wasn&#8217;t feeling the best about it. But I think what really struck me about
  that wasn&#8217;t the performance, but my reaction to it afterwards. I think I was
  very, very, very upset. I wanted to quit. That was probably the most negative, strong,
  negative reaction I&#8217;ve had to erase in my high school career, which is kind
  of funny to think about now because I&#8217;ve had so many performances that might
  be considered objectively worse.</p>\n<p>(<u>33:24</u>):</p>\n<p>But I think I&#8217;ve
  been able to work a lot on my mental game and how I react to things and just my
  sense of worth. But I think at that time, my sense of worth was tied to performance
  a lot more and my performance, especially before that being a freshman, it&#8217;s
  my first time really being serious with the sport. I&#8217;ve been getting better,
  better, better, better. So I think that was my first time really having to deal
  with and cope with what happens when you don&#8217;t have the performance that you
  want. And I just remember being distraught. I was so upset and I was in the car
  with my mom and we just talked for, because it was kind of far away, we had to drive
  home. We were talking for probably an hour, and I was just kind of ranting and ranting
  and ranting.</p>\n<p>(<u>34:05</u>):</p>\n<p>And I think just what stood out to
  me was just how she listened to me and really just supported me in that moment and
  didn&#8217;t try and maybe necessarily make me feel better almost just being there
  and hearing me. And I think I just really needed to get that out. And so just having
  the space to do that and just feeling safe to literally say everything I wasn&#8217;t
  holding back. I was very, very upset. And just to have that space and then just
  to say the things that you just said, the right things, just saying the things that
  made me feel better and knowing, giving the perspective of this is not life or death.
  You are not defined by your performance. You&#8217;re not defined by your identity
  as an athlete and you&#8217;re like a person first. And that I think really helped
  me start the journey of working on my perspective as an athlete and my mental game
  and knowing that my performances don&#8217;t define me. And I think that sticks
  out in my mind as one of the starting points for that. And that wouldn&#8217;t have
  been possible if there wasn&#8217;t someone who was willing to just listen to me.
  And also because she has been through all of that, I think it just gives it more
  credibility in some ways. I was like, okay, if you can do it, I can do it. It&#8217;s
  just having that support from someone who&#8217;s been through that in the same
  sport that just really felt special. So</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>35:30</u>):</p>\n<p>Oh,
  it&#8217;s really sweet. So I remember that car ride. I do. And it&#8217;s cool
  to hear you name that as the most meaningful moment because it was kind of more
  of your original moment of really kind of having to navigate that because we&#8217;ve
  navigated more of those moments this last track season, your senior year. So it&#8217;s
  neat to hear that one was more poignant. It was more of where it really, that work
  opened up for you.</p>\n<p>Sophia Bazzi (<u>35:59</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah, because had
  a lot of experiences this year that have been very hard performances, but I think
  I&#8217;ve been able to handle it a lot better. It doesn&#8217;t get me down in
  the same way that it used to. So I think that that has been really cool to see of,
  yes, you can have bad performances, but it&#8217;s not going to hit me the same
  way anymore. And that was a lot of what makes me feel a lot more secure going into
  college and not knowing, I mean, I didn&#8217;t end my season on a good note at
  all, but I feel a lot of hope for the future, and I&#8217;m not super worried because
  I think I can handle it and I know what is really important to me, and it&#8217;s
  not necessarily just the performance anymore. So</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>36:43</u>):</p>\n<p>Cool.
  My gosh. Wow, that&#8217;s so awesome too, because here you go, growth from a generational
  growth. My collegiate experience was my worth was, I mean, this is what she&#8217;s
  saying about how I could understand my worth was tied in my performance, and I remember
  crying after every poor performance and I didn&#8217;t approach performances. You
  have this past track season, so it&#8217;s just so cool to see the development you&#8217;ve
  had and get to see how you&#8217;re now doing something very different from me.
  It&#8217;s really awesome. My gosh. Okay, well, my meaningful story moment, I&#8217;m
  taking that,</p>\n<p>Lexi Giblin (<u>37:25</u>):</p>\n<p>Is it right now? Maybe.</p>\n<p>Kara
  Bazzi (<u>37:26</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah, maybe. That is amazing. Sophia. Oh my gosh.
  Sometimes I&#8217;m like, wow, you&#8217;re so much more mature than me. I love
  it. You&#8217;re so awesome. But I had a really meaningful sport moment this track
  season, and maybe this is the recency bias because this is so recent, but Sophia
  has had an up and down season this track season in terms of performance. In terms
  of performance and the things that she&#8217;s, these responses and how she&#8217;s
  shown up have just blown me away. So this is another moment that actually Lexi was
  present for. So in our league, for those that don&#8217;t, I dunno, for different
  people listening from different sports, it was kind of our postseason experience
  of metro&#8217;s district and state. So this is the metro meet, qualifying meet
  for districts, and Sophia was coming into this sick, she had something happened
  over spring break and it kind of turned into this respiratory thing.</p>\n<p>(<u>38:34</u>):</p>\n<p>Horrible,
  horrible, horrible cough and just feeling really bad physically, really, really
  bad physically and track is a vulnerable sport for any of you that have done it.
  It&#8217;s very, you&#8217;re on display, you&#8217;re going around this oval track
  and everyone&#8217;s watching you, and she&#8217;s not feeling her best. She&#8217;s
  a senior, this is her senior season, everyone knows her. She&#8217;s on display
  and here she&#8217;s feeling vulnerable, sick, kind of awful, and not sure what
  her body&#8217;s going to do. And I think a little bit more scared of, is my body
  going to betray me in this race? And she had a doctor&#8217;s note to be ready to
  scratch her out of the meat if she needed to out of this race. And I remember being
  tearful as I&#8217;m seeing her on the infield, I don&#8217;t have much access because
  she&#8217;s on the infield warming up, and I&#8217;m not sure if she&#8217;s going
  to scratch till the very end.</p>\n<p>(<u>39:36</u>):</p>\n<p>And I&#8217;m tearful
  just like the vulnerability of her having to be out there and that decision. And
  then I see that she decides to race, and I think I was crying the entire race, Lexi,
  right, of the brave bravery of, and we will have maybe something to say this next
  question too, but the bravery in that moment of going out there and the vulnerable
  just showing up to being in this very vulnerable thing. And I just felt so connected
  to her and I connected because of vulnerable, I think of R-O-D-B-T. It was like
  a vulnerable decision, and that made me feel so connected to her no matter what
  her outcome was going to be in that race, it didn&#8217;t matter. It&#8217;s like
  she did something vulnerable and she did it in front of her community. And I had
  Lexi by my side, her coaches that just care deeply about her as a human being. I
  mean, the sense of closeness of my girl is a brave girl was just really meaningful.
  And then getting to celebrate that with her, again, not the outcome of the race,
  but just kind of recognizing what it means to show up to the line and what it means
  to be in this sport. It is an intimidating, vulnerable sport.</p>\n<p>Sophia Bazzi
  (<u>41:07</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah, I think showing up this year was especially hard because
  of all the, I was not feeling well for a long time and I would feel pretty sick
  or very fatigued going into most of my races. And I think we&#8217;ve been to some
  talks recently, some sports talks, me and my mom. And I think one of the things
  that really stood out to me is the most brave thing to do is just getting to the
  start line. It&#8217;s not even your result, how you finish, but it&#8217;s just
  not, the start line is more impressive than the finish line in some ways because
  it can be sometimes you&#8217;re overcoming a lot just to even get there. And it
  is very vulnerable to put yourself out there even knowing that you might not have
  the performance that you want. So that&#8217;s been</p>\n<p>Lexi Giblin (<u>41:49</u>):</p>\n<p>Cool.
  Yeah, what a special moment. And it was, I mean, just to watch you Sophia, but then
  to watch your mom connect to you about that and that moment was really beautiful
  and for all these reasons of bravery. Yeah. Yeah. What about heartbreaking moments
  this season?</p>\n<p>Sophia Bazzi (<u>42:12</u>):</p>\n<p>I can go first. Yeah.
  I think the most heartbreaking moment this season was the district smile that I
  raced in. And that was the first race that I dropped out of ever. And I think that
  was really hard for me in a lot of ways because I had always told myself, I&#8217;ll
  never drop out of a race. That is one thing I can control. I&#8217;m not going to
  let myself quit. It felt like quitting, and I really don&#8217;t like that as an
  idea. I always want to do my best and always stick it out. But I think that that
  was a really big learning experience for me because I had felt so terrible going
  into that. And that was more of a mental thing. I was dealing with a lot. There
  was a lot going on. I was going through all my graduation things. It was the most
  stressful weekend that I&#8217;ve had in a really long time, and I just felt really
  trapped and really panicked, and I was like, I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing
  here.</p>\n<p>(<u>43:03</u>):</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t want to do this. I felt like
  I was being forced into it almost, which is funny because no one was forcing me
  to do it, but by myself almost. And I was just in that race and I was like, this
  is not serving me. I am not, there&#8217;s not nothing good is coming out of this
  for me. And I just made the decision to step off the track. I wasn&#8217;t injured
  per se, so it wasn&#8217;t like it was necessary, but I just stepped off the track
  and I felt really, really, really disappointed with myself. I think that was the
  most disappointed with myself that I had felt in a while because I&#8217;d always
  told myself I would finish and I felt like I was breaking a promise to myself or
  something like that. But I think that what stood out to me after that with more
  perspective is just that is also a brave decision in its own way to step off and
  not finish a race.</p>\n<p>(<u>43:56</u>):</p>\n<p>And I think that I was making
  a decision that I needed to make in that moment because I was so, I just needed
  to know that I had some autonomy in that situation to make the own decision and
  to make a decision that benefited me as a person and not maybe as a competitor necessarily.
  And just to make space for myself when I need it. And yeah, that was a moment where
  I treated myself as a person who had a need to take a break versus an athlete who
  needed to make it to state. So I think that that was powerful in its own way. And
  I don&#8217;t want to drop out of many races in the future. I think that&#8217;s
  still something that I&#8217;m really going to work on not doing. But I think in
  that moment it made sense for me and I was able to accept that. And I think that
  was just powerful because I didn&#8217;t think I would be able to accept a decision
  like that in the past.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>44:49</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah. Wow. I mean,
  that was a moment. That&#8217;s my same answer for that one. It was learning for
  our family. I think public learning for, honestly, this sounds maybe dramatic, but
  for the running community, you choosing that and if people have the opportunity
  to hear that from you is a really powerful decision you made. I&#8217;m tearing
  up right now. It&#8217;s a very powerful decision because you can choose autonomy.
  You&#8217;re not forced into this. And so many athletes have these rules, I have
  to do this, or at least control the controllables. I will finish this thing even
  if my performance is bad. And I think it wasn&#8217;t out of pride. It was a decision
  that you were making for your mental wellness and what was best for you as a person.
  And if people and listeners can know that, I just think that, again, it opens up
  the door for whole person athlete decisions. It makes me think of, I mean, I know
  you&#8217;re not in the level of Simone Biles, but it makes me think of what Simone
  Biles did too, of choosing not to go into that competition in the Olympics. That
  there is some ways of choosing no, that is coming from bravery and not from fear,
  from shame.</p>\n<p>Lexi Giblin (<u>46:23</u>):</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s beautiful.
  One last question. Where are you running next year?</p>\n<p>Sophia Bazzi (<u>46:29</u>):</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m
  running at Gonzaga.</p>\n<p>Lexi Giblin (<u>46:31</u>):</p>\n<p>All right, go. Zs</p>\n<p>Sophia

  brought to you by:  Rev.com</p>\n<p>Lexi Giblin (<u>00:06</u>):</p>\n<p>Welcome
  to the Appetite, a podcast brought to you by Opal Food and Body Wisdom, an eating
  disorder treatment clinic in Seattle, Washington. On this podcast, we talk about
  all things food, body movement, and mental health. I am Dr. Lexi Giblin, your host
  for today, and I have a special duo in the studio With me today we have Kara Bazi
  and her daughter Sophia. Hi Kara. Hi Sophia. Welcome. Thank you. So many of you
  probably know that we treat athletes at Opal. It’s an area of specialization and
  movement and athletes, and we’ve recently started taking 16 and older clients, and
  in addition to that, Julie, Cara and I are all parenting athletes, teen athletes
  as we speak. So we thought that this was a helpful, potentially helpful conversation
  to have on air to give all of you out there who are parenting athletes a glimpse
  into what we’ve thought through and some of the experiences we’ve had. And today
  we’re going to get to dive into Kara and Sophia’s experience together as a parent
  and athlete and hopefully learn more about how we can support our loved ones as
  athletes and navigate the very complicated waters of the adolescent sports world.</p>\n<p>Kara
  Bazzi (<u>01:47</u>):</p>\n<p>Yes,</p>\n<p>Lexi Giblin (<u>01:48</u>):</p>\n<p>Yes.
  And as you’ll here, Sophia is going to be running in college and my daughter is
  playing basketball in college. So we are still in this active parenting of athletes
  even as they leave there or into their later teen years. So Sophia and Kara tell
  us, just give us a little sense of what you all give us some background.</p>\n<p>Kara
  Bazzi (<u>02:18</u>):</p>\n<p>Sure. I can start and then Sophia can fill in some
  gaps. So let’s see. Our family, Sophia has a younger sister, Hannah, two years younger.
  Sophia is just graduated from high school. Woo. So that’s been exciting. We just
  finished her senior track season. Sophia and Hannah are both cross country and track
  athletes as children. They participated in a lot of different sports at the youth
  level through middle school. Then let’s see, Sophia COVID hit when Sophia was in
  middle school. So that gives some context there and that really shaped and changed
  the sport journey for them, and they both got more involved in distance running.
  And let’s see, David and I as their parents, we are both distance runners ourselves.
  We both ran collegiately at the University of Washington, so that is the sport that
  we took the farthest and the highest level of competition.</p>\n<p>(<u>03:20</u>):</p>\n<p>And
  we now have two runners. Our daughters are both in that sport, so that is important
  context in this conversation. My husband David is also has coached for 20 years
  in the sport of distance running and has recently coached Sophia and Hannah in this
  latest track season. And I had the opportunity to coach at the high school level
  in cross country this fall for Sophia and Hannah. So we have the perspective as
  parents, we have the perspective as coaches. And then the last piece I think is
  relevant to this conversation, especially on the appetite is most people know that
  have followed our podcast that I have a history of an eating disorder. My eating
  disorder emerged through the context of collegiate athletics at my University of
  Washington journey. And so I have gone through a transformational healing myself.
  That’s what got me into this field, and therefore that has seeped its way into my
  parenting. It seeped its way into my parenting of athletes and in particular in
  the sport of distance running that has historically a very high rate of disordered
  eating and eating disorders. So a lot of different pieces. Sophia, am I missing
  anything?</p>\n<p>Sophia Bazzi (<u>04:38</u>):</p>\n<p>No, I think you’ve pretty
  much covered it. Yeah, I would say I’ve been running track in cross country since
  seventh grade. Well cross country since seventh grade. So I’ve been doing it now
  for six years. And I have kind of been coached by both of you a little bit on the
  way you’ve been very involved in the whole process, but I think it wasn’t until
  this year that you were both actually my coaches in an official capacity. So that
  has been different, but it’s been kind of a journey together for six years so far.
  Yes.</p>\n<p>Lexi Giblin (<u>05:10</u>):</p>\n<p>Something maybe I would add is
  that Kara and David are both really high achieving athletes. I mean, they were UDub
  athletes, division one athletes, and I know Kara did amazing things with running
  and your dad was an All-American. And so I wonder if we could start there and just
  hear some of how you’ve taken that in growing up. Has there been a sense of, oh,
  high expectations because I am from these two amazing athletes?</p>\n<p>Sophia Bazzi
  (<u>05:47</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah, I mean, I think as a kid I was just very, my parents
  are so impressive. It was a very sense of pride. I like telling my friends that,
  especially with my dad, that he was the record holder at UDub in the 5K and the
  10 K has been something that I always thought was so impressive, but I don’t think
  I felt necessarily a pressure to live up to that. I think it started, I was kind
  of avoidant of the sport. I didn’t want to get involved in cross country and track.
  I was not interested in it. I was very interested in other sports like soccer and
  volleyball and things like that. So I think that’s kind of how I wanted to carve
  my own path and be involved in something else. That was kind of how maybe that manifested,
  and I think I was going to be involved in volleyball more competitively.</p>\n<p>(<u>06:32</u>):</p>\n<p>That
  was my plan to go to high school, play volleyball, but then obviously COVID hit
  and I couldn’t play volleyball. So that’s kind of what got me involved more deeply
  in cross country is that was the only sport. I love sports, and that was the only
  sport it was really able to do because it’s outdoors. It was more safe I guess.
  So that’s what got me involved in that. But I think now that I’ve been involved
  in it for a while, I don’t think that there’s been, in my mind a lot of pressure
  to live up to that standard. But I think it’s just been cool to have the support
  of my parents knowing what they’ve been thorough and they’ve been competing at a
  high level. I think especially in my recruiting process, they were such a good resource
  and they just know so much. And with mom’s experience with eating disorders and
  knowing what to look out for with coaches and with the team culture, maybe red flags
  I guess of things to look at was so helpful. So I think it’s definitely been a resource
  and something I’ve been proud of versus something I felt was a sense of pressure.</p>\n<p>Kara
  Bazzi (<u>07:38</u>):</p>\n<p>Wow, that’s actually cool to hear. I didn’t know what
  you were going to say. Yeah,</p>\n<p>Lexi Giblin (<u>07:44</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah. I
  mean I can see that they are resourced and David helped my daughter Ila with the
  recruitment process and you have so much resource within your family, so I can see
  how it would be felt that way. I wonder if you would take a moment and reflect on
  your decisions around the time at which you started running. And I know in Seattle
  area, and I think across the nation, kids are doing club sport year round and traveling
  for sport at a young age year round. And I am curious what your theories are the
  way you have a thinking about that and how that impacted your decisions to either
  push or encourage or not encourage Sophia to go into something year round and hardcore
  at an early age.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>08:44</u>):</p>\n<p>So I think informed
  by both David and I as athletes and what I’ve learned in my own professional line
  of work, I was very aware of early sports specialization with athletes and cautious
  about that. I think from interestingly in the sport of distance running, there is
  some more freedom around timing. I think that there might be more pressure now in
  the changing landscape, especially of collegiate and NCAA sports, of some of the
  changes that are happening there with roster size limits. And that can leak some
  pressure down to the high school level of having to compete at a higher level in
  order to get recruited. But at the time that David and I were athletes, NCAA would
  take developing athletes so we were not, running was actually secondary sport for
  me. I was a basketball player. That was more of the dream I had for college sports.</p>\n<p>(<u>09:50</u>):</p>\n<p>And
  so I wasn’t running high mileage in high school. I didn’t feel a lot of pressure.
  My recruiting journey was very different than Sophia’s in the sense that I got recruited
  by a coach who was coaching one of my relatives. And so he took a chance on me given
  my genetic background. And David, he also didn’t get very serious about running
  until high school. So neither of us had the youth experience of being in the sport
  at a young age and we succeeded. We were very successful in college. And so we have
  a strong belief in patience and not overworking a young athlete. And then of course,
  all the knowledge I have now from my field around physiologically what youth athletes
  need from a mental health perspective. So that has been really important in our
  parenting, being patient not over-training, not finding sport environments and coaches
  along the way that share that philosophy that we don’t want to burn our kids out
  early.</p>\n<p>(<u>10:59</u>):</p>\n<p>And we do see that within the sport world,
  even in the distance running community of kids that are running higher mileage and
  really bringing some intensity early on and they’re getting results, outcome results
  for that. But we see this as a sport. We want them, both my girls, we want them
  to be able to participate for the rest of their lives if they’d like to. So we’re
  looking at the long-term, at the long-term, and in that way we’ve had protection
  over them around especially around mileage and just how are they responding to it?
  Do they still like it? It’s really important that that piece is still a part of
  their experience because that’s what also is the biggest motivator.</p>\n<p>Lexi
  Giblin (<u>11:44</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah. Sophia, what are your thoughts? Would you have
  wanted to go in more deeply into running year round or pushing harder earlier?</p>\n<p>Sophia
  Bazzi (<u>11:53</u>):</p>\n<p>Definitely not. I think I really liked having a lot
  of sports, playing a lot of sports when I was younger. And I think there’s a lot
  to be said about just doing different things, trying things out, and just the community
  aspect of that. I think honestly what got me into running was just the people and
  not the sport. And I wasn’t even that invested for the first year. I just really
  liked the people and I felt myself drawn back for that reason. And I think my love
  for the sport developed out of that. And I think I made a lot of my closest friends
  through sports as a child. So I think that specializing early would’ve limited a
  lot of that opportunity. And there’s so much time to specialize, especially with
  running, there’s not a lot of skills necessarily to learn. So I didn’t feel like
  I was at a disadvantage by only getting very serious about it once I went to high
  school. And I just think it gave me a more well-rounded perspective on sports in
  general. So I do not, I’m glad I didn’t specialize early. Okay.</p>\n<p>Lexi Giblin
  (<u>12:56</u>):</p>\n<p>Well, I love that you’re thinking about, it’s the relationships
  that mattered and sports are sort of an outgrowth of the connections you felt. Love
  that. And I feel that with in Eli’s experience as well, it’s the team that really
  is driving her interest in pushing. So I love that. What would you say has been
  both helpful and hard in the parent child interactions regarding sport?</p>\n<p>Kara
  Bazzi (<u>13:27</u>):</p>\n<p>You want me to start? Okay. I think I just start by
  talking about it through the lens of what I’ve seen clinically to start with and
  then I can share a little bit more personally clinically what I see from, especially
  through, we’ve talked about the rethinking exercise and sport process group that
  I’ve run weekly for 13 years. So I get to hear lots of stories. I get to hear a
  lot of different people’s lived experiences. And I would say some of the most challenging
  things I hear is when our clients talk about that parental pressure in sport and
  where it gets linked to achievement gets linked to worth or even when I will often
  hear that clients will say their parents made them do sports, at least be actively
  engaged. And I think there can be some tie to diet culture in that the sense of
  you have to be doing something, a sport to be moving.</p>\n<p>(<u>14:26</u>):</p>\n<p>And
  for some people that’s rooted in something really healthy. And for others that could
  be around weight management or a sense of competency because you’re involved in
  sport. So I think that I hear those stories, that’s a common pattern. And in that
  way, I think the question is who is this for? What is it that the actually want
  or need or what are their goals versus the parents’ wants or needs or goals? So
  I think that can be part of what is tricky in the parent and child interaction is
  like who wants it? Is it the parent that wants it or does the kid want it? I think
  the other challenge is managing time and schedule and all the things that come with
  sports, especially the year-round sports, the club sports on top of the high school
  sports for example, and all the time that takes and the travel that takes and figuring
  out when are they going to get nutrition.</p>\n<p>(<u>15:26</u>):</p>\n<p>And just
  the challenge of literally that scheduling aspect of it. And there’s the disparity
  around families that have the resources to do that and families that don’t. Another
  dynamic is parents over involvement or under involvement, parents that really get
  a lot of their own needs met through the sport and are highly involved. And then
  the ones that are never showing up to practices or to games or to competitions.
  And then the final dynamic I think is pretty alive is the failure piece. So kids
  like parents trying to protect their athletes or their kids from being distressed.
  And there’s a lot of distress that can come from sport, especially around performance
  and competition. And it’s just that whole dynamic with parents watching the heartbreak
  that their kids are going through and maybe wanting to help them avoid that versus
  all the lessons that can come in the hard parts.</p>\n<p>(<u>16:36</u>):</p>\n<p>So
  I think I would say those are the dynamics that are, I hear often from the clinical
  ends. And then personally, yes, all of the above. So I appreciate what Sophia said
  about pressure. I think David and I both have really, we really wanted Hannah and
  Sophia to decide what they wanted to do with their bodies, what they want to do
  with sport. We know obviously we both love the sport of running and we’re highly
  involved and gave them access to a lot of resources, but they ultimately needed
  to decide if they want it. And they get to choose every day. They get to choose
  every year if this is something they want to still be involved in. And Sophia particularly,
  I think shows she has the characteristics, in my opinion, of somebody who would
  be more drawn to working towards being a collegiate athlete, competitive, very internally
  driven.</p>\n<p>(<u>17:41</u>):</p>\n<p>And so I think that has both been very fun
  and hard. I’ll speak, my husband would his own opinions about this, but for me it’s
  been both fun and hard because I relate to her. I mean a lot of, I was very internally
  competitive as well. And so there’s a relatability between me and her in that. And
  there’s both the funness of understanding it, but then the hardness of going through
  with her and in the sense of just especially around her goals, what she wants, what
  she is hoping for, especially when we’re getting closer to that recruiting process
  and running in college, I think that is I can easily just have my empathy channel
  open. And so I felt there was a lot of feelings I was feeling alongside, but really
  wanting her to have her own experience and not just trying to strike a balance of
  being human in it as a mom, but then also letting her have her own experience. And
  for all of us parents, that’s a tough balance to hit really tough. And especially
  I think in the last two years has been particularly, again, just more salient with
  it getting closer to the college time.</p>\n<p>Sophia Bazzi (<u>19:04</u>):</p>\n<p>And
  I think I would say it’s been good in a lot of ways because you both do care a lot.
  I’d say on the spectrum of not involved to very involved. My parents are very involved
  in my sport journey, which has been great because in a lot of ways, because it’s
  a very strong support system, and I always know that they’re going to be there for
  me, they’re at every race, especially my dad being, at least my coach or the coach
  of our brother’s school is always at the meets. And mom always makes a point to
  go to all the meets. So I think it’s good to know that it’s some stability to know
  that that’s always a constant no matter how the race goes. So that’s been really
  great. But I do think it can be hard in some ways just because I know how much they
  care and I care so much as well.</p>\n<p>(<u>19:49</u>):</p>\n<p>So when things
  don’t go necessarily the way I want, I definitely have struggled with feeling like
  I’m disappointing them. And I know in some ways that that is an irrational fear
  and that they’re not disappointed by me, but because I’m disappointed in myself
  and I know how much they want me to succeed because they want me to be happy and
  to that’s what a parent wants for their kid is to succeed, even though that might
  not be the top priority. If I’m not succeeding in my mind, I feel like I get a strong
  sense of feeling like I’m disappointing them. And that’s very hard, and it can come
  with some shame or embarrassment. So it’s sometimes hard for me to separate that.
  And I would also say just because it doesn’t leave necessarily when I leave the
  track, the feelings are still there going home and things like that, it’s hard to
  separate it all. And I sometimes feel with a hard race or something that I just
  want to avoid all the feelings. And it’s hard to avoid the feelings when everyone
  has been there and knows what you experienced and wants to process with you. So
  I think that can be a little bit of a challenge.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>21:00</u>):</p>\n<p>One
  thing I would say this last track season, there’s been a lot of learning and a lot
  of different things that have been more challenging maybe around just not meeting
  some of the goals she wanted to meet. And one of the things that I feel like this
  could be good to share because it would probably be relevant to listeners, is one
  of the things that was good learning was asking Sophia how she felt. I think it
  gets easy to make assumptions of, oh no, Sophia’s going to feel X, Y, and Z after
  this race. And just trying to really suspend that and wait to see actually how she
  felt. What was her assessment, what did she feel about, how did she feel about how
  it all went? So to really try to suspend my own assumptions and not project what
  I might think she feels, but really just ask her and start with questions. And of
  course if she doesn’t want to engage in questions right away, that’s fine, but what
  was that like for you? What are you experiencing? What do you feel proud of? What
  do you feel was hard? So much better to go that direction than just assuming certain
  things about how she was going to feel about at the end of the race?</p>\n<p>(<u>22:13</u>):</p>\n<p>I
  was very intentional about that,</p>\n<p>Lexi Giblin (<u>22:16</u>):</p>\n<p>Not
  jumping to conclusions. And a lot of times, I think Kara, I think you’ve said this
  before, it’s when your kid is distressed about their sports performance, that’s
  hard as a parent, that’s very different than being distressed because of their performance.</p>\n<p>Kara
  Bazzi (<u>22:34</u>):</p>\n<p>Exactly.</p>\n<p>Lexi Giblin (<u>22:36</u>):</p>\n<p>And
  it’s sort of like you said, the empathy channel is wide open. And so that feeling,
  the feeling of what they’re feeling is more of what I connect to about it being
  hard to be a parent of an athlete. It feels like you’re out there with them because
  you’re close to them and their experience. And so I am with you that feeling of
  like, oh, she’s fine about it. Okay, great. Moving on.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>23:04</u>):</p>\n<p>Yes,
  a hundred percent. Yeah.</p>\n<p>Lexi Giblin (<u>23:07</u>):</p>\n<p>Say more about
  what it’s been like to have a parent as a coach. The good and the heart mean. So
  you’re living with your coach. What has this been like?</p>\n<p>Sophia Bazzi (<u>23:19</u>):</p>\n<p>I
  mean, I think in a lot of ways it has been good. I trust him so much, especially
  with my dad being my head track coach this year. I trust him so much. I know that
  he has my best interest at heart and that trust is already built. And with my mom
  too, being the assistant coach for cross country that they want what’s best for
  you. So it’s easy to know. I trust the race plan, I trust all that, and just to
  know that they’re always going to support me and all that is really great. But I
  think the big challenge this year has been separating the coach from the parent
  and when are we in that dynamic versus when we’re in the other dynamic? And I think
  it’s been hard to separate at home, especially with my dad. I just think we talk
  about it so much.</p>\n<p>(<u>24:07</u>):</p>\n<p>There was a time where I was like,
  this is just too much. Because we would talk about it at the track, we’d talk about
  it at home, and that was coming from me and him and my mom too. It was just hard
  to separate. So I think we really needed to work on when we were communicating about
  track and when we tried to take a step back from that and also be just a parent
  and a kid that is not completely separate from the racing and the sport. And I think
  we really worked on that and made it a lot better through only we would teams message
  on Microsoft teams about track. And then when we would text, it wouldn’t be about
  track. And when I got home, if I didn’t want to talk about track, we wouldn’t talk
  about track. It just is hard, especially when things aren’t going my way. If I had
  a tough workout or a tough race, it’s like I just need some time where I’m not a
  track athlete. And our dynamic doesn’t need to include that because it hasn’t. And
  it’s not only that. So I think that that was just an important balance to strike
  because it would get pretty overwhelming when I felt like I couldn’t escape the
  feelings of the track season and what was going on. And I just liked to have some
  separation with that.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>25:18</u>):</p>\n<p>I mean, the only
  thing I would say, I had this brief high school coaching experience in the fall
  as an assistant, and I just think the world of Sophia’s coaches that I was working
  with, I loved getting that opportunity. And I think what was cool is I’ve been around
  coaches my whole life. I’m married one, but to have, I’m going to keep going back
  to empathy, I guess, to have the actual experience of a high school coach, especially
  female high school coach, just gave me so much insight into that life and that world.
  And I love coaches. I think especially in that high school world, there’s so much
  care for these athletes, and I got to see how tough it is. The timing of practice
  for a lot of these coaches, especially female coaches, they’re leaving their family
  to go coach and they’re navigating parenting and their other job and coaching, and
  you’re putting in a ton of hours as a coach and you don’t get paid much.</p>\n<p>(<u>26:27</u>):</p>\n<p>You
  put in a ton of hours. At least in this sport, you don’t. And so the care for the
  athlete is so visible and visceral, and then I got to be a part of it, and I love
  my kids immensely. And then I just got to love the whole team. It was like my heart
  got opened to caring and loving for this whole group of people. So it was neat to
  really get to have that felt experience of what a high school coach goes through.
  And then of course, I got as a parent, then I got more access to my kids with them.
  So a lot of the coaches are leaving their families and their kids, but as a parent
  coach, you’re getting to be with your kids more. And I think we did a pretty good
  job. I checked in with the kids quite often about how I was showing up and trying
  to not try to hide the fact that I’m their mom, I am their mom. And trying to be
  also just cognizant of how do I not deny that identity, but also be a coach and
  be there for all the rest of the team and just kind of love on everybody. So I think
  I struck that balance pretty well. I dunno, Sophia, if you,</p>\n<p>Sophia Bazzi
  (<u>27:43</u>):</p>\n<p>I think you did. Yeah. Yeah. I think especially in the cross
  country season, I think the emotions are heightened in all ways when it’s like you’re
  the parent and the coach because you care deeply as a parent and you care deeply
  as a coach. So the highs are higher and the lows are lower, maybe a little bit.
  But I think we got a lot of that really good experiences I think in cross country
  especially. There was a moment when my dad’s team qualified for state for the first
  time and it was that he’s been there and it was just so exciting and we were all
  there to together and could just feel that excitement as a family. And I think that
  was really special. We’re all there together. This is now we joke, it’s like a family.
  We’re all doing this as a family coaching and all that and being the athletes. So</p>\n<p>Kara
  Bazzi (<u>28:29</u>):</p>\n<p>It was exciting. He was coaching the boys team at
  the district meet, and then I was coaching Sophia and Hannah’s team at the district
  meet, and both teams qualified for state on the same day. And it was just one of
  those,</p>\n<p>Lexi Giblin (<u>28:43</u>):</p>\n<p>I was there Pinnacle. Yeah, you
  were there. That was a moment you were there. That was a moment. Was a moment. It
  was very, one of those brings tears to your eyes even though I’m outside of it.
  It was awesome. Awesome. Okay. Kara is obviously an eating disorder treatment expert.
  And what is it like to be raised by a mom who is deeply concerned about eating disorders
  and coming from a non-diet, weight inclusive approach?</p>\n<p>Sophia Bazzi (<u>29:19</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah,
  I think it’s been great. I think that is one of the things where I’ve felt really
  supported and knowing that think in some ways it’s a healthy balance of support.
  It’s like we’re trying to support you as an athlete and a person, but nothing in
  a way that would put your body in an unhealthy position or try and force results
  through something that really isn’t going to benefit you in the long run. So I think
  it was really, it’s so great to know that my parents are teaching me to look at
  a long-term approach and approach that’s the best, that’s looking at me as a person
  before being an athlete. And I think that that’s just contributed to me feeling
  really safe and supported with my family in the sport. And I also think it’s just
  taught me to be aware, I think in the recruiting process, especially of where the
  red flags are, and just to know what I need to be expecting and what a team culture
  should be like and what is not okay. And it helped me a lot in that process. And
  also even with my high school team, just being aware of things that maybe I were
  not the most healthy. And to be able to internalize that work on talking to the
  coach and trying to make changes to the culture to support all the athletes. And
  I think that that’s been good to be able to recognize when people are saying things
  or internalizing things that maybe are not the best for them as an athlete. So</p>\n<p>Kara
  Bazzi (<u>30:55</u>):</p>\n<p>Do you want to give an example?</p>\n<p>Sophia Bazzi
  (<u>30:57</u>):</p>\n<p>Well, yeah, sure. I had a teammate a couple years ago saying
  that they had lost their period and they were like, it’s so great. I’m not bleeding
  anymore. It’s so convenient or whatever. And even the assistant coaches were like,
  that’s so great. I wish I could lose my period. That’d be so nice. Just no, not
  the hassle basically. And I kind of immediately was able to clock that as like,
  oh, that is not the best thing that that’s not going to be healthy in the long term.
  And that was something I was able to recognize, talk to my mom about and be like,
  okay. And trying to, without obviously exposing anyone or anything, talk to the
  coach and be like, Hey, I noticed this. I don’t think that this is something especially
  that the coaches should be supporting. I think that we maybe could have a conversation
  about why it’s important to have our period and just kind of raise awareness around
  that because that really concerned me for that person. I was wanting to make sure
  that she was doing what was right for her body. And also making sure that the team
  knows that isn’t maybe the right thing for anyone in the longterm. And just making
  sure that that’s not a part of the culture that we’re accepting, that we’re having
  conversations and knowing that that isn’t okay, and that we can know that we want
  better for ourselves.</p>\n<p>Lexi Giblin (<u>32:16</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah, it sounds
  like you’re a real leader around those issues, and I know you run the body image
  groove at your school. Yes, yes, I do. Yeah. Very cool. Well, tell me about a moment
  that stands out between the two of you in your sport experience</p>\n<p>Sophia Bazzi
  (<u>32:34</u>):</p>\n<p>Together. I can go first. I don’t think you’re going to
  expect this one. Maybe. I said a track race at the Easton Track race in my sophomore
  year. I honestly don’t even remember how the race really went. I just know I was
  really disappointed with it. I think I was racing the mile and I think I was in
  a good position and kind of got passed by a lot of people at the end wasn’t feeling
  the best about it. But I think what really struck me about that wasn’t the performance,
  but my reaction to it afterwards. I think I was very, very, very upset. I wanted
  to quit. That was probably the most negative, strong, negative reaction I’ve had
  to erase in my high school career, which is kind of funny to think about now because
  I’ve had so many performances that might be considered objectively worse.</p>\n<p>(<u>33:24</u>):</p>\n<p>But
  I think I’ve been able to work a lot on my mental game and how I react to things
  and just my sense of worth. But I think at that time, my sense of worth was tied
  to performance a lot more and my performance, especially before that being a freshman,
  it’s my first time really being serious with the sport. I’ve been getting better,
  better, better, better. So I think that was my first time really having to deal
  with and cope with what happens when you don’t have the performance that you want.
  And I just remember being distraught. I was so upset and I was in the car with my
  mom and we just talked for, because it was kind of far away, we had to drive home.
  We were talking for probably an hour, and I was just kind of ranting and ranting
  and ranting.</p>\n<p>(<u>34:05</u>):</p>\n<p>And I think just what stood out to
  me was just how she listened to me and really just supported me in that moment and
  didn’t try and maybe necessarily make me feel better almost just being there and
  hearing me. And I think I just really needed to get that out. And so just having
  the space to do that and just feeling safe to literally say everything I wasn’t
  holding back. I was very, very upset. And just to have that space and then just
  to say the things that you just said, the right things, just saying the things that
  made me feel better and knowing, giving the perspective of this is not life or death.
  You are not defined by your performance. You’re not defined by your identity as
  an athlete and you’re like a person first. And that I think really helped me start
  the journey of working on my perspective as an athlete and my mental game and knowing
  that my performances don’t define me. And I think that sticks out in my mind as
  one of the starting points for that. And that wouldn’t have been possible if there
  wasn’t someone who was willing to just listen to me. And also because she has been
  through all of that, I think it just gives it more credibility in some ways. I was
  like, okay, if you can do it, I can do it. It’s just having that support from someone
  who’s been through that in the same sport that just really felt special. So</p>\n<p>Kara
  Bazzi (<u>35:30</u>):</p>\n<p>Oh, it’s really sweet. So I remember that car ride.
  I do. And it’s cool to hear you name that as the most meaningful moment because
  it was kind of more of your original moment of really kind of having to navigate
  that because we’ve navigated more of those moments this last track season, your
  senior year. So it’s neat to hear that one was more poignant. It was more of where
  it really, that work opened up for you.</p>\n<p>Sophia Bazzi (<u>35:59</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah,
  because had a lot of experiences this year that have been very hard performances,
  but I think I’ve been able to handle it a lot better. It doesn’t get me down in
  the same way that it used to. So I think that that has been really cool to see of,
  yes, you can have bad performances, but it’s not going to hit me the same way anymore.
  And that was a lot of what makes me feel a lot more secure going into college and
  not knowing, I mean, I didn’t end my season on a good note at all, but I feel a
  lot of hope for the future, and I’m not super worried because I think I can handle
  it and I know what is really important to me, and it’s not necessarily just the
  performance anymore. So</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>36:43</u>):</p>\n<p>Cool. My gosh.
  Wow, that’s so awesome too, because here you go, growth from a generational growth.
  My collegiate experience was my worth was, I mean, this is what she’s saying about
  how I could understand my worth was tied in my performance, and I remember crying
  after every poor performance and I didn’t approach performances. You have this past
  track season, so it’s just so cool to see the development you’ve had and get to
  see how you’re now doing something very different from me. It’s really awesome.
  My gosh. Okay, well, my meaningful story moment, I’m taking that,</p>\n<p>Lexi Giblin
  (<u>37:25</u>):</p>\n<p>Is it right now? Maybe.</p>\n<p>Kara Bazzi (<u>37:26</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah,
  maybe. That is amazing. Sophia. Oh my gosh. Sometimes I’m like, wow, you’re so much
  more mature than me. I love it. You’re so awesome. But I had a really meaningful
  sport moment this track season, and maybe this is the recency bias because this
  is so recent, but Sophia has had an up and down season this track season in terms
  of performance. In terms of performance and the things that she’s, these responses
  and how she’s shown up have just blown me away. So this is another moment that actually
  Lexi was present for. So in our league, for those that don’t, I dunno, for different
  people listening from different sports, it was kind of our postseason experience
  of metro’s district and state. So this is the metro meet, qualifying meet for districts,
  and Sophia was coming into this sick, she had something happened over spring break
  and it kind of turned into this respiratory thing.</p>\n<p>(<u>38:34</u>):</p>\n<p>Horrible,
  horrible, horrible cough and just feeling really bad physically, really, really
  bad physically and track is a vulnerable sport for any of you that have done it.
  It’s very, you’re on display, you’re going around this oval track and everyone’s
  watching you, and she’s not feeling her best. She’s a senior, this is her senior
  season, everyone knows her. She’s on display and here she’s feeling vulnerable,
  sick, kind of awful, and not sure what her body’s going to do. And I think a little
  bit more scared of, is my body going to betray me in this race? And she had a doctor’s
  note to be ready to scratch her out of the meat if she needed to out of this race.
  And I remember being tearful as I’m seeing her on the infield, I don’t have much
  access because she’s on the infield warming up, and I’m not sure if she’s going
  to scratch till the very end.</p>\n<p>(<u>39:36</u>):</p>\n<p>And I’m tearful just
  like the vulnerability of her having to be out there and that decision. And then
  I see that she decides to race, and I think I was crying the entire race, Lexi,
  right, of the brave bravery of, and we will have maybe something to say this next
  question too, but the bravery in that moment of going out there and the vulnerable
  just showing up to being in this very vulnerable thing. And I just felt so connected
  to her and I connected because of vulnerable, I think of R-O-D-B-T. It was like
  a vulnerable decision, and that made me feel so connected to her no matter what
  her outcome was going to be in that race, it didn’t matter. It’s like she did something
  vulnerable and she did it in front of her community. And I had Lexi by my side,
  her coaches that just care deeply about her as a human being. I mean, the sense
  of closeness of my girl is a brave girl was just really meaningful. And then getting
  to celebrate that with her, again, not the outcome of the race, but just kind of
  recognizing what it means to show up to the line and what it means to be in this
  sport. It is an intimidating, vulnerable sport.</p>\n<p>Sophia Bazzi (<u>41:07</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah,
  I think showing up this year was especially hard because of all the, I was not feeling
  well for a long time and I would feel pretty sick or very fatigued going into most
  of my races. And I think we’ve been to some talks recently, some sports talks, me
  and my mom. And I think one of the things that really stood out to me is the most
  brave thing to do is just getting to the start line. It’s not even your result,
  how you finish, but it’s just not, the start line is more impressive than the finish
  line in some ways because it can be sometimes you’re overcoming a lot just to even
  get there. And it is very vulnerable to put yourself out there even knowing that
  you might not have the performance that you want. So that’s been</p>\n<p>Lexi Giblin
  (<u>41:49</u>):</p>\n<p>Cool. Yeah, what a special moment. And it was, I mean, just
  to watch you Sophia, but then to watch your mom connect to you about that and that
  moment was really beautiful and for all these reasons of bravery. Yeah. Yeah. What
  about heartbreaking moments this season?</p>\n<p>Sophia Bazzi (<u>42:12</u>):</p>\n<p>I
  can go first. Yeah. I think the most heartbreaking moment this season was the district
  smile that I raced in. And that was the first race that I dropped out of ever. And
  I think that was really hard for me in a lot of ways because I had always told myself,
  I’ll never drop out of a race. That is one thing I can control. I’m not going to
  let myself quit. It felt like quitting, and I really don’t like that as an idea.
  I always want to do my best and always stick it out. But I think that that was a
  really big learning experience for me because I had felt so terrible going into
  that. And that was more of a mental thing. I was dealing with a lot. There was a
  lot going on. I was going through all my graduation things. It was the most stressful
  weekend that I’ve had in a really long time, and I just felt really trapped and
  really panicked, and I was like, I don’t know what I’m doing here.</p>\n<p>(<u>43:03</u>):</p>\n<p>I
  don’t want to do this. I felt like I was being forced into it almost, which is funny
  because no one was forcing me to do it, but by myself almost. And I was just in
  that race and I was like, this is not serving me. I am not, there’s not nothing
  good is coming out of this for me. And I just made the decision to step off the
  track. I wasn’t injured per se, so it wasn’t like it was necessary, but I just stepped
  off the track and I felt really, really, really disappointed with myself. I think
  that was the most disappointed with myself that I had felt in a while because I’d
  always told myself I would finish and I felt like I was breaking a promise to myself
  or something like that. But I think that what stood out to me after that with more
  perspective is just that is also a brave decision in its own way to step off and
  not finish a race.</p>\n<p>(<u>43:56</u>):</p>\n<p>And I think that I was making
  a decision that I needed to make in that moment because I was so, I just needed
  to know that I had some autonomy in that situation to make the own decision and
  to make a decision that benefited me as a person and not maybe as a competitor necessarily.
  And just to make space for myself when I need it. And yeah, that was a moment where
  I treated myself as a person who had a need to take a break versus an athlete who
  needed to make it to state. So I think that that was powerful in its own way. And
  I don’t want to drop out of many races in the future. I think that’s still something
  that I’m really going to work on not doing. But I think in that moment it made sense
  for me and I was able to accept that. And I think that was just powerful because
  I didn’t think I would be able to accept a decision like that in the past.</p>\n<p>Kara
  Bazzi (<u>44:49</u>):</p>\n<p>Yeah. Wow. I mean, that was a moment. That’s my same
  answer for that one. It was learning for our family. I think public learning for,
  honestly, this sounds maybe dramatic, but for the running community, you choosing
  that and if people have the opportunity to hear that from you is a really powerful
  decision you made. I’m tearing up right now. It’s a very powerful decision because
  you can choose autonomy. You’re not forced into this. And so many athletes have
  these rules, I have to do this, or at least control the controllables. I will finish
  this thing even if my performance is bad. And I think it wasn’t out of pride. It
  was a decision that you were making for your mental wellness and what was best for
  you as a person. And if people and listeners can know that, I just think that, again,
  it opens up the door for whole person athlete decisions. It makes me think of, I
  mean, I know you’re not in the level of Simone Biles, but it makes me think of what
  Simone Biles did too, of choosing not to go into that competition in the Olympics.
  That there is some ways of choosing no, that is coming from bravery and not from
  fear, from shame.</p>\n<p>Lexi Giblin (<u>46:23</u>):</p>\n<p>That’s beautiful.
  One last question. Where are you running next year?</p>\n<p>Sophia Bazzi (<u>46:29</u>):</p>\n<p>I’m
  running at Gonzaga.</p>\n<p>Lexi Giblin (<u>46:31</u>):</p>\n<p>All right, go. Zs</p>\n<p>Sophia
  Bazzi (<u>46:33</u>):</p>\n<p>GOs.</p>\n<p>Lexi Giblin (<u>46:36</u>):</p>\n<p>Thank

A recent episode of "The Appetite" podcast features a conversation between Kara Bazzi, an experienced athlete and mother, and her daughter Sophia, a soon-to-be collegiate athlete. They reflect on their journey through high school sports, focusing on the complexities of parenting a competitive athlete. Kara shares insights from her history of eating disorder recovery and how it influences her parenting. 

Sophia discusses her transition from various sports to specializing in cross country and track, highlighting the positive impact of supportive family dynamics and the importance of community in sports. Both emphasize the significance of allowing young athletes to explore their interests without the pressure of early specialization. 

The conversation touches on challenges like parental expectations, managing schedules, and the emotional toll of competition. Kara and Sophia agree on the value of open communication about feelings after races and the need for understanding each other's perspectives. They conclude that while involvement in sports can be rewarding, it can also lead to feelings of disappointment and pressure. Ultimately, they advocate for a balanced approach to athletics that prioritizes mental health and personal fulfillment.
