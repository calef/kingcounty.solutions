title: 'August Safety Update: Rethinking the Go-Around'
topics: []
---

This month's safety update from Angel Flight West focuses on the critical decision-making process surrounding go-arounds during landing. Go-arounds may be necessary due to unstable approaches, runway obstructions, loss of visual reference, mechanical issues, wind shear, or ATC instructions. Early recognition of potential landing issues, preferably by 500 feet AGL, is emphasized to ensure safety. A proper briefing and consistent practice of go-around procedures are crucial, as they help mitigate the startle effect that can occur during unexpected situations. 

The article also addresses the stigma associated with go-arounds, framing them as a "decision of a sure loss" compared to the uncertain outcomes of attempting a landing. Choosing to go around may feel like admitting failure, but it is, in fact, a demonstration of good judgment and situational awareness. Ultimately, pilots are encouraged to view go-arounds as essential tools in their flying repertoire, reinforcing that a safe landing begins with a safe approach, which sometimes means recognizing when not to land.
