  <p data-start="725" data-end="1081">“Too many of our families are living in fear — fear of deportation, separation, and being targeted for who they are,” said Yamaguchi. “That’s why ACRS is expanding our advocacy and services, including the relaunch of our Legal Clinic, to ensure no one faces those challenges alone. <em data-start="1367" data-end="1386">Not on our watch.</em>”</p>

The Legal Clinic’s return marks a renewed investment in providing accessible, culturally responsive support to those most in need.</p>
  <p data-start="1877" data-end="2291">The gala opened with an electrifying performance by <strong data-start="1929" data-end="1952">Seattle Kokon Taiko</strong>, whose thunderous drumming set an atmosphere of strength and solidarity.

  <p data-start="2923" data-end="3135">“If something like ACRS had existed for my grandmother, everything could have been different,” Hulls said. “Care requires connection, and connection cannot happen without people who have the lived experience and the language to understand your story.”</p>
  <p data-start="2923" data-end="3135">The program also paid tribute to two beloved members of the ACRS family.

  members, advocates, and supporters gathered for the **Asian Counseling and Referral
  Service (ACRS)** Annual Benefit Gala on **October 4** at the **Hyatt Regency Bellevue**
  , coming together under the theme _“Not on Our Watch.”_\n\nThe evening was filled
  with powerful performances, moving stories, and a collective spirit of resilience
  — culminating in an address by **ACRS’s new CEO, Kendee Yamaguchi** , who announced
  the **relaunch of ACRS’s Legal Clinic** this fall in partnership with the **Asian
  Bar Association of Washington (ABAW)** and the **King County Bar Association (KCBA)**.\n\n[![](https://acrs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/acrs-gala25-highlights-20-200x300.jpg)](https://acrs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/acrs-gala25-highlights-20.jpg)\n\nACRS
  CEO Kendee Yamaguchi affirmed ACRS’s unwavering commitment to equity, justice, and
  community care. Photo credit: Charissa Soriano\n\n“Too many of our families are
  living in fear — fear of deportation, separation, and being targeted for who they
  are,” said Yamaguchi. “That’s why ACRS is expanding our advocacy and services, including
  the relaunch of our Legal Clinic, to ensure no one faces those challenges alone.
  _Not on our watch._”\n\n“Bringing this clinic back reminds us — and everyone watching
  — that no matter what obstacles come our way, we will meet the need.”\n\nIn her
  first major public speech since stepping into the role earlier this year, Yamaguchi’s
  message captured both courage and continuity, affirming ACRS’s unwavering commitment
  to equity, justice, and community care. The Legal Clinic’s return marks a renewed
  investment in providing accessible, culturally responsive support to those most
  in need.\n\nThe gala opened with an electrifying performance by **Seattle Kokon
  Taiko** , whose thunderous drumming set an atmosphere of strength and solidarity.
  Later in the evening, the program concluded with a performance by the internationally
  renowned **Massive Monkees** , the award-winning breakdance crew from Seattle’s
  Beacon Hill, who brought their high-energy celebrating culture and community.\n\nAmong
  the night’s speakers was **Shomya Tripathy** , ACRS’s Policy and Civic Engagement
  Director, who spoke about the power of collective advocacy in protecting the rights
  of immigrant and refugee families.\n\nThe evening’s featured guest speaker, **Tessa
  Hulls** — artist, writer, and _Pulitzer Prize–winning author_ of _Feeding Ghosts_
  — delivered a deeply moving multimedia presentation about her family’s history and
  their multigenerational journey through trauma, mental illness, and healing. Her
  reflections on the power of community and belonging mirrored ACRS’s mission to provide
  culturally responsive care and connection.\n\n[![](https://acrs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/acrs-gala25-highlights-21-200x300.jpg)](https://acrs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/acrs-gala25-highlights-21.jpg)\n\nThe

  also invited to view Hulls’s original artwork in the foyer, featuring portraits
  of **ACRS Club Bamboo** clients — a tribute to the elders whose stories of resilience
  continue to inspire the community.\n\n“If something like ACRS had existed for my
  grandmother, everything could have been different,” Hulls said. “Care requires connection,
  and connection cannot happen without people who have the lived experience and the
