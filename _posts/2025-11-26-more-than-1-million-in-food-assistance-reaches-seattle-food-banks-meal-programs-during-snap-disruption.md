More than $1 million in emergency food assistance has been allocated to Seattle food banks and meal programs due to the disruption of SNAP benefits on November 1 amid a federal shutdown. Mayor Bruce Harrell declared a limited civil emergency, allowing the city to provide $1 million weekly to agencies responding to the increased demand for food. This funding enabled numerous food banks, meal programs, and school-based food distribution efforts to quickly address the needs of vulnerable communities. In the first week of the emergency, food banks reported a 21% increase in demand, with some organizations seeing a surge of first-time visitors.

The Seattle Public Schools partnered with local organizations to distribute 8,800 food boxes to families. Food providers like the West Seattle Food Bank and Asian Counseling and Referral Service utilized the funds to stock culturally relevant food items, responding to a significant rise in visitors. Even after the emergency period concluded on November 22, food assistance remains a crucial part of Seattle's safety net, with ongoing efforts to support families in need as the holiday season approaches.
