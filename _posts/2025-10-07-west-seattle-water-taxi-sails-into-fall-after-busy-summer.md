The West Seattle Water Taxi is set to shift to its fall/winter schedule following a record summer, transporting over 178,000 passengers from June to August—the highest since 2019. The summer season included extended weekend services and special sailings, contributing to this surge in ridership. Notable events, including Seattle Mariners games and the 2025 FIFA Men’s Club World Cup, also encouraged usage, along with a series of concerts. The water taxi, which offers a scenic 15-minute ride across Elliott Bay, will cease late-night sailings starting October 11, with weekday departures from Pier 50 scheduled from 5:55 a.m. to 7:05 p.m. and weekend schedules running from 8:30 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Passengers can utilize free Metro water taxi shuttles to access various locations, including the West Seattle Junction. The adult fare to West Seattle is $6.25, with discounts for ORCA card holders. Young riders aged 18 and under can travel for free. The water taxi will not operate on Thanksgiving, Christmas, or New Year’s Day. Additionally, the Vashon Water Taxi will begin its six-day service on the same date.
