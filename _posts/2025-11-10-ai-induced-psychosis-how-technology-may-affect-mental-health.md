AI-induced psychosis refers to a phenomenon where excessive interactions with artificial intelligence (AI), such as chatbots, lead to distorted thinking or detachment from reality. This emerging issue has been noted particularly among individuals with pre-existing mental health conditions. Symptoms may include strongly held false beliefs about AI, such as seeing it as a god-like entity or believing it has special insights into reality. Factors contributing to this condition include the constant availability of AI, emotional attachment to chatbots, and existing vulnerabilities in users. The ease of engaging with AI can lead to compulsive use, further blurring the lines between reality and AI-generated interactions.

Strategies to mitigate the risk of AI psychosis include setting boundaries for technology use, prioritizing real-life interactions, and practicing mindfulness to maintain self-awareness. It is crucial to seek professional help if AI usage negatively impacts mental health, sleep, or relationships. While AI can aid in everyday tasks, it is not a substitute for human therapists, who provide essential emotional support and grounding. Awareness and regulatory measures are necessary as the intersection of AI technology and mental health continues to evolve.
