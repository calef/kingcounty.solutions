The U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey has terminated the consent decree in United States v. City of Newark, concluding a nine-year reform initiative for the Newark Police Department (NPD). This action follows the NPD's implementation of constitutional policing reforms addressing issues such as unjustified stops, excessive force, and biased policing, which were identified in a 2011 investigation by the Department of Justice. The consent decree was established in 2016 to resolve these findings, and the NPD has worked to meet its requirements over the years. Assistant Attorney General Harmeet K. Dhillon expressed pride in the NPD and emphasized the importance of effective, constitutional policing in Newark. Acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba highlighted significant improvements in community trust and law enforcement practices. The court previously allowed the termination of some decree requirements in 2024, signaling progress in the NPD's reforms. The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey managed the investigation and litigation throughout the process.
