Maple Valley Food Bank is preparing for its 2025 Backpack Program, which assists families with school supplies before the academic year begins. Registration runs from July 8 to July 30, 2025, during market hours: Tuesdays from 10:30 AM to 6 PM and Wednesdays from 10:30 AM to 1 PM. To be eligible, participants must be active clients of the food bank, residing in Maple Valley, Selleck, or within the Tahoma School District, and have school-aged children (K-12) living in their household. Documentation is required for children enrolled in the Tahoma School District, and proof of address and ID for all children must be provided. 

Families outside the Maple Valley Food Bank's service area can contact local food banks or school districts for similar programs. For questions, individuals can call or text 425-432-8633 or email Allie at allie@maplevalleyfoodbank.org. Additional resources include food banks and school districts in Black Diamond, Kent, Covington, Auburn, Issaquah, and Renton, providing various support options for those in need.
