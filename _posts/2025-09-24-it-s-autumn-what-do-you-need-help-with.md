As autumn arrives, many people face challenges related to food security, housing, and financial stability. The United Way of King County provides year-round resources to assist those in need. Their website serves as a comprehensive resource for individuals seeking help with food, housing, healthcare, employment, and counseling. For immediate assistance, individuals can call 2-1-1, a free and confidential service that connects them to local support. 

For those facing eviction, the Housing Justice Project offers free legal assistance for low-income renters in King County. Young people under 24 can access specialized resources, including the Youth Diversion Infrastructure Project, which supports those in foster care or juvenile systems. 

The organization also aids families with young children through programs like ParentChild+ and collaborates with community partners to provide services for children aged 2 to 4. College students can benefit from the Bridge to Finish program, which offers resources across ten campuses, including food access and financial assistance. Additionally, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) can help individuals obtain healthy food through monthly benefits. The United Way encourages regular visits to their website for updated information and resources.
