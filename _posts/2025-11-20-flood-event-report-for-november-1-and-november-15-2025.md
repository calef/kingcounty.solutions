  <p>A river facility refers to any man-made or engineered structure that interacts with a river system, with the purpose of influencing or controlling water flow, particularly to reduce flood risks. These include levees and revetments. A levee is a natural or artificial river embankment that prevents flooding, and a revetment is a passive structure that protects against erosion caused by river currents and high flows.</p>

  <p>The King County Flood Control District (KCFCD) was created to provide funding and policy oversight for flood risk reduction capital projects and programs in King County. The KCFCD brings a comprehensive approach to flood management and provides funding to improve King County’s aging and inadequate flood protection facilities, including flood control facilities, capital improvement projects, and floodplain management and restoration programs. Funding is also provided for a regional flood warning center and emergency response, flood facility maintenance, public education and outreach, mapping and technical studies, citizen inquiry, and public response.</p>

  ## Infrastructure and Critical Facilities for November 1, 2025

  _This section assesses the impact of flooding on critical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, utilities, and public facilities, and it highlights past investments which may have mitigated the impact of this flood event. It is not intended to be an all-inclusive list of flooding impacts, nor does it highlight all past government investment in area flood mitigation infrastructure._

  The following roads were at risk for closure during this flood event:

  - Neal Road Southeast
  - Reinig Road
  - West Snoqualmie River Road Northeast (Walker Road)
  - Snoqualmie Meadowbrook Road
  - Mill Pond Road

  The following images are associated with areas where river facilities exist. You can learn more about locations of river facilities, floodplains, and other important flood related information by using King County’s [iMap](https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/kcit/data-information-services/gis-center/maps-apps/imap).

  A river facility refers to any man-made or engineered structure that interacts with a river system, with the purpose of influencing or controlling water flow, particularly to reduce flood risks. These include levees and revetments. A levee is a natural or artificial river embankment that prevents flooding, and a revetment is a passive structure that protects against erosion caused by river currents and high flows.

  - Existing flood risk reduction infrastructure appeared to function as designed given flooding impacts were minimal.
  - Media outreach and coverage appeared to function as intended to help keep the public properly informed and minimize public risks.
  - Flooding, while minor, underscores the policy position supporting the need for further investment in flood mitigation planning and projects.

  ## Recognitions

  The King County Flood Control District (KCFCD) was created to provide funding and policy oversight for flood risk reduction capital projects and programs in King County. The KCFCD brings a comprehensive approach to flood management and provides funding to improve King County’s aging and inadequate flood protection facilities, including flood control facilities, capital improvement projects, and floodplain management and restoration programs. Funding is also provided for a regional flood warning center and emergency response, flood facility maintenance, public education and outreach, mapping and technical studies, citizen inquiry, and public response.

  During flood events, however, it is the KCFCD’s governmental partners at King County and the other urban and rural cities throughout the county who are responsible for emergency services, transportation, public works, housing, and other government services critical for the protection of life and property.

  The KCFCD would like to recognize and show appreciation for the dedicated public services provided by those who work at National Weather Service, King County, and at cities throughout the county. These talented professionals work long hours during flood events, occasionally at risk to their own safety, to ensure the best possible outcomes for the citizens of King County.

This report by the King County Flood Control District analyzes two significant flood events that impacted the Snoqualmie River Basin on November 1 and November 15, 2025.

The South Fork Skykomish River also entered Flood Phase 1 that day, peaking at 8,910 cfs. The Flood Warning Center was activated to manage the situation.

The second event on November 15 saw the Snoqualmie River and Tolt River again reach Flood Phase 1, with peak flows of 17,800 cfs and 3,610 cfs, respectively, on that day. The South Fork Skykomish River fluctuated between phases due to variable rainfall. The Flood Warning Center operated throughout both events, providing updates and managing communications with the public and officials. The report concludes with an assessment of infrastructure impacts and highlights the lessons learned from the floods, emphasizing the importance of preparation and response measures in mitigating flood risks.
