On April 24, Congresswoman Suzan DelBene hosted a housing roundtable at August Wilson Place, a 57-unit affordable housing community in Bellevue, which includes units for veterans. The event aimed to address the critical shortage of affordable housing in the U.S., particularly in Washington, where over 250,000 households pay more than half their income on rent. August Wilson Place was developed using the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) program, a key tool for creating affordable housing nationwide. DelBene introduced bipartisan legislation to build or restore 1.6 million affordable homes across the country, including 53,000 units in Washington. She emphasized the importance of safe, affordable housing for family well-being and the necessity of expanding the Housing Credit to tackle the housing crisis effectively. Bellevue Mayor Lynne Robinson highlighted LIHTC as the most significant source of financing for affordable housing in the area, advocating for its expansion through the Affordable Housing Credit Improvement Act to increase housing opportunities for families, seniors, and low-wage workers.
