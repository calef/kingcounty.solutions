  Summer is in full swing at the King County Library System, with enthusiastic patrons of all ages checking out books and adding to their Summer Reading logs.

  How do we know this? For one thing, there has been a 250% increase in the usage of our 24/7 lockers when compared to the same period last year. The convenient lockers, initially installed to allow holds pick-ups outdoors while libraries were closed due to COVID, have since grown in popularity. Patrons so far this year have checked out 7,796 items at Kirkland Library lockers; 7,450 items at Bothell Library’s lockers; 6,633 at Covington; 4,425 at Woodinville and 3,053 items at Federal Way 320th Library. Lockers installed late last year outside Normandy Park City Hall but operated by KCLS, have notched 2,280 checkouts. The total number of locker checkouts is 31,637 checkouts, versus 27,774 at the same time last year.

  While KCLS is known as the third-ranking library system in the world for digital checkouts according to the platform Overdrive, our data shows that patrons love both digital and print books equally. We also know that more patrons are tracking their reading minutes. Summer Reading runs through August 31, and as of August 1, there have been 4,319 total finishers, including 3,838 first-time finishers and 481 repeat finishers. A further reward: Every library has a community board with the names of finishers displayed throughout the summer.&nbsp;

  Reading is important and fun, but growing research also shows it is healthy. The benefits of “escaping” into a good book are being touted by the Washington Library Association (WLA) in an upcoming “[Bibliotherapy in Libraries Summit](https://www.wla.org/wla-bibliotherapy-summit).” Bibliotherapy refers to the use of reading for therapeutic purposes, and KCLS librarians know well how stories can transform, empower and positively impact the well-being of individuals and communities.

  Remember that audiobooks and reading to others counts toward Summer Reading minutes read. Explore our staff’s [reading recommendations](https://kcls.org/explore/?tag=summer&sort=featured) for all ages; our collection is full of books that will entertain and inspire you. Youth Summer Reading participants also can get free Seattle Storm tickets through a KCLS-Storm partnership, while supplies last. Check [www.kcls.org/summer](http://www.kcls.org/summer).

  Many of our libraries are adjacent to or near parks, so bring a book, a blanket and even a picnic, and join us for [Summer Reading in the Park](https://kcls.bibliocommons.com/v2/events?q=Summer%20Reading%20in%20the%20Park).

  Our [Summer Meals](https://kcls.bibliocommons.com/v2/events?q=Summer%20Meals&page=1) program runs through August 30 at three libraries: Kingsgate, Shoreline and Valley View. The annual program, a partnership with the KCLS Foundation, YMCA and other organizations, provides nutrition for body and mind. You can enjoy a free, healthy lunch and a chance to read books of your choice. Last year, 3,899 meals were served at more than 199 Summer Meal events.

  In other news, KCLS’ [Author Voices](https://kcls.org/authorvoices/) series continues this month, with New York Times best-selling author Emiko Jean discussing her new novel, **_The Return of Ellie Black_** August 6. Local writer and public historian Timiko Nimura will moderate the online event, being held 7:30-8:30pm.

  Other summer opportunities include the Mobile Services Bookmobile, which will visit fairs, festivals, block parties and farmer’s markets across King County this month. See the [Bookmobile](https://kcls.org/news/bookmobile-schedule/) events schedule.
