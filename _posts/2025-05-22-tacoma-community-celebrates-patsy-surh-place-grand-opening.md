On May 21st, the Tacoma Lincoln District community celebrated the grand opening of Patsy Surh Place, an affordable housing community for seniors aged 55 and over. This six-story building, located at 3740 South G Street, aims to provide a culturally inclusive environment for Asian Pacific Islander elders and other low-income seniors. Named after Patsy Surh O’Connell, a prominent community leader and APCC founder, the development symbolizes her dedication to promoting Asian Pacific heritage and culture. The building features 77 units and amenities such as a community lounge, multipurpose room, gallery space, outdoor courtyard, and on-site laundry facilities. 

Key speakers, including Tacoma Mayor Victoria Woodards and Lieutenant Governor Denny Heck, praised O’Connell's contributions and the importance of affordable housing. The project was supported by various organizations and funding sources, including Pierce County, the City of Tacoma, and the State Housing Trust Fund. Lua Pritchard, APCC’s executive director, emphasized the community's commitment to caring for its elders and fostering intergenerational connections. Patsy Surh Place is designed to be a model for affordable senior housing, enriching the lives of its residents and the broader community.
