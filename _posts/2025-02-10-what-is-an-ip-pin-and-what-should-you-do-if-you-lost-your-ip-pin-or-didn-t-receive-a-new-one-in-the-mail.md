The IRS identity protection PIN (IP PIN) is a 6-digit number assigned to eligible taxpayers to prevent misuse of their Social Security number on fraudulent tax returns. Taxpayers confirmed as victims of tax-related identity theft receive a new IP PIN each year via a CP01A Notice. Those without an IP PIN can obtain one proactively to guard against identity theft. Anyone with a Social Security Number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number can apply, including individuals living abroad. IP PINs are required when filing Forms 1040, 1040-NR, 1040-PR, 1040-SR, and 1040-SS.

If you lose your IP PIN or do not receive a new one, you must retrieve it before e-filing your tax return. You can use your Online Account on IRS.gov for this purpose, where you will need to validate your identity. If online retrieval is not possible, contact the IRS at 800-908-4490 for assistance. An IRS representative will verify your identity and mail your IP PIN to your registered address within 21 days.
