Every morning, 3-year-old Sai’chaun eagerly checks on his friends Bobby and Laila, reflecting the close-knit bond between their families at Solid Ground’s Sand Point Housing. Sharing a front porch, the families navigate life together, with their children inseparable and engaging in daily activities like meals and play. Both mothers, Heaven McDowell and Lashaye “Shay” Perkins, have faced significant challenges, including trauma and loss, leading them to rely on each other as single parents. Heaven returned to Sand Point after personal tragedies, while Shay sought refuge after escaping an abusive relationship. Their mutual support has become vital; they look after each other’s children and provide emotional support during tough times. Shay helped Heaven through a severe depression, demonstrating the strength of their community bonds. Solid Ground fosters this supportive environment through shared meals and activities, emphasizing the importance of community in recovery from homelessness. The friendships formed at Sand Point create a family-like atmosphere, providing essential emotional and practical support as the residents build new lives together.
