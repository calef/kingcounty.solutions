Every August, Bellevue students prepare to return to school, but for many from low-income households, this time can be stressful due to concerns about ill-fitting hand-me-downs and insufficient clothing. The Bellevue LifeSpring Clothes-4-Kids™ program addresses this issue by providing students with gift cards to purchase new clothing that fits their style and needs, fostering a sense of dignity and confidence. Program Manager Lucy Garcia emphasizes the importance of choice in building self-worth and self-expression. This year, over 2,000 students benefitted from the program, enabling them to return to school feeling comfortable and confident. Unlike typical back-to-school programs that focus solely on essentials, Clothes-4-Kids prioritizes the desires of students, allowing them to choose new items that reflect their personality. Program Director Rahima Somji highlights that this act of choice empowers children and helps them feel valued. Feedback from families illustrates the positive impact, with one parent sharing their child’s excitement over new clothing. The program not only meets a basic need but also helps children feel like they belong, enhancing their confidence in the classroom and beyond. Together, the community is ensuring that every Bellevue child can thrive as they start the new school year.
