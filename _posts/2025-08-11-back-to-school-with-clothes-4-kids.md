  <p><strong>Every August, students across Bellevue get ready to return to the classroom</strong>—some with nervous energy, others with excitement, and all with hopes of starting the school year on the right foot.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>But for thousands of Bellevue children from low-income households, this time of year can be a source of stress. Feelings of anxiety often overshadow the excitement of back-to-school shopping when kids worry about hand-me-down&nbsp;clothes that don&#8217;t fit right, or a lack of weather-appropriate clothing.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>That&#8217;s where the Bellevue LifeSpring Clothes-4-Kids<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/16.0.1/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> program steps in. Powered by community investments, the program provides students with gift cards to shop for new back-to-school clothing that fits their size, style, and personality, offering not just essentials, but a sense of dignity and confidence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p><strong>Clothing is a basic need that, when met, helps set the foundation for children to live to their fullest potential.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



  <p><em>&#8220;When students can choose clothing that fits their size, style, and personality, they&#8217;re empowered to show up as themselves,&#8221; shared Program Manager Lucy Garcia. &#8220;Choice is central to our Clothes-4-Kids program because it helps build self-worth and allows students to express who they are.&#8221;</em>  </p>



  <p>This year, with the support of our compassionate community, more than <strong>2,000 Bellevue students </strong>received support from the program and the opportunity to return to school feeling confident and comfortable in their own style.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p><em>&#8220;Most back-to-school programs focus on the basics—backpacks, notebooks, and pencils—but often overlook the student&#8217;s wants,&#8221; explained Program Director Rahima Somji. &#8220;Often, families from low-income households rely on secondhand stores or hand-me-downs. Our program offers something different: the experience of choosing something brand new that reflects their personality and style. That simple moment of choice sends a powerful message: you matter, and your voice counts. For families who are often navigating limited options, this moment of choice becomes an act of empowerment and can make a big difference in how a child shows up at school—and in the world.&#8221;&nbsp;</em></p>



  <p>That impact is clear in the feedback and kind words from families. One parent shared:&nbsp;</p>



  <p><em>&#8220;I am so grateful and at a loss for words to describe my daughter&#8217;s expression of enthusiasm and excitement when she picked out her items. She loved them! Especially the purple and pink shoes. I am sure they will be very helpful in rainy and winter times.&#8221; </em></p>

Every August, Bellevue students prepare to return to school, but for many from low-income households, this time can be stressful due to concerns about ill-fitting hand-me-downs and insufficient clothing. The Bellevue LifeSpring Clothes-4-Kids™ program addresses this issue by providing students with gift cards to purchase new clothing that fits their style and needs, fostering a sense of dignity and confidence. Program Manager Lucy Garcia emphasizes the importance of choice in building self-worth and self-expression. This year, over 2,000 students benefitted from the program, enabling them to return to school feeling comfortable and confident. Unlike typical back-to-school programs that focus solely on essentials, Clothes-4-Kids prioritizes the desires of students, allowing them to choose new items that reflect their personality. Program Director Rahima Somji highlights that this act of choice empowers children and helps them feel valued. Feedback from families illustrates the positive impact, with one parent sharing their child’s excitement over new clothing. The program not only meets a basic need but also helps children feel like they belong, enhancing their confidence in the classroom and beyond. Together, the community is ensuring that every Bellevue child can thrive as they start the new school year.
