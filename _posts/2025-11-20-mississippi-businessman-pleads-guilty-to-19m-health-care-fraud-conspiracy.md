A Mississippi businessman, Willie De Gibbs, has pleaded guilty to a $19 million health care fraud conspiracy involving Medicare. De Gibbs, 53, owned three durable medical equipment (DME) supply companies and controlled four others, sometimes using straw owners. He was involved in a scheme that defrauded Medicare by paying kickbacks for fraudulent doctors' orders and subsequently billing the government for medically unnecessary orthotic braces for beneficiaries who neither requested nor needed them. De Gibbs faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and is scheduled for sentencing on February 25, 2026. The investigation was conducted by the FBI and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Inspector General. The case is part of a broader effort by the Justice Department's Criminal Division to combat health care fraud, which has resulted in charges against over 5,800 defendants since 2007, amounting to more than $30 billion in fraudulent claims.
