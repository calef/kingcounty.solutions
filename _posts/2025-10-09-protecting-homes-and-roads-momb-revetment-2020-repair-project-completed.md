The King County Flood Control District (KCFCD) and King County service provider have completed the Momb Revetment 2020 Repair Project on Issaquah Creek. The project, designed to reduce flood risk for residents, roads, and utilities in the Cedar Grove community, also supports fish habitat in the creek. The Momb Revetment, which protects Southeast 156th Street, Cedar Grove Road SE, and public utilities, was damaged by flooding in February 2020. The repair, completed over two days in August 2025, involved enhancing the existing revetment and restoring the site with beneficial materials and methods. The project will be finalized with planting in November 2025.
