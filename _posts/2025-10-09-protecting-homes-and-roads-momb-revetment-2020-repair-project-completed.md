  On August 11 and 12, 2025, the King County Flood Control District (KCFCD), together with King County as service provider, successfully completed the [Momb Revetment 2020 Repair Project](https://kingcounty.gov/en/dept/dnrp/nature-recreation/environment-ecology-conservation/flood-services/capital-projects-studies/momb-revetment-repair-project) on Issaquah Creek. This important project provides flood risk reduction for residents, roads, and utilities in the Cedar Grove community while also supporting fish habitat in Issaquah Creek.

  ## **Why the Repair Was Needed**

  The Momb Revetment, located at River Mile 10.4 of Issaquah Creek, protects Southeast 156th Street, Cedar Grove Road SE, and public utilities. Southeast 156th Street is a private road that provides sole access to approximately 30 residences.

  In February 2020, flooding on Issaquah Creek caused about 100 feet of damage to the 500-foot-long facility. Erosion and scour caused loss of toe and bank armor rock and exposed unarmored bank material landward of the revetment.

  Without repair, continued erosion could have exacerbated damage to the revetment, threatening SE 156th Street and local utilities and increasing flood risks to nearby properties and the adjacent King County bridge.

  ## **What the Repair Involved**

  King County, serving as the KCFCD’s service provider, led construction of the repair over two days in August 2025. The work included:

  - Enhancing approximately 100-feet of existing revetment by installing anchored large wood (a biostabilization technique and fish habitat benefit) to reinforce the creek bank and reduce probability of bank retreat caused by erosion.
  - Restoring the site with materials and methods that benefit both residents and the natural environment.
  - Coming this fall: planting in November 2025 will finalize the project.

  This approach not only reduces flood risk for homes and infrastructure but also improves habitat conditions for fish in Issaquah Creek.

  Construction was carefully scheduled to minimize disruptions. While most residents experienced no major delays, occasional one-lane operations and short closures (10–15 minutes each) occurred along Southeast 156th Street during construction – less than what was expected during project planning.

  Neighbors were informed with mailings, onsite signage, and project webpage updates. Outreach was also conducted with the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe, local agencies, permitting partners, and other interested parties.

  ## **Looking Ahead**

  With the Momb Revetment now repaired, residents have reduced risk from flooding and erosion. Ongoing site monitoring will continue through winter 2025 to ensure the project performs as designed.

  The project demonstrates the KCFCD’s commitment to safeguarding critical infrastructure, supporting public safety, and enhancing the natural environment.

The King County Flood Control District (KCFCD) and King County service provider have completed the Momb Revetment 2020 Repair Project on Issaquah Creek. The project, designed to reduce flood risk for residents, roads, and utilities in the Cedar Grove community, also supports fish habitat in the creek. The Momb Revetment, which protects Southeast 156th Street, Cedar Grove Road SE, and public utilities, was damaged by flooding in February 2020. The repair, completed over two days in August 2025, involved enhancing the existing revetment and restoring the site with beneficial materials and methods. The project will be finalized with planting in November 2025.
