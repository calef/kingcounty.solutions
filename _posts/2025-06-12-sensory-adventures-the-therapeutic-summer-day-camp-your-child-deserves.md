For families of children with neurodiverse profiles or who face challenges in more traditional camp settings, this search can feel particularly daunting. The right environmental fit can make all the difference between a summer filled with joy or one of stress and frustration. Encompass is excited to offer a unique day camp experience through our Sensory Adventures Therapeutic Immersion Camp.**

  At Sensory Adventures Camp, children aged 5-8 who may not thrive in typical camp environments are given a safe, supportive, and therapeutic space to be seen, heard, and valued. Our pediatric therapy team understands the significance of meeting children where they are emotionally and developmentally. Many traditional camps simply aren’t equipped to provide the individualized support that children with mental health, speech, or occupational challenges need.

  This is where Sensory Adventures Camp stands out. With a foundation built on Trust-Based Relational Interventions (TBRI) and DIR Floortime, this camp offers an approach that is not only trauma-informed but intensely focused on supporting children’s developmental needs. The program is thoughtfully designed to support children in managing emotions, developing social skills, and improving communication. Our dedicated therapists create a nurturing environment that honors each child’s unique sensory needs and emotional journeys and will integrate one-on-one therapeutic support throughout the camp day:

  - Mental health therapists will help children build and practice emotional regulation skills, learn to advocate for their own needs, and develop trust in safe adults.
  - Occupational therapists will support children in navigating their sensory experiences and improving their ability to regulate.
  - Speech therapists will guide children in enhancing their communication skills, focusing on peer interactions and functional communication.

  This multidisciplinary approach ensures every child’s unique needs are met while they enjoy fun, hands-on learning that emphasizes play, creativity, and connection.

  **Understanding Physical Cues**

  One of the most exciting parts of Sensory Adventures Camp is the focus on interoception (the ability to recognize and interpret the signals our bodies send us). For many people, understanding physical sensations like hunger, tiredness, or anxiety can be challenging. Children will learn and practice how to identify and respond to these sensations, which will help them build self-awareness and emotional regulation.

  **Peer Interaction**

  ![](https://encompassnw.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Sensory-Adventures-blog-1-300x200.jpg)Peer communication will be a major focus of camp. Through structured play and small group interactions, children will practice and improve their social communication skills in a low-pressure/low-demand, supportive environment. Group interactions will be based on shared special interests so that kids aren’t trying to connect with peers or activities they don’t find interesting.&nbsp; Learning to connect with peers, express emotional and physical needs, and understand relational cues is essential, but can be difficult. By focusing on these skills in a calm, structured environment, Sensory Adventures provides a foundation for future social authenticity.

  **Self-Advocacy**

  Another key part of the camp’s mission is to teach children how to advocate for themselves. Whether asking for a break when they’re feeling overwhelmed, requesting sensory tools, or simply expressing a need, learning to communicate needs effectively is an important skill for all children, especially those with neurodiverse profiles.&nbsp; When kids can advocate for themselves either verbally or through Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices, their levels of frustration and aggression decrease significantly.

  **Trusted Relationships**

  The Sensory Adventures Camp is led by a trauma-informed educator who understands the importance of building trust before attempting learning activities. Many of the children who attend camp may have experienced trauma or struggle with anxiety, so having a safe adult who can connect with them through playful interactions and guide them through challenging moments is essential. This trust-building aspect is a cornerstone of Sensory Adventures Camp, ensuring that every child feels supported, seen, and heard throughout their time at camp.

  **Play!**

  ![](https://encompassnw.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Cover-option-2-300x200.jpg)At Sensory Adventures Camp, the learning process is grounded in hands-on play and curiosity-driven exploration. We know that children learn best when they are engaged and excited, so each day is filled with opportunities for kids to explore, create, and discover. Whether they are playing in sensory-rich activities or engaging in imaginative group play, the goal is always to spark curiosity, build a love for learning, and create memories of feeling connected with others that will stay with them long after camp ends.

  By incorporating play-based therapies into the daily routine, kids are given the chance to practice real-world skills in a safe environment. Play is THE work of childhood, and we firmly believe that through play, children can express themselves, develop essential relationship skills, and experience joy.

  Ultimately, Sensory Adventures isn’t just a summer camp. It’s a carefully crafted therapeutic experience designed to meet the unique needs of neurodiverse children in a way that traditional camps simply can’t. By integrating trauma-informed care, interoception practices, and peer communication skill-building into each day, this camp offers more than just play; it offers a chance for children to feel seen, heard, and supported. If your child is looking for a place to grow, learn, and explore, without the pressures of a traditional camp, this is the perfect place. Give your child the gift of a summer filled with support, understanding, and fun that could make a lasting difference in their emotional, social, and developmental growth.
