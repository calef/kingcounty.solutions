Free summer arts activities and mental health resources for Seattle teens are available at local community centers from July 21 to August 23, 2025, as part of Mayor Harrell’s Reach Out Initiative. Teens aged 13 to 19 can engage in Community Hub programs, featuring arts-based classes led by local teaching artists. Offered at seven citywide locations, these classes include various cultural arts opportunities such as dance, jewelry-making, and singing/songwriting.

At Garfield Community Center, teens can access peer support and safe spaces for free virtual therapy, providing a confidential environment for youth to connect with telehealth providers. These telehealth services are available Monday through Friday from 12 to 6 PM.

For additional details on the Community Hub schedule and mental health support services for young people ages 13 to 24, resources are accessible through the Seattle Department of Education and Early Learning. Language assistance is available for all participants.
