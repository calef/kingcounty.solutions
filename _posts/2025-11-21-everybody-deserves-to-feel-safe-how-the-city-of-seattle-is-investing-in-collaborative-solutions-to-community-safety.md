The City of Seattle is enhancing community safety through collaborative efforts that prioritize resident input and culturally responsive solutions. In 2025, Denise Colvin was appointed as the community capacity and safety manager within the Seattle Department of Neighborhoods (DON), tasked with ensuring community voices are integral to public safety strategies. Colvin oversees contracts that fund community-led safety initiatives in neighborhoods such as Chinatown International District, South Park, Ballard, and Capitol Hill. This approach aims to build trust between communities and police, focusing on empowering residents to voice their safety concerns and develop alternatives to traditional policing.

DON is also partnering with the Seattle Police Department (SPD) for the Community SeaStat series, facilitating monthly dialogues to incorporate community feedback into policing plans. Additionally, a new feature in the Find It Fix It mobile app will enable residents to report nonemergency issues, aiding police in crime data collection. Historically, Seattle's community safety initiatives began after the tragic murder of activist Donnie Chin in 2016, leading to the establishment of neighborhood safety coordinators and community-led crime prevention programs. These efforts emphasize prevention and community involvement, fostering a safer environment for all Seattle residents.
