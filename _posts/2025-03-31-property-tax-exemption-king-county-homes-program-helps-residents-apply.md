Starting in May 2025, King County will launch the HOMES program, designed to assist eligible residents in applying for property tax exemptions. This program targets older adults, veterans, and individuals with disabilities, especially as the income limit for eligibility increases to $84,000, allowing more residents to benefit from the exemption. The HOMES program will host monthly in-person workshops on the third Saturday of each month, where trained counselors will provide application assistance. Participants must be 62 years or older, disabled, or veterans with a service-connected disability rating of 80% or more. Required documents include the previous year’s tax return, disability verification, proof of age or ID, property ownership documents, and records of out-of-pocket medical expenses.

In addition, starting in June, the King County Dispute Resolution Center will hold virtual Information Hub meetings. These sessions aim to connect homeowners with resources for foreclosure prevention. The HOMES program and the KCDRC are committed to helping residents navigate housing challenges and promote community stability through support and guidance.
