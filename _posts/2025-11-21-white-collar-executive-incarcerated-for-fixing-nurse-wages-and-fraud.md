Eduardo “Eddie” Lopez, a Las Vegas executive, has been sentenced to 40 months in prison for orchestrating a conspiracy to fix wages for home healthcare nurses between March 2016 and May 2019. In addition to his prison term, he faces $550,000 in fines and must pay $2,496,101 in restitution to the buyer of his home healthcare company, which he sold for over $10 million while concealing an ongoing antitrust investigation. This case marks the Justice Department's first conviction for wage-fixing, highlighting the seriousness of such violations. Attorney General Pamela Bondi emphasized the commitment to protecting American workers, particularly the nurses affected by Lopez's actions. Assistant Attorney General Abigail Slater noted that wage-fixing is a significant crime that undermines the principle of fair compensation for work. The U.S. Attorney's Office, along with the Antitrust Division and the FBI, worked on the investigation, aiming to hold accountable those who exploit workers for personal gain. FBI Director Kash Patel reiterated the agency's dedication to combating corruption and fraud that harms Americans.
