  NOTE: The next Bellevue City Council meeting will be Wednesday, Nov. 12 due to the November General Election Nov. 4 and Veteran’s Day Nov. 11.

  At Tuesday’s meeting, the City Council was introduced to proposed adjustments for the second year of the city’s 2025-2026 biennial budget and briefed on potential implications of the current economic outlook.

  The presentation highlighted that the mid-biennium budget continues progress on major council priorities in the 2025-2026 budget, adopted last November. The budget supports prior investments and strategically invests in forward-focused efforts including planning, growing capacity, and transformative projects that will contribute to Bellevue’s continued growth and vibrancy.&nbsp;

A 1% annual property tax adjustment for 2026 is also part of the proposed mid-biennium budget, and equates to a $15 increase for a $1.5 million property in Bellevue.

  The proposed budget adjustments also included new fee schedules such as an adjusted sewer rate, fees supporting building, land use, fire, transportation, survey, and utilities plan review and inspection, and transportation wireless communication fees.

  The King County Wastewater Treatment Division adopted a higher wholesale wastewater treatment cost increase earlier this year.

  ## Council reviews brand outreach findings

  In other business, the council was presented with findings from an initial community outreach effort aimed at evaluating and enhancing Bellevue’s brand identity in support of [Council Priority #2](https://bellevuewa.gov/sites/default/files/media/pdf_document/2024/Council Priorities 24-26.pdf).

  The outreach activities included community members, businesses, community organizations, and city staff, focusing on gathering perceptions and preferences related to the visual, verbal, and behavioral aspects of the city’s brand. Key community feedback included using trusted messengers in the community to better connect city services and information to people, ensuring communications from the city are easy to understand and translate, updating visual elements of the city brand to reflect the vibrancy of the community, and providing more forward-looking information for community members on what is happening at the city.

  The feedback received will inform a detailed work plan for brand and communication improvements with both short- and long-term strategies identified.

  ## Eastgate Housing campus update&nbsp;

  The Council also received a written update on efforts to foster a safe and welcoming community for all in Eastgate. In September, the Office of Housing presented an action plan to address safety concerns around the Eastgate housing campus, which included collaborating with PorchLight men’s shelter and Plymouth Crossing permanent supportive housing.

  Since then, the city has increased staff visits to the campus and nearby greenbelts and assigned a Bellevue Police officer to regularly monitor the area. Porchlight and Plymouth Crossing have also adjusted their programs to reduce potential loitering in the area and to enhance services on site.

  Staff will continue to monitor the impact of the adjustments and engage with Eastgate residents and businesses, in partnership with PorchLight and Plymouth Crossing.

The Bellevue City Council recently began discussions on mid-biennium budget adjustments for the 2025-2026 biennial budget, focusing on the implications of the current economic outlook. Proposed adjustments aim to support major council priorities, with updates reflecting revised revenue projections and expenditure changes. A 1% property tax increase for 2026 is included, translating to a $15 rise for a $1.5 million property. The adjustments also introduce new fee schedules, including an increase in the sewer rate from 7.6% to 7.9% due to higher wholesale wastewater treatment costs. Changes to permitting and review fees are proposed to keep services competitive. Additionally, impact fees for local school districts have been reduced to zero due to lower student enrollment. 

In other council business, findings from a community outreach effort to enhance Bellevue's brand identity were reviewed. Feedback indicated a need for clearer communication and updated visual branding. The council also received an update on safety initiatives at the Eastgate housing campus, where increased staff monitoring and program adjustments aim to improve community safety and engagement. A public hearing is scheduled for November 12 to gather community feedback on the proposed budget adjustments.
