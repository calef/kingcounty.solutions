The Bellevue City Council recently began discussions on mid-biennium budget adjustments for the 2025-2026 biennial budget, focusing on the implications of the current economic outlook. Proposed adjustments aim to support major council priorities, with updates reflecting revised revenue projections and expenditure changes. A 1% property tax increase for 2026 is included, translating to a $15 rise for a $1.5 million property. The adjustments also introduce new fee schedules, including an increase in the sewer rate from 7.6% to 7.9% due to higher wholesale wastewater treatment costs. Changes to permitting and review fees are proposed to keep services competitive. Additionally, impact fees for local school districts have been reduced to zero due to lower student enrollment. 

In other council business, findings from a community outreach effort to enhance Bellevue's brand identity were reviewed. Feedback indicated a need for clearer communication and updated visual branding. The council also received an update on safety initiatives at the Eastgate housing campus, where increased staff monitoring and program adjustments aim to improve community safety and engagement. A public hearing is scheduled for November 12 to gather community feedback on the proposed budget adjustments.
