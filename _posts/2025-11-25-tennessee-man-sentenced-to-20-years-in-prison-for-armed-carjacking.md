A 23-year-old man from Tennessee, Jadakiss Johnson, has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in an armed carjacking in Memphis. On April 9, 2024, Johnson and co-defendant Tyrone White, who has been sentenced to over nine years, carjacked a 2023 Toyota Camry at gunpoint. Johnson drove the vehicle while White threatened the victim with a firearm and forced her to exit the car. After the robbery, Johnson attempted to evade law enforcement but was apprehended. Authorities discovered multiple firearms and a machinegun-conversion device in his getaway car. Johnson, a prohibited firearm possessor due to prior violent felony convictions, pleaded guilty to charges of aiding and abetting the carjacking and the use of a firearm during the crime. Evidence presented at his sentencing included his violent behavior in custody and prior access to firearms. The case was investigated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the Memphis Police Department, forming part of a broader initiative to tackle violent crime in the region.
