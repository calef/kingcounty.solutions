At Tesla STEM High School, the Mental Health Club, co-led by Naomi and Dhaani, has become a vital space for students to discuss mental health and support one another. In their first meeting of the school year, members shared personal experiences related to summer activities, academic pressures, and family dynamics, creating a foundation for open dialogue. The club aims to raise awareness about mental health and foster community connections, with sessions dedicated to topics like test anxiety and sleep. Members also engage in community outreach by volunteering with NAMI and advocating for mental health awareness.

Students expressed a desire for adults to better understand the pressures they face, highlighting the impact of social media and the high expectations prevalent in their high-achieving environment. They believe schools are crucial for providing support and normalizing discussions around mental health. The club seeks to bridge gaps between students and teachers, emphasizing the need for collaboration to improve mental health awareness. Through initiatives like this, students are empowered to redefine success, build connections, and cultivate a supportive culture within their school, addressing anxiety and stress as they navigate their educational journeys.
