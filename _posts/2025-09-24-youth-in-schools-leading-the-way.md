  <h1 data-start="259" data-end="324">Tesla High School’s Mental Health Club</h1>
  <p data-start="326" data-end="607">On a recent Wednesday afternoon, the halls of Tesla STEM High School were buzzing with the usual end-of-day activity. But tucked away in Behavioral Health Support Specialist Cora Goss-Grubbs’ office, a group of students gathered for something unique, Tesla’s Mental Health Club.</p>
  <p data-start="609" data-end="1023">It was the first official meeting of the school year, led by co-presidents Naomi and Dhaani. They welcomed new members with an icebreaker, sharing how their summer had gone and what stressors were currently on their minds. Students opened up about travel, summer jobs, complicated family dynamics, and the heavy load of new classes and homework. Several admitted to feeling “badgered about college decisions.”</p>
  <p data-start="1025" data-end="1178">This honest start set the tone for what the club is all about: creating a safe and supportive community where students can discuss what truly matters.</p>
  <h2 data-start="1185" data-end="1223">A Space for Connection and Coping</h2>
  <p data-start="1225" data-end="1584">The co-presidents explained that the club’s goals are to raise awareness about mental health, provide an open space for discussions, and share coping tools. Wednesdays will focus on specific topics, such as test anxiety and the importance of sleep, while Fridays will be open sessions for members to discuss any challenges they’ve faced that week. There’s also comfort in the little things: hot chocolate, tea, snacks, and the chance to relax with peers.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p data-start="1586" data-end="1783">“It’s an opportunity to make friends, de-stress, and feel less alone,” one student said.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p data-start="1785" data-end="2048">But the club isn’t only about student support. Members are eager to make a broader impact in the community by volunteering with NAMI as youth ambassadors, speaking at conferences, advocating with lawmakers on Lobby Day, and lending their support at YES’s Invest in Youth Breakfast.</p>
  <h2 data-start="2839" data-end="2864">Breaking Down Stigma</h2>
  <p data-start="2866" data-end="3058">The students are passionate about breaking stigma at Tesla and beyond. They start small by sharing coping strategies with friends and then expand the conversations to teachers, families, and social media.</p>
  <p data-start="3060" data-end="3294">They even take what they learn into the classroom. In AP Psychology, for example, members have helped lead discussions about mental health topics, encouraging others to join the club and deepening the conversation across campus.</p>
  <p data-start="3296" data-end="3417">The ripple effect is clear: more students are willing to speak up, normalize seeking help, and advocate for each other.</p>
  <h2 data-start="3424" data-end="3458">What They Want Adults to Hear</h2>
  <p data-start="3460" data-end="3562">When asked what message they wish parents and the community would take away, the room grew animated.</p>
  <blockquote data-start="3564" data-end="3839">
  <p data-start="3566" data-end="3839">“Life is so different now than it was for many adults,” one student said. “Social media has been a huge cost. There’s parent tracking, parent anxiety, overprotectiveness, and hyper-sensationalized content. Just having conversations with us would help parents learn a lot.”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p data-start="3841" data-end="3912">And then, one student summed it up with words that silenced the room:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p data-start="3916" data-end="4182">“Schools are the most effective way of making an impact on teens. Having support where all youth have to be is so important. It’s easy access to help when you need it most and it’s needed now more than ever before with how disconnected everyone is.”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h2 data-start="4189" data-end="4218">The Pressures of Success</h2>
  <p data-start="4220" data-end="4419">Another theme the group raised was the pressure of living in a high-achieving community. With many parents working in tech or immigrating for opportunity, success is defined at a high standard.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p data-start="4421" data-end="4540">“Success to us has become so toxic,” one student explained. “We are fighting each other instead of working together.”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p data-start="4542" data-end="4780">They also spoke about how teachers—often unintentionally—contribute to this stress. This year, the club hopes to open a dialogue with educators, helping them understand how words, tone, and expectations impact student mental health.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p data-start="4782" data-end="4933">“Teachers forget that we’re just kids,” a student said. “Just like they’re more than ‘just teachers.’ We need to break that cycle and work together.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2 data-start="4940" data-end="4961">Why This Matters</h2>

  # Tesla High School’s Mental Health Club

  On a recent Wednesday afternoon, the halls of Tesla STEM High School were buzzing with the usual end-of-day activity. But tucked away in Behavioral Health Support Specialist Cora Goss-Grubbs’ office, a group of students gathered for something unique, Tesla’s Mental Health Club.

  It was the first official meeting of the school year, led by co-presidents Naomi and Dhaani. They welcomed new members with an icebreaker, sharing how their summer had gone and what stressors were currently on their minds. Students opened up about travel, summer jobs, complicated family dynamics, and the heavy load of new classes and homework. Several admitted to feeling “badgered about college decisions.”

  This honest start set the tone for what the club is all about: creating a safe and supportive community where students can discuss what truly matters.

  ## A Space for Connection and Coping

  The co-presidents explained that the club’s goals are to raise awareness about mental health, provide an open space for discussions, and share coping tools. Wednesdays will focus on specific topics, such as test anxiety and the importance of sleep, while Fridays will be open sessions for members to discuss any challenges they’ve faced that week. There’s also comfort in the little things: hot chocolate, tea, snacks, and the chance to relax with peers.

  > “It’s an opportunity to make friends, de-stress, and feel less alone,” one student said.

  But the club isn’t only about student support. Members are eager to make a broader impact in the community by volunteering with NAMI as youth ambassadors, speaking at conferences, advocating with lawmakers on Lobby Day, and lending their support at YES’s Invest in Youth Breakfast.

  ## Breaking Down Stigma

  The students are passionate about breaking stigma at Tesla and beyond. They start small by sharing coping strategies with friends and then expand the conversations to teachers, families, and social media.

  They even take what they learn into the classroom. In AP Psychology, for example, members have helped lead discussions about mental health topics, encouraging others to join the club and deepening the conversation across campus.

  The ripple effect is clear: more students are willing to speak up, normalize seeking help, and advocate for each other.

  ## What They Want Adults to Hear

  When asked what message they wish parents and the community would take away, the room grew animated.

  > “Life is so different now than it was for many adults,” one student said. “Social media has been a huge cost. There’s parent tracking, parent anxiety, overprotectiveness, and hyper-sensationalized content. Just having conversations with us would help parents learn a lot.”

  And then, one student summed it up with words that silenced the room:

  > “Schools are the most effective way of making an impact on teens. Having support where all youth have to be is so important. It’s easy access to help when you need it most and it’s needed now more than ever before with how disconnected everyone is.”

  ## Back-to-School: You Can Change a Life

  Right now, YES is in the middle of our **Back-to-School campaign**. We know, and like the members of the Tesla Mental Health Club shared, that students are returning to classrooms with more than backpacks; they are carrying anxiety, depression, stress, and the weight of high expectations.

At Tesla STEM High School, the Mental Health Club, co-led by Naomi and Dhaani, has become a vital space for students to discuss mental health and support one another. In their first meeting of the school year, members shared personal experiences related to summer activities, academic pressures, and family dynamics, creating a foundation for open dialogue. The club aims to raise awareness about mental health and foster community connections, with sessions dedicated to topics like test anxiety and sleep. Members also engage in community outreach by volunteering with NAMI and advocating for mental health awareness.

Students expressed a desire for adults to better understand the pressures they face, highlighting the impact of social media and the high expectations prevalent in their high-achieving environment. They believe schools are crucial for providing support and normalizing discussions around mental health. The club seeks to bridge gaps between students and teachers, emphasizing the need for collaboration to improve mental health awareness. Through initiatives like this, students are empowered to redefine success, build connections, and cultivate a supportive culture within their school, addressing anxiety and stress as they navigate their educational journeys.
