  dedicated animal control officer requires about $200,000 annually for salary, benefits,
  fleet and equipment to provide 40 hours of service per week (not 24/7 coverage.)
  Due to budget constraints, the City can no longer afford to fund this position.
  Several years ago the City moved animal control services to a contract with Burien
  CARES. The City now has a reduced contract for animal services, which covers legally
  required services.<br>\n<br>\n<strong><em>What animal control services does Des
  Moines provide?</em></strong><br>\nThe City provides limited animal control services
  through a contract with Burien CARES. This contract ensures a response to dangerous
  or potentially dangerous dogs and investigation of dog bites. <br>\n<br>\nThe Des
  Moines Police Department has a microchip reader to help you identify the owner of
  a stray animal. However, the City no longer has staff to respond to lost or found
  pets or other animal control issues.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Why can't the police respond
  to reports of stray animals?</strong><br>\nUnfortunately, our police department
  does not have the capacity to retrieve lost or stray animals and take them to shelters.
  The department is short-staffed due to budget constraints and has vacant positions.
  While we acknowledge that responding to stray animals is an important service, our
  police must prioritize responses to issues of public safety. <br>\n<br>\n<strong><em>How

The City of Des Moines has reduced animal control services due to budget cuts exceeding $4 million for the 2025-26 budget. This resulted in staff layoffs and reduced funding for various services, including a dedicated animal control officer. Currently, animal control is contracted with Burien CARES, covering only essential services like responding to dangerous dogs. The police department is unable to assist with stray animals due to staffing shortages. Residents are encouraged to utilize community platforms for lost or found pets. The City is exploring options to restore services, including improving pet licensing enforcement.
