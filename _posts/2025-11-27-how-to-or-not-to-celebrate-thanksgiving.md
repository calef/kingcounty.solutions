  a co-worker lamented to me that her daughter refused to celebrate Thanksgiving with
  her. This co-worker loved Thanksgiving. For her, it was a holiday rooted in gratitude
  and family bonding. On the other hand, her daughter saw Thanksgiving as a holiday
  that celebrated settler colonialism and deliberately erased the painful history
  of Native American genocide.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This
  divide, often generational, shows up in many families, friend circles, and communities.</span></p>\n<p><span
  style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How can we celebrate Thanksgiving? Should we celebrate
  Thanksgiving? Can we preserve everything we hold dear about this cherished tradition
  in many families while also acknowledging the holiday&#8217;s nuanced and troubled
  history?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As a first-generation
  immigrant to this country from India, Thanksgiving was not part of my tradition
  growing up. The first time I attended a “traditional Thanksgiving” was in grad school,
  when my host family generously invited me and some of my friends to their home.
  Even though it was over twenty years ago now, my memory of that Thanksgiving is
  surprisingly clear. I remember my first time trying cranberry sauce, wondering why
  people like turkey, and asking why a meal eaten midday was called dinner. Since
  my family does not celebrate Thanksgiving, I have had the opportunity, and freedom,
  to attend a wide variety of Thanksgiving dinners over the last two decades, mostly
  with friends and their families. Many immigrants from the Indian diaspora have embraced
  this holiday and found a way to make it their own, sometimes in an effort to assimilate
  with the dominant culture.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the
  Hunger Intervention Program (HIP), we have served many Thanksgiving meals over the
  years. In the last few years, we have intentionally shifted away from serving a
  “traditional” Thanksgiving meal and opted for a Native-American-inspired meal instead.
  Our team has had lively discussions about the importance of this holiday in people’s
  lives. As an organization that values building community over a delicious meal,
  we understand how important a gathering of family and friends can be.</span></p>\n<p><span
  style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At the same time, we cannot ignore the colonial roots
  of this tradition and the myths that still surround this holiday. For many Native
  American peoples, this is a day of mourning. A day that reminds them of the genocide
  of Native Americans and the whitewashing of their history. We can’t simply ‘move
  past’ that without some genuine acknowledgment, understanding, and healing. But
  what will that journey look like? People with deeper knowledge of history and understanding
  of Thanksgiving traditions have shared their opinions on this topic. There is no
  </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one</span></i><span style=\"font-weight:
  400;\"> right way to do it. In my opinion, there are three necessary steps we can
  take to start the process of healing:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>(1)</strong>
  Learn and acknowledge history from a Native American perspective. Most of us are
  taught a sanitized version of the Thanksgiving story from the point of view of the
  pilgrims. That version does not tell the whole story, and the crucial details it
  leaves out need to be addressed before we can reimagine this holiday. I’d encourage
  everyone to seek out unfamiliar perspectives, especially from Native American activists
  and leaders, and consider them with an open mind. Even among Native American tribes,
  there is a broad diversity of perspectives.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:
  20px;\"><strong>(2)</strong> Once we know better, we must do better. Too often,
  there is a tendency to quickly acknowledge the wrongs of the past without taking
  action. It is easy to forget what happened centuries ago and instead focus on all
  the positive aspects of this holiday. However, in our haste to move beyond an uncomfortable
  past, we end up dismissing the hurt and the generational trauma that is still very
  much alive today. Native Americans have a much higher rate of food insecurity, homelessness,
  health disparities, and many barriers to political representation. We can’t move
  past a historical trauma without reconciliation and healing. Some options to consider
  could be incorporating land acknowledgment in your gatherings, supporting native
  tribes in their struggle for sovereignty, political representation, reparation,
  and treaty rights.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>(3)</strong>
  Finally, find new traditions that align with our new understanding and values. We
  do not have to give up family/friend gatherings and sharing delicious meals. In
  fact, we need that more than ever. But not all traditions are worth holding onto.
  There is freedom and power in giving up parts of old traditions that do not match
  our values, and finding new ones. What that might look for you or your family, is
  something you’ll have to decide.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending
  on your traditions, these steps may require more sacrifice for some than others.
  I don’t have any emotional attachment to this holiday, and no family that expects
  me to be at their Thanksgiving dinner. It is easier for me to either renounce this
  holiday or join someone else if I want to. That’s not true for most folks. Everyone
  has their own story of how they come to understand Thanksgiving and how they want
  to engage in this tradition. The most important thing is to not get stuck in the
  same routine, but to take the steps necessary for learning, acting, and finding
  a new path forward in a way that’s meaningful to you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight:

Thanksgiving can be a complex holiday for many. Some feel joy and gratitude, while others experience discomfort due to the historical context of colonization and the ongoing struggles faced by Indigenous communities. Many people grapple with the idea of celebrating a holiday that symbolizes different things to different groups.

For those who choose to celebrate, it is important to approach the holiday thoughtfully. Acknowledging the history of Thanksgiving and recognizing the impact of colonization can help create a more inclusive atmosphere. This can involve educating oneself and others about the true history behind the holiday, supporting Indigenous businesses, and participating in discussions that honor Indigenous perspectives.

Alternatively, some may opt not to celebrate Thanksgiving at all. Individuals might choose to spend the day in reflection or engage in community service to address food insecurity, which is particularly relevant during the holiday season. Ultimately, whether to celebrate or not is a personal choice, shaped by individual beliefs and values. The key is to approach Thanksgiving in a way that is respectful and conscious of its broader implications.
