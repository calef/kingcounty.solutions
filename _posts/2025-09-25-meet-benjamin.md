  _Benjamin, 2011_

  At just 3 years old, Benjamin faced a life no child should endure. In August of 1995, he was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. “Even though I was very young, I still remember going through chemotherapy, dealing with its side effects, getting shots and bloodwork done every week, and having to take ‘thousands’ of pills,” Benjamin recalls.

  His battle with cancer was not just about survival; it was about connection. From his earliest days in treatment, Benjamin formed deep, lasting bonds with the nurses, doctors, and caregivers who supported him. More than a decade later, those relationships remain. During follow-up visits, he is still greeted with warm hugs and familiar faces, a testament to the power of compassion during hardship.

  Cancer shaped Benjamin’s spirit. It gave him perseverance, a maturity beyond his years, and a heartfelt desire to help others, whether in disaster relief, repairing orphanages, or contributing to community development in Thailand. It molded his work ethic and inspired his dream: to walk alongside cancer patients in their recovery.

  After surviving cancer, Benjamin set his sights on a future in medicine. He attended Mississippi College for Biology and Medical Sciences, later pursuing graduate school to fulfill his ambition of becoming a physician. During his undergraduate years, he was awarded the [NCCS Beyond the Cure Ambassador Scholarship](/scholarship), which allowed him to graduate without student loan debt, a gift that changed the trajectory of his education and career.

  Benjamin is now a physician at a university medical center. His commitment to service extends beyond his medical practice: he volunteers as a judge for the NCCS Beyond the Cure Scholarship Program, teaches medical students and residents, and offers his skills at a free homeless clinic. Alongside his professional achievements, he is also a devoted husband and proud father of three.

  From a scared child receiving chemotherapy to a confident physician dedicating his life to healing others, Benjamin truly embodies resilience, compassion, and purpose.
