Meet Benjamin, a remarkable individual who overcame acute lymphoblastic leukemia diagnosed at just 3 years old. His treatment journey, filled with chemotherapy and numerous medical procedures, forged deep connections with his caregivers, which remain strong to this day. These experiences cultivated Benjamin's resilience and maturity, fueling his desire to help others. After surviving cancer, he pursued a career in medicine, attending Mississippi College for Biology and Medical Sciences, and later graduate school, supported by the NCCS Beyond the Cure Ambassador Scholarship, which alleviated his student debt.

Now a physician at a university medical center, Benjamin extends his commitment to service by volunteering as a judge for the NCCS scholarship program, teaching medical students, and working at a free clinic for the homeless. He balances his professional life with being a devoted husband and father of three. Benjamin's journey from a frightened child to a compassionate healer embodies the spirit of resilience and purpose, proving that survivors can thrive and inspire others. He aspires to positively influence the lives of cancer patients, just as his caregivers did for him, acknowledging that his diagnosis shaped his life's path profoundly.
