This month's Lake to Lake news show highlights the opening reception of an art exhibition at City Hall featuring local Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander artists. The event, held in early May, featured flower-adorned dancers and will showcase the artwork throughout the month. The program also includes key moments from the State of the City presentation, where city staff and partners emphasized the theme of community collaboration with the Bellevue Downtown Association. Additionally, a panel of climate experts provided insights on fostering resilience, and community members contributed to updating the comprehensive plan finalized last year. The show is produced by Bellevue Television, with all city videos available on their YouTube channel. For inquiries, contact btv@bellevuewa.gov.
