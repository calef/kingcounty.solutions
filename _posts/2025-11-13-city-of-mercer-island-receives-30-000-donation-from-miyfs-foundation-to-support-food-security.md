The city of Mercer Island has received a $30,000 donation from the Mercer Island Youth and Family Services (MIYFS) Foundation to enhance food security for more than 200 households affected by recent federal cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). The funds will be used to purchase grocery cards for local stores and integrated into the Emergency Assistance program. Eligible households will receive grocery cards biweekly for up to four months, with $50 for single residents and $100 for larger families. The initiative aims to alleviate food insecurity during this challenging time.
