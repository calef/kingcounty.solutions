  <h2 class="wp-block-heading">AI voice tool quietly takes notes so providers can focus on you</h2>



  <p>At some VA medical centers, Veterans may notice something new during their appointments: Providers are spending more time talking to the patient and less time typing on the computer. That’s because VA’s Digital Health Office (DHO) introduced a new <a href="https://news.va.gov/?s=%22artificial+intelligence%22&amp;post_type%5B%5D=post&amp;post_type%5B%5D=page&amp;search_limit_to_post_titles=0&amp;add_woo_product_skus=0&amp;fs=1">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) technology, called ambient AI scribe. With the Veteran’s permission, ambient AI scribe works quietly in the background, giving VA health care providers more time to focus on what matters most: Connecting with Veterans.</p>



  <p>“Veterans said they felt more connected to their provider because they were having a real conversation, not talking to someone typing on a computer,” said Donna Hill, director of Operations for AI and Emerging Technologies, Digital Health Office.</p>



  <p>Veterans who have already experienced ambient AI scribe agreed, citing the value of human connection. As one Veteran told VA, “My provider would look me in the eye and have an actual conversation.”</p>



  <h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is ambient AI scribe technology?</h2>



  <p>The ambient AI scribe technology is designed to listen, and it generates progress notes from the clinic visit and processes the conversation between the health care provider and the patient. It saves time reduces paperwork for the provider, while improving the accuracy of the visit. More importantly, it puts the Veteran at the center of care.</p>

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the care experience for veterans. AI tools are being implemented to streamline processes, improve efficiency, and provide better service. The VA has developed a range of AI applications, including predictive analytics to anticipate veterans' needs and machine learning algorithms to optimize resource allocation. These innovations aim to reduce wait times, improve appointment scheduling, and personalize care plans. 

Additionally, AI is being used to analyze patient feedback and health records to identify trends and areas for improvement. The VA is also focusing on training staff to effectively use these AI tools, ensuring that technology complements human expertise. By harnessing AI, the VA aims to create a more responsive and tailored healthcare experience for veterans, ultimately enhancing their overall satisfaction and health outcomes. The integration of AI represents a significant step forward in the VA’s commitment to providing high-quality care and support to those who have served in the military.
