The City of Bellevue is allocating $235,000 to address immediate food assistance needs in response to recent federal reductions in SNAP benefits, impacting over 3,000 households and about 4,000 children in the area. The Bellevue School District has noted a rise in students eligible for free or reduced lunch, now affecting one in four students. Mayor Lynne Robinson emphasized the urgency of the situation, highlighting the uncertainty families face regarding their next meal. The city plans to distribute $150,000 from operating contingency funds to 11 community organizations already providing food assistance, ensuring quick support through established channels. Additionally, the parks and community services department will distribute grocery gift cards, funded by $85,000 in community donations, to agencies involved in the Essentials For All food and hygiene drive, which continues through November 15. City Manager Diane Carlson expressed gratitude for community partners collaborating on this critical initiative, which builds on the $17 million already invested in human services during the current biennium. The city will keep monitoring and exploring options to further address community needs during challenging times.
