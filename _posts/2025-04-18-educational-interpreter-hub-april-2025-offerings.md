Upcoming professional development opportunities include the "Building Bridges: Five-Week Receptive Skills Training" for interpreters, led by Richard Jacobs and Dr. Taralynn Petrites. This program allows interpreters to enhance their receptive and expressive skills through interaction with Deaf professionals. Sessions will occur via Zoom on Wednesdays from 5:30 PM to 7:00 PM, where participants can schedule 4 to 6 individual 30-minute sessions with Deaf mentors. These mentors will cover topics such as fingerspelling, ASL storytelling, and Deaf culture, offering a valuable preparation opportunity for the EIPA exam.

Additionally, a new EIPA performance test site will open in Federal Way starting April 2025. An open house event will be held for individuals interested in viewing the testing environment and practice materials. The open house is scheduled for Tuesday, March 25th, from 5-7 PM, and Wednesday, March 26th, from 4-6 PM. For inquiries, participants can contact the CDHY Interpreter Hub Coordinator, Melissa Klindtworth.
