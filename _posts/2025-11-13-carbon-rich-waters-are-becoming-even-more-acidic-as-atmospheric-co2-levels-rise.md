title: Carbon-rich waters are becoming even more acidic as atmospheric CO2 levels
  rise

Recent research indicates that the Northeastern Pacific Ocean is acidifying at an alarming rate due to rising atmospheric CO2 levels. Since the industrial revolution, ocean acidity has increased by approximately 30%, affecting marine organisms like corals and clams that rely on carbonate minerals for their shells and skeletons. The study, published in Nature Communications, highlights that the region's naturally higher acidity makes it more susceptible to further changes from human activities. Analyzing coral skeletal records from the past century, researchers found that CO2 levels in North American waters are rising faster than in the atmosphere, leading to significant acidification. The study utilized historical coral samples collected between 1888 and 1932, comparing them to modern specimens to track changes in ocean chemistry. Findings suggest that acidification is more pronounced 100 to 200 meters below the surface, challenging traditional assumptions about ocean acidification being primarily a surface phenomenon. While the results are concerning, researchers emphasize the potential for corrective actions to mitigate future impacts, stressing the importance of understanding regional changes in ocean acidity as a precursor to global trends.
