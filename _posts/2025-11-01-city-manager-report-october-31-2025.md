original_content: What’s Next for City Hall? We often receive the question, “What’s
  going on with replacing City Hall?” I would like to take this opportunity to provide
  an update on the project's status and outline the next steps. As many residents
  know, the future of Normandy Park City Hall has been a topic of discussion for several
  years. Our current building was originally constructed in the 1950s as an elementary
  school and later converted into City Hall in the late 1980s. While it has served
  the community well, it was never intended to function as a modern municipal facility.
  As a result, the City has been exploring options to ensure that we have a safe,
  efficient, and functional building that can continue to serve residents daily.

The City of Normandy Park is weighing options for the future of its City Hall. The building, originally constructed in the 1950s, needs significant maintenance and upgrades to continue functioning as a municipal facility. A Comprehensive Building Assessment confirmed the need for improvements, which are estimated to cost around $5 million. The City Council is considering two options: renovating the existing building or constructing a new City Hall for approximately $12 million. The City is financially stable to fund a new facility without additional tax burden. The discussion will continue at the January 2026 Council Retreat. No final decisions have been made.
