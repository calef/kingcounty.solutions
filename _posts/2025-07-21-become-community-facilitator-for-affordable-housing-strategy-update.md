The City of Bellevue is seeking community facilitators for its 2025 Affordable Housing Strategy to enhance participation from diverse voices, particularly those struggling to find safe and affordable housing. The Office of Housing aims to engage residents who live, work, study, or have connections in Bellevue. Facilitators will be trained to lead community conversations scheduled for August and September, focusing on renters and individuals earning below the area’s median income. The strategy's goal is to ensure housing accessibility for all, regardless of income or background. Applications for facilitator positions are open until July 30, with interviews occurring on a rolling basis until August 6. The city is also hosting virtual information sessions on July 23 and July 24 for interested applicants. Contracts for facilitators will be managed by a consulting firm.
