Women veterans are a rapidly growing demographic within the U.S. military community, making up 10% of all veterans. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) emphasizes that women veterans deserve equitable access to healthcare and services. VA Secretary Denis McDonough highlighted the importance of creating an inclusive environment where women veterans feel welcomed and supported.

Efforts are underway to enhance services for women veterans, including expanding maternity care and addressing unique health issues. The VA is also focused on improving mental health services and combating the stigma surrounding mental health challenges faced by women veterans. Initiatives such as the Women Veterans Program aim to provide tailored resources and support.

The VA encourages women veterans to engage with their facilities and seek the benefits they have earned. Through outreach and community events, the VA aims to foster a sense of belonging among women veterans, ensuring they know they are valued members of the veteran community. The commitment to serving women veterans reflects a broader mission to ensure all veterans receive the care and recognition they deserve.
