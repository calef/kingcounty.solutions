  Eating well is one of the most important things you can do for your brain health.

  A brain-friendly diet includes foods like **nuts** , **berries** , **leafy greens** , **fish** , **healthy fats** , and **whole grains** , while limiting **butter** , **fried foods** , **red meat** , and **sweets**. Two great examples of diets that support brain health are the **Mediterranean diet** and the **MIND diet**. Studies show that people who follow these diets tend to have a lower risk of cognitive decline and may delay the onset of dementia.

  Colorful berries—especially those with **blue, red, purple, or orange skins** —contain plant compounds called **anthocyanins** , which help reduce inflammation and protect the brain from damaging free radicals. **Nuts** are also packed with healthy fats and **polyphenols** , which support brain health by reducing inflammation.

  That said, it’s important to remember that eating a handful of nuts or berries won’t cancel out a diet full of cheeseburgers and fries. Brain health benefits come from an overall healthy eating pattern—not just a few good choices here and there.

  **Variety matters too.** A diverse diet helps maintain a healthy gut microbiome, which is linked to brain health. So mix it up—don’t rely on just one type of nut or berry every day.

  ### Mediterranean & MIND Diet Highlights

  The **Mediterranean diet** encourages regular consumption of:

  - **Olive oil** , **fruits** , **vegetables** , **beans** , **fish** , and **healthy fats**
  - It limits **red meat** , **butter** , **processed sweets** , and **soda**
  - Recommends **3+ servings of fruit daily** and **3+ servings of nuts weekly**

  If berries aren’t your thing or aren’t available, **all fruits are beneficial**. A mix of **bananas** , **avocados** , **kiwifruit** , and **tomatoes** is a great alternative.

  The **MIND diet** is similar to the Mediterranean diet but is more restrictive with **dairy products**.

  ### Other Ways to Support Brain Health

  In addition to a healthy diet, here are other ways to help protect your brain and reduce your risk of dementia:

  1. **Keep your brain active** with games, puzzles, and learning new skills.
  2. **Get your hearing checked** and use hearing aids if needed; avoid loud noise exposure.
  3. **Treat depression** effectively.
  4. **Wear helmets** during contact sports and when biking.
  5. **Exercise regularly** —physical activity is linked to lower dementia risk.
  6. **Quit smoking**.
  7. **Manage blood pressure** , aiming for a systolic reading of 130 mmHg or lower starting at age 40.
  8. **Monitor cholesterol** , especially LDL, from midlife onward.
  9. **Maintain a healthy weight** and address obesity early to help prevent diabetes.
  10. **Limit alcohol intake**.
  11. **Stay socially connected**.
  12. **Take care of your vision** —get regular eye exams.
  13. **Reduce exposure to air pollution**.
  14. **Practice good sleep habits**.

Eating a brain-friendly diet is essential for reducing the risk of dementia. Recommended foods include nuts, berries, leafy greens, fish, healthy fats, and whole grains, while limiting butter, fried foods, red meat, and sweets. The Mediterranean and MIND diets are noted for their brain health benefits, as those who follow these diets often experience lower cognitive decline and delayed dementia onset. Colorful berries, rich in anthocyanins, and nuts, packed with healthy fats and polyphenols, are particularly beneficial. However, a consistent overall healthy eating pattern is more effective than occasional good choices. Variety in diet supports a healthy gut microbiome, crucial for brain health.

In addition to diet, maintaining brain health involves keeping the brain active through games and learning, managing hearing health, treating depression, using protective gear during sports, exercising regularly, quitting smoking, managing blood pressure and cholesterol, maintaining a healthy weight, limiting alcohol intake, staying socially connected, ensuring good vision, reducing exposure to air pollution, practicing good sleep habits, and controlling blood sugar levels.
