The King County Sheriff's Office is acting as an independent investigative team for a recent officer-involved shooting in Seattle. The incident occurred on Dec. 3, 2025, when Seattle police officers responded to a report of a man with a gun at a gas station. Upon arrival, officers approached the suspect, who allegedly threatened them with a weapon. An officer fired their weapon, striking the suspect, who was then taken to the hospital for treatment of injuries. The involved officers have been placed on administrative leave per standard procedure. The investigation is being conducted by the King County Sheriff's Office to ensure an unbiased review of the circumstances surrounding the event. This independent investigation aims to provide transparency and accountability in the process of reviewing the use of force by law enforcement. Additional details regarding the incident, including the condition of the suspect, have not been disclosed as the investigation is ongoing.
