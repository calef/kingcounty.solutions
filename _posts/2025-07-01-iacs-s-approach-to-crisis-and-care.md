The International Association of Crisis and Care Services (IACS) provides a network of services for crisis support, including healthcare access, support for survivors of domestic and sexual abuse, and aid for families and entrepreneurs dealing with instability. The Covid-19 pandemic saw an upsurge in domestic violence cases, with IACS providing crucial assistance. The organization also acknowledges the emotional toll on its own staff, often experiencing vicarious trauma, compassion fatigue, burnout, and secondary PTSD. IACS invests in trauma-informed care and mental health resources for its staff, maintaining a support system for both survivors and the crisis workers assisting them.
