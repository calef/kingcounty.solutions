Life can be particularly challenging for those who have experienced sexual assault, leading many to seek safety in withdrawal and isolation. An author recounts her childhood, marked by abuse from family members, which instilled a deep sense of fear and mistrust. This isolation was a coping mechanism, yet it ultimately trapped her in loneliness and despair, affecting her relationships and enjoyment of life. The author emphasizes that such feelings are common among survivors, who often perceive judgment from others and remain haunted by their trauma.

After years of battling panic attacks and loneliness, the author found the courage to reach out to KCSARC (King County Sexual Assault Resource Center). Through counseling, she gradually shed her fears and began to embrace happiness. She encourages others facing similar struggles to seek help, reminding them that they are not alone and that healing is possible. KCSARC offers a 24-hour resource line for confidential support, inviting survivors to break through their isolation and embark on a journey toward recovery. Each survivor’s healing process is unique, and support is available to guide them through their challenges.
