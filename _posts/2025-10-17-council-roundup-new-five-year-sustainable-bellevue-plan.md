  2026 state legislative agenda and Mini City Hall update</p><p>On Tuesday, the City
  Council unanimously voted to adopt the 2026-2030 Sustainable Bellevue Plan on the
  consent agenda in November. This plan represents the second major update to the
  original plan, which was first adopted in 2021 to achieve the ambitious goal of
  reducing greenhouse gas emissions to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The city
  has made notable progress in this endeavor by implementing various strategies outlined
  in the plan. &nbsp;</p><p>The updated plan features a comprehensive suite of strengthened,
  cost-effective and high-impact strategies designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
  and increase climate resilience. It is organized around five focus areas: climate
  change, energy and buildings, mobility and land use, waste, and natural systems—with
  actions to enhance sustainability throughout the community and in city operations.
  Key actions proposed in the plan include expanding the Energy Smart Eastside program,
  promoting building decarbonization and further electrifying the city's vehicle fleet.
  &nbsp;</p><p>During the meeting, staff members discussed the next steps with refining
  cost estimates and evaluating revenue options aimed at funding climate resilience
  and mitigation efforts, with further details expected to be discussed in the next
  budget cycle for 2027-28. The plan and other materials are available in the meeting
  materials and the <a href=\"https://bellevue.legistar.com/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=7698172&amp;GUID=03B34AD5-A1DE-4CF5-9C6D-1153B22E0EA4\"><span>meeting

  class=\"lead\">2026 legislative agenda</p><p>In other business, the council made
  several amendments to the draft 2026 State Legislative Agenda that was presented
  for feedback and potential adoption. The agenda is meant to clearly communicate
  Bellevue’s state-level policy positions ahead of the next session of the Washington
  State Legislature in January 2026. &nbsp;</p><p>Bellevue’s draft agenda highlights
  key priorities such as addressing the affordable housing crisis, how Bellevue will
  evaluate taxing proposals or budget adjustments, allowing employer shuttles in certain
  transit lanes, funding transportation projects, and supporting digital permitting
  improvements. The areas highlighted in the State Legislative Agenda cover a broad
  set of issues that are aligned with the council’s Strategic Target Areas focused
  on key community outcomes.</p><p>Councilmembers voted unanimously to accept amendments
  to the draft Legislative Agenda. Amendments included strongly urging the Legislature
  to avoid tax proposals that would put the state at a competitive disadvantage, requesting
  future state support for the Grand Connection Crossing, advocating for local flexibility
  to meet the unique needs of our community, expressing concerns about the potential
  impacts of a retail delivery fee, and refinements to state regulatory requirements
  to support residential projects.&nbsp;<br><br>The 2026 legislative session will
  begin on Jan. 12 and last 60 days. The work of the state Legislature affects the

  cornerstone of accessible, culturally responsive city services since its pilot launch

  helped community members navigate government systems and connect with essential
  resources, particularly for those facing language, economic or cultural barriers.&nbsp;<br><br>Following
  the council’s 2023 priority to expand the program, the city secured a state grant
  and approved a 10-year lease for an upgraded facility. The new space opened in May
  2024, coinciding with Mini City Hall’s 30th anniversary. The larger location has
  strengthened partnerships with community organizations and expanded access to services
  such as financial coaching, health insurance enrollment, housing assistance and
  digital literacy support. Services are now offered in 10 languages, further enhancing
  accessibility for Bellevue’s diverse community.<br><br>In 2024, Mini City Hall assisted
  more than 15,000 people and responded to over 49,000 requests. Approximately 70%
  of those requests were related to human services and nearly half required language
  or cultural support. Staff report growing demand and increasingly complex needs
  in areas including financial insecurity, affordable housing and homelessness, access
  to health care and legal resources, employment readiness, and small business support.</p><p>As
  Bellevue’s population and community needs evolve, Mini City Hall continues to adapt
  and remains a resilient, trusted resource that helps community members better navigate

  in King County’s Public Benefit Rating System, which provides property tax reductions
  for preserving open space and natural areas. The council voted to deny the application,
  finding it did not meet the criteria for enrollment. An application for the same
  property was denied by the council in 2022. The full discussion and vote are available

On October 14, 2025, the Bellevue City Council unanimously adopted the 2026-2030 Sustainable Bellevue Plan, marking the second major update since its original approval in 2021. This plan aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, featuring strategies focused on climate change, energy, mobility, waste, and natural systems. Key actions include expanding the Energy Smart Eastside program and promoting building decarbonization.

The council also amended the draft 2026 State Legislative Agenda, which addresses affordable housing, transportation funding, and digital permitting improvements. It strongly urges the Legislature to avoid tax proposals detrimental to the state’s competitiveness and requests support for local projects.

Additionally, the council received an update on Mini City Hall, which has provided accessible city services since 1994. A new facility opened in May 2024, enhancing access to services for more than 15,000 people in 2024 alone. The council denied an application for property enrollment in King County’s Public Benefit Rating System, determining it did not meet the necessary criteria. Lastly, proclamations were made for Arbor Day on October 18 and Hindu American Awareness and Appreciation Month.
