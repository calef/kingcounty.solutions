On October 14, 2025, the Bellevue City Council unanimously adopted the 2026-2030 Sustainable Bellevue Plan, marking the second major update since its original approval in 2021. This plan aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, featuring strategies focused on climate change, energy, mobility, waste, and natural systems. Key actions include expanding the Energy Smart Eastside program and promoting building decarbonization.

The council also amended the draft 2026 State Legislative Agenda, which addresses affordable housing, transportation funding, and digital permitting improvements. It strongly urges the Legislature to avoid tax proposals detrimental to the state’s competitiveness and requests support for local projects.

Additionally, the council received an update on Mini City Hall, which has provided accessible city services since 1994. A new facility opened in May 2024, enhancing access to services for over 15,000 people in 2024 alone. The council denied an application for property enrollment in King County’s Public Benefit Rating System, determining it did not meet the necessary criteria. Lastly, proclamations were made for Arbor Day on October 18 and Hindu American Awareness and Appreciation Month.
