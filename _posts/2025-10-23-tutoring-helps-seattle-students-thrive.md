  <p>With the leaves changing and temperatures dropping, students are settling into the school&nbsp;year. Our Seattle-based Youth Tutoring Program is&nbsp;reflecting on a productive summer of learning and adventure and celebrating a successful start to the new school year.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>The Catholic Community Services&nbsp;<a href="https://ccsww.org/services/youth-tutoring-program-ytp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Youth Tutoring Program</a>&nbsp;(YTP) provides academic support and mentorship to more than 300 students living in low-income and public housing in Seattle. More than 200&nbsp;volunteers&nbsp;including high school students, college students, and&nbsp;adults tutor scholars, helping them achieve academic success and build confidence.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>For more than 30 years, YTP has been&nbsp;guiding and inspiring&nbsp;scholars to attain measurable improvements in school and beyond.&nbsp;Across YTP scholars,&nbsp;95 percent of parents&nbsp;report&nbsp;improvement or&nbsp;maintained&nbsp;success in reading&nbsp;or&nbsp;math skills.&nbsp;Eighty-eight&nbsp;percent of elementary and 84 percent of high school students&nbsp;report&nbsp;improved academic success or high achievement or improvement in grades and schoolwork. Last year, 100 percent&nbsp;of high school seniors in YTP graduated and are now in college.&nbsp;</p>

  <h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Summer Sets Scholars up for Success</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



  <p>Each summer, the&nbsp;YTP&nbsp;offers a six-week session that&nbsp;builds on&nbsp;scholars’ academic strengths, nurtures curiosity, and keeps the joy of learning alive.&nbsp;The YTP&nbsp;summer program is filled with hands-on STEM experiments, outdoor play, competitive math&nbsp;and&nbsp;science games, and field trips that turn learning into an adventure.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>High school students play an essential role, stepping up as volunteers and paid interns who gain valuable leadership, mentorship, and professional skills while inspiring younger scholars to dream big.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>The summer session can be an opportunity for scholars to grow a love of learning and develop stronger connections with their community.&nbsp;One family shared the transformation they saw in their child with TYP Program Manager Nick Bunda.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p>“Every afternoon, their child returned home beaming, eager to share what they had created and was excited to share about each activity they did during the day. The&nbsp;parent&nbsp;expressed deep gratitude for the confidence, connection, and sense of belonging their child found through YTP,” Nick says.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>The family even shared that they had been considering moving away, but because their child discovered such joy and purpose through the program, they were now thinking about wanting to stay and be around the community.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>“This is more than a story about summer learning,” Nick says.&nbsp;“It is a story about families staying rooted, communities growing stronger, and possibilities expanding, one scholar at a time.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

The Catholic Community Services Youth Tutoring Program (YTP) in Seattle provides vital academic support and mentorship to over 300 students from low-income and public housing. Celebrating its 30-year legacy, YTP relies on more than 200 volunteers, including high school and college students, to help scholars improve in reading and math. Reports show that 95% of parents note positive changes in their children's academic performance, with 100% of last year's high school seniors graduating and continuing their education. 

During the summer, YTP hosts a six-week program focused on hands-on STEM activities, outdoor play, and field trips, fostering a love for learning among students. This program not only enhances academic skills but also strengthens community ties, as demonstrated by a family's gratitude for their child's transformation and newfound sense of belonging. As the school year resumes, YTP offers after-school tutoring four days a week, incorporating new curriculum software to further personalize learning experiences. With the continuous support from the community, YTP empowers students to thrive and reach their full potential.
