The Catholic Community Services Youth Tutoring Program (YTP) in Seattle provides vital academic support and mentorship to over 300 students from low-income and public housing. Celebrating its 30-year legacy, YTP relies on more than 200 volunteers, including high school and college students, to help scholars improve in reading and math. Reports show that 95% of parents note positive changes in their children's academic performance, with 100% of last year's high school seniors graduating and continuing their education. 

During the summer, YTP hosts a six-week program focused on hands-on STEM activities, outdoor play, and field trips, fostering a love for learning among students. This program not only enhances academic skills but also strengthens community ties, as demonstrated by a family's gratitude for their child's transformation and newfound sense of belonging. As the school year resumes, YTP offers after-school tutoring four days a week, incorporating new curriculum software to further personalize learning experiences. With the continuous support from the community, YTP empowers students to thrive and reach their full potential.
