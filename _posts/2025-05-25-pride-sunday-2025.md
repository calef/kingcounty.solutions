  <h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Join us for Pride Sunday!</strong></h3>



  <p>Join us for Pride Sunday worship at 10:00am on June 29 (note the time change for this Sunday only!). This event is a chance to celebrate and affirm the LGBTQIA+ members of our community and to make a public statement about the care, love, and appreciation we have for each unique individual expressing their God-given identity.</p>



  <p>This service will include a special address by Gabrielle Claiborne of Transformation Journeys Worldwide, speaking on the topic, “For Such a Time as This: Speaking Truth to Power thru Heart Allyship.” We will be joined by other local United Methodist congregations, as well as other area churches that wish to attend.</p>



  <h3 class="wp-block-heading"><br><strong>Seattle Pride 2025 Theme is “LOUDER”&nbsp;</strong></h3>



  <p>In making the announcement, Seattle Pride Executive Director Patti Hearn explained that “Louder” is a celebration of those who paved the way before us, of voices that shattered silence and demanded change. It honors those who continue to stand defiantly in the face of hatred. It is a promise to carry that legacy forward, to amplify every story and every truth within our community. It is a reminder that our joy, our love, and our resilience are acts of care — for ourselves and for those who come after us.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>“This is not a time to be quiet. This is not a time to acquiesce to extracting a list of words from our vocabulary. It is not a time to be a bystander or to allow others to stand by while bullies — those who were elected and those who were not — try to harm us. Try to erase us. Try to silence us. We’re not going to let that happen, said Hearn. “We will stand up. We will speak up. We will get loud.”&nbsp;</p>
