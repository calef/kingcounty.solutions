Join First Church for Pride Sunday worship at 10:00 AM on June 29, featuring a special address by Gabrielle Claiborne from Transformation Journeys Worldwide, discussing “For Such a Time as This: Speaking Truth to Power thru Heart Allyship.” This event celebrates and affirms LGBTQIA+ individuals, emphasizing care and appreciation for their identities. The Seattle Pride 2025 theme is “LOUDER,” highlighting the importance of honoring those who fought for change and continue to advocate against hatred. Patti Hearn, Seattle Pride Executive Director, stresses the need to speak up against bullying and erasure, declaring, “We will stand up. We will speak up. We will get loud.” Attendees can enjoy cookies, snacks, water, and Holy Communion while passing by the church on their way to PrideFest at Seattle Center. Volunteers will be provided lunch in Fellowship Hall after the service. Free parking is available for worship attendees and volunteers at the church's garage located at Denny Way and Warren Ave North.
