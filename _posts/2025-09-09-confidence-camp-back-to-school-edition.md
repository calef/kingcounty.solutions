  a new school year approaches, many kids experience a whirlwind of mixed emotions.
  While some might be excited about returning to school, others are anxious at the
  thought of navigating structured routines, peer interactions, new teachers, or schoolwork.\n\nIn
  response, the Encompass Pediatric Therapy team put their heads together to create
  **Confidence Camp: Back to School Edition**. Meeting the week before school started,
  this interactive group therapy adventure had a big impact on our kids! Over five
  sessions, children worked with 19 therapists from Mental Health, Speech Therapy,
  and Occupational Therapy, each contributing to an immersive, fun, and effective
  experience. The camp was carefully designed to help kids not only build emotional
  resilience but also equip them with the skills needed for a smoother transition
  into school.\n\nHere’s a glimpse into their journey:\n\n![](https://encompassnw.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-1-300x225.jpg)
  **Session 1: Saying Goodbye to Summer & Preparing for Change**  \nThe camp kicked
  off by helping kids reflect on the joys of summer, while gently preparing them for
  the changes ahead. Through art, story-sharing, and emotional recognition exercises,
  kids were encouraged to identify and label their feelings, whether excited, nervous,
  or sad. Therapists supported them in expressing these emotions, fostering an environment
  of comfort and understanding. Sensory tools and relaxation techniques were also
  introduced to help kids manage their anxieties and feel grounded when things change.\n\n**Session
  2: Back-to-School Routines**  \nNext, it was all about routines! Kids practiced
  structuring their mornings and evenings using visual schedules, which helped them
  understand the predictability of their day. The group engaged in games and social
  stories that focused on creating structure, learning how to manage transitions,
  and navigating unexpected changes. All of these are skills they’ll carry with them
  throughout the school year. Each camper took home their own personalized visual
  schedule.\n\n**Session 3: Friendship & Communication Skills**  \nMaking friends
  and communicating effectively can sometimes be tricky. This session offered playful
  ways to build confidence. The kids participated in activities like Friendship Bingo
  and role-playing scenarios, practicing conversation starters, and learning how to
  cooperate during group activities. Therapists worked on social initiation, choices,
  turn-taking, and empathetic listening, helping kids feel more comfortable approaching
  and connecting with their peers. Several kids reported that their favorite part
  of camp was “making friends”!\n\n**![](https://encompassnw.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-3-300x225.jpg)Session
  4: Coping with Worry & Big Feelings**  \nThis session was all about empowering kids
  to manage their emotions and face worries head-on. The children created their own
  “worry monsters” to help externalize their anxieties. Therapists introduced calming
  tools such as breathing exercises, fidget toys, and grounding techniques to help
  children regulate their emotions. They also practiced identifying and expressing
  their feelings, which is an essential skill for emotional health.\n\n**![](https://encompassnw.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-2-300x225.jpg)Session
  5: Problem-Solving at School**  \nFinally, the kids explored how to tackle problems
  that may arise in school, whether it’s a lost pencil or a friend who’s upset with
  you. Through role-playing and hands-on challenges, such as organizing a messy table
  of school supplies, kids learned how to use problem-solving frameworks and manage
  stress during overwhelming situations. The camp wrapped up with kids taking home
  their own coping cards to remember how to handle challenges in the future.\n\nWe
  are proud of how this collaborative approach from multiple disciplines created such
  a lasting impact on Encompass kids. From the tactile sensory supports provided by
  our occupational therapists to the communication strategies from our speech therapists,
  or the emotional validation from our mental health therapists, every part of camp
  helped build well-rounded emotional resilience. We’re excited to offer more topic-based
  Confidence Camps in the future, allowing kids to continue to grow emotionally, socially,
  and physically, as they become more confident in managing life’s challenges.\n\n**Next
  Up: Confidence Camp: Halloween Edition**\n\n**Get ready for a spooktacular time
  at Confidence Camp: Halloween Edition!**\n\n![](https://encompassnw.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CC-Halloween-image-300x200.jpg)Join
  us on October 30th from 4:15-5:15 pm, or October 31st from 2:00-3:00 pm, for a fun-filled
  group therapy session focused on boosting confidence through Halloween-themed activities.
  Whether it’s practicing relational skills, building self-esteem, or mastering the
  art of the perfect costume compliment, your child will leave feeling ready to take
  on the world.\n\nAfter the session, we’ll have a practice Trick or Treating session
  at the Encompass Child Development Center, where kids can apply their newfound confidence
  in a safe, festive environment. Don’t miss out on this fun, confidence-boosting
  therapeutic adventure and register quickly, as spots will be limited!\n\n**Learn
