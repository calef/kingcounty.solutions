Encompass Pediatric Therapy organized a 'Confidence Camp: Back to School Edition' to help children transition smoothly into a new school year. The camp, which included 19 therapists from mental health, speech therapy, and occupational therapy disciplines, was designed to build emotional resilience in children and equip them with essential skills. Over five sessions, children learned to express their emotions, structure daily routines, communicate effectively, cope with worries, and solve problems. The camp was well-received, with many children citing "making friends" as their favorite part. Encompass plans to offer more topic-based Confidence Camps in the future.
