  <p>The <a href="https://www.commerce.wa.gov/wsbo/">Washington State Broadband Office (WSBO)</a> infrastructure team recently toured <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=d66c091d59b5f448&amp;rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS1175US1175&amp;cs=0&amp;q=Broadband+Infrastructure+Program+%28BIP%29&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiYzLeH0IiQAxXqOTQIHSSKD4UQxccNegQIAhAB&amp;mstk=AUtExfDG0bubAq_C3cs5VTL8wuy1nHbqkob_DRQYYQtSLPa8nxjH_P61dlEhwgX0dXGOHZGxfBn12hYAIrcm4ype-CWJ2ZVlu7L_s04QiWvXwTzenH0fiWqmbJzEuzl6jxE6tSsnO-lyREpKB7jcY-iWFu8Q_VHNWi_9tPMB9Y10le2xPmpzzQPMFzLgrod3k43vxrH_&amp;csui=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Broadband Infrastructure Program (BIP)</a> projects across the state to monitor the critical work connecting rural communities to high-speed internet.</p>



  <p>“Broadband is no longer something communities can do without,” said WSBO Interim Director Joseph Williams. “The funding we distributed across the state will be transformational for these communities as they use these new connections to access jobs, health care, education, and all the other benefits broadband internet can bring.”</p>



  <p>The BIP is a $283 million grant program launched by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) in 2021 to fund partnerships between states and internet service providers to deploy broadband infrastructure in un- and underserved areas.&nbsp;The program expands internet access areas without service, with projects focusing on building backhaul, middle, and last-mile networks.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>WSBO awarded $30 million in BIP last-mile fiber and last-mile wireless grants in July 2022 to rural service providers in Ferry, Jefferson, Kittitas, Okanogan and Stevens counties. That work is now resulting in connections going live. All of the BIP grant work is expected to be completed in 2026.</p>

  <p class="has-small-font-size">WSBO staff, including Broadband Infrastructure Programs Manager Jason Freeze, Broadband Infrastructure and Finance Manager Chelsi Wickersham, and NTIA monitoring staff William Dixon and Geoff Jordan, visited a rural broadband site in Ellensburg with NoaNet and City of Ellensburg staff.</p>



  <p>The City of Ellensburg’s Fiber Extension and Fixed Wireless Broadband project will help eliminate the broadband gap in rural Kittitas County. With $438,000 in grant funding and a local match of $145,000, this initiative is set to bring high-speed internet to nearly 500 unserved households northwest of the city limits. This investment marks a significant step in the City of Ellensburg’s commitment to providing modern connectivity across the greater Kittitas County area.</p>



  <p>The project is a hybrid deployment, combining the high capacity of a fiber-optic backbone with the expansive reach of fixed wireless technology.</p>



  <p><strong>Project scope and infrastructure</strong></p>



  <p>The project&#8217;s core involves extending the city&#8217;s fiber-optic network to power a new wireless base station.</p>



  <ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li><strong>Fiber backhaul:</strong> A new five-mile stretch of 96-count fiber will be constructed, extending from the existing city fiber network to a wireless broadband radio site at the city&#8217;s water well, about five miles northwest of Ellensburg. This route was chosen to leverage existing city-owned easements and infrastructure, streamlining deployment and reducing costs. Crucially, the excess capacity of the 96-count fiber will ensure that future fiber services can be extended to other unserved areas in the county.</li>



  <li><strong>Fixed wireless deployment:</strong> A 110-foot tower will be erected at a water well site to facilitate 360-degree wireless coverage. This tower will host the radio equipment, using the new fiber connection for high-capacity backhaul.</li>



  <li><strong>Last-mile connection:</strong> The network will utilize wireless links from the base station to connect remote premise devices at identified households in the service area.</li>
  </ul>



  <p><strong>Public-private partnership for service delivery</strong></p>



  <p>The City of Ellensburg will retain ownership of the network infrastructure. It partnered with Central Connect LLC, a local Internet Service Provider (ISP), to manage and deliver the fixed wireless broadband service to residents.</p>



  <p>Central Connect LLC will operate the fixed wireless stations on frequencies ranging from 3.65 to 80 GHz. These stations are designed for scalability and serve varying capacities from several hundred subscribers to small remote stations, with expansion contingent on backhaul capabilities.</p>



  <p><strong>High-speed service for rural residents</strong></p>



  <p>The new infrastructure will deliver high-speed symmetrical service, significantly improving connectivity for the targeted rural community:</p>



  <ul class="wp-block-list">
  <li><strong>Fiber connection:</strong> Households located directly along the new five-mile fiber run will be able to connect to ultra-fast symmetrical speeds of up to 1 Gbps.</li>



  <li><strong>Wireless connection:</strong> Households connected via the fixed wireless service will receive minimum symmetrical speeds of 50 Mbps, a substantial leap for residents currently classified as unserved.</li>
