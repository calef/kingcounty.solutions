This week, King County Solutions published 9 posts, highlighting critical updates that affect our community. With the ongoing government shutdown impacting vital services, particularly SNAP benefits, community support is more crucial than ever. Additionally, we focus on health regulations, civic engagement opportunities, and honoring community leaders, all of which are essential for fostering a resilient and connected community.

### Community Support Amid Government Shutdown
The government shutdown has significant implications for SNAP benefits, as detailed in [Hopelink's post](https://www.hopelink.org/blog/what-to-know-about-snap-benefits-and-the-government-shutdown/). Starting November 1, the Washington Department of Social & Human Services will be unable to administer these benefits, potentially affecting nearly 1 million residents. In response, Hopelink is preparing to expand its food markets to assist those in need and is calling for community support through donations and volunteering.

To further aid those facing food insecurity, Hopelink has compiled a list of [food assistance resources](https://www.hopelink.org/blog/food-assistance-resources/) available across King County. This includes various community partners offering groceries and meals, ensuring that help is accessible to all who need it.

### Health and Safety Regulations in Focus
The Washington Department of Health has issued a notice regarding the potential denial of a license application for Peninsula Counseling due to regulatory issues. This situation underscores the importance of compliance in behavioral health services, as detailed in their [official announcement](https://doh.wa.gov/newsroom/department-health-issues-notice-intent-deny-license-application-behavioral-health-agency). Peninsula Counseling has 28 days to respond to the allegations, and updates will be provided as the situation develops.

In light of the upcoming flood season, the [King County Flood Control District](https://kingcountyfloodcontrol.org/%f0%9f%8e%83-dont-get-spooked-by-flood-season-be-flood-ready-this-halloween/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=%25f0%259f%258e%2583-dont-get-spooked-by-flood-season-be-flood-ready-this-halloween) is urging residents to prepare. With flooding being the most common natural disaster in the area, residents are advised to understand their flood risk and take necessary precautions.

### Civic Engagement and Community Events
The City of Burien is hosting an [ADA Transition Plan Open House](https://www.burienwa.gov/cms/One.aspx?portalId=11046019&pageId=20801695) on November 19, inviting community members to discuss pedestrian mobility and accessibility needs. This event is an excellent opportunity for residents to engage with local government and voice their concerns.

Additionally, the [King Conservation District](https://kingcd.org/november-4-2025-board-of-supervisors-meeting-agenda-2/) will hold a Board of Supervisors meeting on November 4. This hybrid event allows for both in-person and remote participation, encouraging community involvement in conservation efforts.

### Honoring Community Leaders
The Snoqualmie Indian Tribe is honoring the life of Tribal Elder Arlene Ventura with memorial services scheduled for November 5 and 6. The community is invited to pay their respects, as detailed in the [Snoqualmie Tribe's announcement](https://snoqualmietribe.us/we-respectfully-share-these-details-about-the-upcoming-services-for-tribal-elder-arlene-ventura/).

Furthermore, the [Sunshine Garden](https://cisc-seattle.org/sunshine-garden-activity-schedule-november/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=sunshine-garden-activity-schedule-november) has released its activity schedule for November, providing culturally relevant programs for older adults that promote wellness and socialization.

### Other updates
In addition to the main themes, the King Conservation District has published the [minutes from the September 9 Board of Supervisors meeting](https://kingcd.org/september-09-2025-board-of-supervisors-meeting-minutes/), although specific details regarding the discussions are not provided.
