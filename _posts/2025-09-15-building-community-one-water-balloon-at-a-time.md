Joy returned to Solid Ground's Sand Point Housing this summer as youth programs resumed, fostering laughter and community connections after pandemic disruptions. The Sand Point campus supports nearly 200 families, including over 130 children, offering not just housing but also essential services like personalized case management and strengths-based youth programs.

Summer activities, designed for both residents and the broader community, included cooking classes, a dance series, bike workshops, and partnerships with local museums for hands-on learning. Events like the National Night Out and Friday night creative workshops have become highlights, encouraging engagement and self-expression among the youth.

A new teen space promotes healing and belonging, providing a safe environment for artistic exploration and emotional support. Programming incorporates mental health resources, helping children build social-emotional skills and confidence. Parents have noted positive changes in their children's behavior and connections.

Older youth are stepping into leadership roles, mentoring younger peers and co-creating community events, fostering a sense of responsibility and pride. With continued support from partners, Solid Ground aims to expand mentorship opportunities and safe spaces, emphasizing the importance of community in youth development.
