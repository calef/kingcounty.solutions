The Seattle City Council’s budget committee has unanimously approved the 2026 budget, which features record investments aimed at enhancing safety and affordability for working families. The budget includes $349.5 million for affordable housing—more than five times what was invested in 2019—and additional funding for rental and tenant assistance. It allocates $11.8 million for new shelter and emergency housing, $2 million for support for individuals living in vehicles, and funds for programs assisting runaway and homeless youth.

In response to food insecurity, the budget adds $4 million to combat a federal food emergency and supports food banks, seniors, and farmers markets in food deserts. Public safety investments include funding for mobile drug treatment teams, a new recruit class for the Seattle Fire Department, and hiring plans for the Seattle Police Department, which aims to bring on over 170 new officers.

Additionally, the budget increases the 'Rainy Day' Fund by $4.7 million and sets aside $14 million to shield the city from potential federal cuts. The budget will be voted on by the full City Council before being sent to Mayor Harrell for approval.
