A delegation from eight countries recently visited Bellevue as part of the SelectUSA Seattle Spinoff, organized by Greater Seattle Partners. This initiative aimed to attract global business investments to the region to foster economic growth. Bellevue, which boasts an annual GDP of $139 billion, is the second largest economy in Washington and plays a critical role in regional job creation. The visiting companies, representing sectors such as aerospace, artificial intelligence, cleantech, and manufacturing, are exploring options for establishing a North American presence or partnering with local businesses. Notable regional employers, including Amazon and Microsoft, participated in the tours. Key activities included a panel discussion at T-Mobile’s Tech Experience 5G Hub, where representatives from Xplore, Lithos Carbon, and T-Mobile discussed Bellevue's competitive advantages. Mayor Lynne Robinson emphasized Bellevue's supportive ecosystem for businesses, highlighting its strong infrastructure and proactive government. This is the second consecutive year that downtown Bellevue has served as the base for the SelectUSA Seattle Spinoff, showcasing the region's diverse industries and opportunities for international investment, according to Brian Surratt, President and CEO of Greater Seattle Partners.
