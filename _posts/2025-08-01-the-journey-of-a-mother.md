After a challenging journey, Durga, a widow from India, relocated to the US to be with her daughters following the unexpected death of her husband, Kishan. She arrived with just $200 and little knowledge of the English language. With assistance from the Indian American Community Services (IACS), Durga moved into an apartment, found employment, and began studying English at a community college. Despite the struggles and loneliness, Durga expresses gratitude for the opportunities she's had in the US and the progress she's made. She now assists a sous chef and dreams of learning to drive while her daughters pursue their college education.
