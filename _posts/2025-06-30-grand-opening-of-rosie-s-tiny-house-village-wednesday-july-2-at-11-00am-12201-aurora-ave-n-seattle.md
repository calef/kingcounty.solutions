LIHI has announced the grand opening of Rosie’s Village, a tiny house village located at 12201 Aurora Ave N, Seattle. Originally situated in the University District, the new site features 37 tiny houses designed for individuals experiencing homelessness. The village will offer 24/7 staffing, a community kitchen, bathrooms, laundry facilities, and offices for case managers. It aims to provide a pathway to permanent housing for 40-50 unsheltered individuals, with on-site case managers assisting with identification, income support, healthcare, and employment services. Located near public transit and essential amenities, Rosie’s Village is sponsored by Truevine of Holiness Missionary Baptist Church in partnership with LIHI. Each tiny house measures 8’ x 12’ and is equipped with electricity, heating, and air conditioning, all within a secured fenced area. LIHI plans to establish a Community Advisory Council to engage local residents and business owners in oversight and input. The project is part of a broader effort to address homelessness in King County, where over 9,000 individuals are unsheltered. LIHI, a nonprofit committed to affordable housing, currently operates 14 tiny house villages and has helped 1,415 people transition into tiny houses in 2024.
