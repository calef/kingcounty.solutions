  <h3>Boys &amp; Girls Clubs Summer Camps help kids grow and have fun by exploring the outdoors, building self-confidence and independence, learning core values, developing life skills, and—most importantly—being active.</h3>
  <h3>Each week, imaginative themes and activities provide an engaging atmosphere for hands-on learning and exploration. While camp is packed with fun activities, we also make sure to supply enough choice time that gives kids the chance to build new friendships or simply hang out with their favorite counselor.</h3>
  <h3>Although each camp varies, you can expect these types of activities throughout the summer.</h3>
