Boys & Girls Clubs Summer Camps offer children an enriching experience through outdoor exploration, skill development, and active play. Each week features imaginative themes and structured activities that promote hands-on learning and social interaction. A typical day starts at 7:00 am with Arrival and Choice Time, allowing campers to engage in structured free time. At 9:30 am, campers participate in group meetings and icebreakers to foster connections. By 10:00 am, they engage in group outside games designed to enhance teamwork and communication. At 10:45 am, Summer Brain Gain activities, including journaling and math games, keep minds active over the summer. After a lunch break at 11:45 am, the afternoon from 12:30 pm to 4:00 pm is filled with various activities such as water play, crafts, and field trips. The day concludes at 4:00 pm with Extended Camp, allowing for further exploration of interests. This structured yet flexible schedule promotes independence, creativity, and friendships among campers, ensuring a memorable summer experience.
