Christine Meredith, a mother of a neurodivergent child and founder of Mosaic Montessori, partnered with Encompass Child Care Health Consultation (CCHC) to provide support for neurodivergent children. The Encompass Community-Based Services (CBS) program provides therapy services in a child's natural environment and reduces access barriers. Initially starting with two-days-a-week visits, Encompass expanded to four days, with over half of Mosaic's students receiving services. The program fosters collaboration between therapists and educators, leading to personalized support strategies. Benefits of CBS include normalization of therapy and enhanced support for neurodivergent students, making Mosaic Montessori a refuge for many.
