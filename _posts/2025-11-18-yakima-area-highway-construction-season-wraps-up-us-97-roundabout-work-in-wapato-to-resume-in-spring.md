The 2025 highway construction season in the Yakima Valley is concluding, with the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) completing projects on US 12 near Rimrock and State Route 821 in East Selah. Construction at the US 97 and Lateral A intersection in Wapato will pause for winter and resume in spring 2026. Contractor crews started building a new roundabout on US 97 in September, with all southbound lanes open and operating through the partially finished roundabout, while northbound lanes remain in a two-lane configuration. Access to the business center west of the highway is fully available, allowing northbound travelers to turn left onto Lateral A. The roundabout project, part of a collaboration between WSDOT and the Yakama Nation, aims to enhance safety along the US 97 corridor from Union Gap to Toppenish, marking the third roundabout in this area. Additional work included repairing an embankment on US 12 near Rimrock Lake and repaving sections along SR 821. The Lateral A roundabout project is expected to be completed by summer 2026.
