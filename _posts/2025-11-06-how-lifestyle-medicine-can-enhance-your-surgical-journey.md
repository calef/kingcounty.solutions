Having surgery can be challenging both physically and emotionally, necessitating preparation for both the procedure and recovery. Healthcare professionals increasingly utilize lifestyle medicine, emphasizing exercise, nutrition counseling, diabetes management, and physical therapy, to enhance patients' health prior to surgery and facilitate recovery afterward. Prehabilitation (prehab) is a key component, promoting muscle strengthening and heart health, which leads to quicker recoveries. Research indicates that active patients experience fewer complications and shorter hospital stays.

Diabetes management is also crucial, as high blood sugar levels can impede healing and increase infection risks. Implementing lifestyle changes to maintain stable blood sugar can significantly improve surgical outcomes for diabetic patients. Physical therapy plays an important role in both pre- and post-surgical phases, helping patients enhance mobility, strength, and independence through tailored exercise programs.

By combining exercise, diabetes management, and physical therapy, patients are empowered to take an active role in their health journey. Valley Medical Center incorporates these lifestyle medicine principles into its care, offering comprehensive support that fosters greater confidence and energy, ultimately transforming surgery into a step towards long-term wellness.
