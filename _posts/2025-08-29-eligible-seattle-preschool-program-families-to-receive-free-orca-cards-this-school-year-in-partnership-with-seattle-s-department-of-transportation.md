Eligible families in the Seattle Preschool Program (SPP) will receive free ORCA cards this school year, thanks to a partnership between the Seattle Department of Education and Early Learning (DEEL) and the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT). Funded by the voter-approved Seattle Transit Measure, this initiative aims to alleviate transportation costs for families, helping them access high-quality preschool education. Families whose incomes meet the eligibility criteria will receive their ORCA cards by mail, providing unlimited public transit access until August 31, 2026.

The SPP supports three and four-year-olds in preparing for kindergarten, offering resources such as dual-language classrooms and extended care options. This year, the program has expanded to include nine additional preschool classrooms serving over 160 students. Testimonials from families highlight the significant impact of the ORCA cards, which have allowed them to participate in educational and community events without the burden of transportation costs. The initiative not only enhances preschool attendance but also enriches the family's overall experience by providing opportunities to engage in various activities throughout the city. Families can still enroll in the SPP for the 2025-26 school year and are encouraged to apply.
