Celebrate Arbor Day by planting trees and native plants on Saturday, October 18, from 8:45 a.m. to 11 a.m. at Lewis Creek Park. Community members can register to volunteer in planting native trees such as Sitka spruce, Douglas fir, and western red cedar, helping to restore the park's habitat. Participants will also have the opportunity to remove noxious weeds that threaten forest health. Although Arbor Day is officially recognized on April 25, Bellevue celebrates it in the fall for better planting conditions. Since 2022, the city has transitioned to separate Arbor Day and Earth Day celebrations. Arbor Day was first proposed in 1872 by Julius Morton, aiming to promote tree planting and appreciation. Bellevue’s Sustainable Bellevue plan focuses on preserving and expanding the city's tree canopy, with hundreds of free trees distributed annually. In 2024, Bellevue's City Council implemented new tree preservation and protection codes. With nearly 1.5 million trees, Bellevue's urban forest offers numerous health, environmental, and economic benefits, contributing to the city's character and ecosystem health, providing oxygen, habitat, and cooling effects.
