The King County Water Taxi is offering special service for Vashon residents to attend the Grand Opening Celebration of Waterfront Park in Seattle on Saturday, September 6. This all-day event, organized by Friends of Waterfront Park and the City of Seattle, will feature performances, exhibits, and food across 20 acres of waterfront. The Vashon Water Taxi will operate between the Vashon Ferry Terminal and Seattle’s Pier 50, allowing easy access to the festivities. The schedule includes various sailings throughout the day, with coordination for transfers to Metro Routes 118/119 on Vashon Island. However, there will be no bus service for the last sailing to Vashon and the return trip to Pier 50. The water taxi service aims to thank riders for their support throughout the summer. As of September 1, fares are set at $7.00 for adults ($6.75 with an ORCA card), with free rides for passengers 18 and under, and reduced fares for seniors and those with disabilities or lower incomes.
