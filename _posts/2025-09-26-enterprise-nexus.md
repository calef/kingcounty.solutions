The inaugural Enterprise Nexus event took place in Seattle, organized by WorkSource Seattle King County and the Seattle Public Library, aiming to support Black entrepreneurs and small business owners. The event featured diverse entrepreneurs, business leaders, and resource organizations, emphasizing the importance of community connections and resources. Amanda Williams from Denkyem, a Community Development Financial Institution, pointed out the significance of networking for solo entrepreneurs who often lack a support system. Harpreet Marwah from WorkSource noted a growing interest in entrepreneurship among clients, which inspired the event's creation. Jay Lyman from the Seattle Public Library highlighted the library's historical support for small businesses, offering access to valuable market research databases and expert assistance from librarians. The event aimed to foster connections between attendees and various resource organizations, encouraging entrepreneurs to leave with business cards and personal contacts. Fyniecko Glover Jr. from WorkSource echoed the need for resources to support aspiring entrepreneurs, particularly those struggling in the job market. The event showcased collaboration among organizations like the SBA and CDFIs, with a shared goal of promoting economic mobility and sustainability in the Seattle King County region. Future events are anticipated to continue this support.
