Washington State offers various methods for voter registration, including online, by mail, and in person. To register online, individuals need a valid Washington driver’s license, ID card, or the last four digits of their Social Security number. Registrations must be submitted at least 8 days before Election Day to be counted. For mail registrations, forms must also arrive by this deadline. In-person registration is available until 8 p.m. on Election Day.

Key upcoming election dates include the General Election on November 4, 2025, with an 18-day voting period starting October 17. The deadline for online and mail registration is October 27, while in-person registration is allowed until Election Day.

Additionally, National Voter Registration Day will be observed on September 16, 2025, encouraging voter registration through community events hosted by libraries and organizations. This day serves as a great opportunity for individuals to register or update their information before the general election deadlines. It is advisable for potential voters to plan their registration method and participate in local events for assistance.
