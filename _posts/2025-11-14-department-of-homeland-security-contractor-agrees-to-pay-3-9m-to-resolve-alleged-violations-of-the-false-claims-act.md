title: Department of Homeland Security Contractor Agrees to Pay $3.9M to Resolve Alleged
  Violations of the False Claims Act

Zephyr Aviation LLC, along with its owners Frederick Credno Jr. and Frederick W. Credno III, has agreed to pay $3.9 million to resolve allegations of violating the False Claims Act. The claims stem from accusations that the company submitted inflated invoices for aviation contracts with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The Justice Department indicated that contractors are expected to accurately charge the government for services provided. Assistant Attorney General Brett A. Shumate emphasized the Department's commitment to pursuing individuals who knowingly overcharge taxpayers. This settlement was confirmed by DHS Inspector General Joseph V. Cuffari, who noted the importance of accountability in federal contracts. The allegations specifically relate to contracts where Zephyr provided charter flights for individuals in the custody of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) between 2022 and 2025. Zephyr allegedly invoiced CBP for flight hours that exceeded the actual times flown by the aircraft operators. The resolution was the result of a coordinated investigation involving multiple divisions of the Justice Department and DHS. The claims resolved by this settlement are allegations only, and there has been no determination of liability.
