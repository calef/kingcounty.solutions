  <p>The strength and resilience of Veterans who have faced the challenges of breast cancer were on display at the <a href="https://news.va.gov/?s=Michael+E.+DeBakey+VA+Medical+Center+">Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center</a> at the hospital’s annual October breast cancer survivor celebration. Among the Veterans in attendance was Donna Holman, an Army Veteran who served during Operation Desert Shield. Diagnosed with breast cancer in 2017, Holman’s journey was far from easy; after beating cancer once, she was shocked when she was diagnosed with Stage 3 breast cancer in 2020.</p>



  <p>Reflecting on her experience, Holman credited Dr. Mahdieh Parizi, Chief of Breast Imaging at the <a href="https://www.va.gov/houston-health-care/" rel="noopener">Houston VA</a>, with saving her life. “I remember looking into Dr. Parizi&#8217;s eyes and feeling her caring and compassion,” said Holman, her voice filled with gratitude. “She made all the difference for me.”&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Since being diagnosed with cancer, Holman has embraced diet and exercise as critical parts of her life, taking full advantage of the Whole Health resources offered by VA and proudly taking responsibility for her own health. Now a committed volunteer with the Disabled American Veterans (DAV) where she serves as the chapter president, Holman is committed to giving back to other Veterans. After battling cancer twice, she sees herself as a winner. “I would encourage Veterans to go to Houston VA to fight cancer&#8230; I got exceptional treatment,” she said. “I’m here today because of VA.”</p>

  <p>Joe Miller, her husband, also spoke to the crowd at the breast cancer event, sharing his initial apprehensions about entrusting his wife’s care to VA during the pandemic. “I was very nervous, but I found the staff to be delightful,” he said.

  <p>Dr. Mahdieh Parizi addressed the crowd at the celebration, emphasizing the profound honor she feels working with Veterans at VA. “In breast radiology, we have the privilege of walking alongside patients during the most challenging of times,” she said. “I get to witness their strength and courage.

  <p>Dr. Parizi reaffirmed VA’s commitment to early detection and support for women Veterans, ensuring they receive the care they need every step of the way.</p>

Veterans diagnosed with breast cancer are overcoming challenges through resilience and support from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The VA provides comprehensive care, including access to advanced treatments and support networks, allowing veterans to navigate their journeys effectively. Patients highlight the importance of early detection and regular screenings, which are crucial for successful outcomes. The VA encourages all veterans, particularly women, to prioritize their health by utilizing available resources for screening and treatment. 

Personal stories from veterans emphasize the emotional and physical battles faced during treatment, showcasing their determination to reclaim their lives. Support groups play a vital role, fostering connections among veterans who share similar experiences, thus providing a sense of community and understanding. The VA’s commitment to improving breast cancer care continues to evolve, ensuring that veterans receive the best possible treatment and support. Efforts include increasing awareness and addressing the unique needs of veteran women, ultimately empowering them to triumph over breast cancer.
