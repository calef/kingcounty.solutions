  # Back to School Bash offers relief and resources for Tri-Cities families

Health services included vaccinations administered by Walgreens for 44 individuals and sports physicals for 106 students conducted by medical providers. Over 70 stylists from the Paul Mitchell School provided haircuts to 160 youth and distributed 250 coupons for free haircuts. This event was organized through a collaboration of Lutheran Community Services Northwest, HAPO Community Credit Union, the Tri-Cities Diversity and Inclusion Council, and Sozo Church, with support from 37 vendors and 67 volunteers. Additionally, seven local schools received surprise donations of classroom supplies the following day.
