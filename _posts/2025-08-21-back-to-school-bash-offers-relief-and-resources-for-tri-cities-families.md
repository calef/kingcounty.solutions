On August 18, the HAPO Center in Pasco hosted the annual Back to School Bash, a free community event that supported families in the Tri-Cities as they prepared for the school year. The event served 556 families and 2,475 individuals, marking a 20% increase from the previous year. Attendees received backpacks, school supplies, and access to essential services at no cost. Health services included vaccinations administered by Walgreens for 44 individuals and sports physicals for 106 students conducted by medical providers. Over 70 stylists from the Paul Mitchell School provided haircuts to 160 youth and distributed 250 coupons for free haircuts. This event was organized through a collaboration of Lutheran Community Services Northwest, HAPO Community Credit Union, Tri-Cities Diversity and Inclusion Council, and Sozo Church, with support from 37 vendors and 67 volunteers. Additionally, seven local schools received surprise donations of classroom supplies the following day. Amy Marinoni, Advancement Manager at LCSNW, emphasized the importance of the event in helping families feel prepared and supported as they head back to school. The community's collective efforts made a significant impact on those in need.
