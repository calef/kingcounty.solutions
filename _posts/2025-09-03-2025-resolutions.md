Every year, delegates at the Washington State Labor Council (WSLC) convention engage in discussions and debates on resolutions submitted by affiliated union locals and councils. These resolutions are crucial for setting the policy, programs, and actions of the WSLC. At the 2025 Convention, held in July in Vancouver, WA, delegates passed several resolutions that will guide the organization's initiatives moving forward. A PDF document containing all the resolutions from the 2025 WSLC Convention is available for download.
