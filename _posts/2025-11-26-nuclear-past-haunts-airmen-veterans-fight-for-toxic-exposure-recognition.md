Air Force veteran David Crete and other servicemen from the Nevada Test and Training Range (NTTR) are advocating for recognition of their exposure to toxic substances during their service. Crete developed serious health issues, including a large tumor, which he attributes to contamination from 100 atmospheric nuclear tests conducted at NTTR from 1951 to 1962, followed by 828 underground tests until 1992. Despite their service in a contaminated area, veterans like Crete have not been officially acknowledged as having toxic exposure, leading to denials of disability compensation claims. The PACT Act of 2022 did not address all military toxic exposures, prompting Nevada Senators Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto to introduce the FORGOTTEN Veterans Act (S. 2220). This legislation seeks to expand recognition of toxic exposure and establish new presumptions of service connection for veterans who served at NTTR. DAV National Commander Coleman Nee emphasized the need for this bill to ensure justice for veterans affected by past nuclear testing, aiming to alleviate their struggles in accessing healthcare and benefits.
