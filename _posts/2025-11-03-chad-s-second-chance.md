Chad, a former U.S. Marine Corps mechanic, faced severe challenges after developing a substance use disorder linked to a heavy drinking culture during his military service. Despite excelling academically at the National Aviation Academy, his addiction spiraled out of control, leading to a tragic DUI incident that resulted in a fatal motorcycle accident and subsequent imprisonment. After experiencing two suicide attempts, Chad was hospitalized at the VA Hospital in Danville, Illinois, where he found support through a therapeutic housing and work program, marking the beginning of his recovery.

Through hard work, Chad secured a full-time job as a custodial worker at the VA Hospital and was soon promoted to work leader. The last piece of his recovery journey was finding stable housing, which he achieved by moving into Cannon Place, a community for veterans, located just minutes from his job. This proximity is vital as Chad cannot drive due to his DUI. Now, he is focused on rebuilding his life, contributing to his veteran community, and enjoying a stable home with his girlfriend and two therapy cats. Chad hopes his story will inspire others to learn from his past mistakes and prevent similar tragedies.
