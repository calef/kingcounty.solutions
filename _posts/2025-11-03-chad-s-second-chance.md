  At an early age, Chad enjoyed taking things apart and putting them back together. It’s no surprise that when he entered the U.S. Marine Corps, he was assigned to work on CH53C Stallion helicopters as an engine mechanic. “We tore them down, rebuilt them and tested them, and then they would be installed on the aircraft…I enjoyed it thoroughly,” reflected Chad on his military service.

  Chad proudly served in the Marines for five years and was honorably discharged. Unfortunately, being exposed to a heavy drinking culture led him to develop a substance use disorder that followed him long after his military service. Despite graduating from top of his class at the National Aviation Academy of Clearwater, Florida, he drank heavily and lost control of his life. “I thought I could drink and control it and was lucky enough to get through life without repercussions, but my luck only lasted so long.”

  Tragically, his drinking eventually led to severe consequences. “I got a DUI where I was involved in a collision with a motorcycle and the man lost his life. It was my fault, and I went to prison for a while.”

  When he reentered society, Chad felt hopeless, began drinking again, and attempted to end his life on two occasions. After being hospitalized at the VA Hospital in Danville, Illinois, he received support from a therapeutic housing and work program, which began his recovery journey.

  ## A purpose driven life

  Chad’s hard work and determination in the program led to full-time employment as a custodial worker at the VA Hospital in Danville. “I’m doing good working. I got promoted to work leader less than a year after I got promoted full-time. As soon as supervisor [position] comes open, I’m pretty much the guy for that.” The only missing piece in his continued recovery was a stable, permanent home.

  Fortunately, Chad was able to move out of the therapeutic housing program and into a permanent home at Cannon Place, a Mercy Housing Lakefront community for formerly homeless and at-risk veterans on the campus of the VA Hospital in Danville, Illinois – just a three-minute walk to his new job! Because Chad is unable to get a driver’s license due to his DUI, the short commute to his job is not only convenient, but also essential for his independence and mental health.

  With help from generous supporters, Chad has a second chance at building a purpose-driven life. He is helping to strengthen his veteran community through his work at the hospital, building a life with his girlfriend, and proudly raising two therapy cats.

  Chad is grateful for the opportunity to share his story and hopes that people will learn from his past mistakes, preventing future tragedy from occurring.

Chad, a former U.S. Marine Corps mechanic, faced severe challenges after developing a substance use disorder linked to a heavy drinking culture during his military service. Despite excelling academically at the National Aviation Academy, his addiction spiraled out of control, leading to a tragic DUI incident that resulted in a fatal motorcycle accident and subsequent imprisonment. After experiencing two suicide attempts, Chad was hospitalized at the VA Hospital in Danville, Illinois, where he found support through a therapeutic housing and work program, marking the beginning of his recovery.

Through hard work, Chad secured a full-time job as a custodial worker at the VA Hospital and was soon promoted to work leader. The last piece of his recovery journey was finding stable housing, which he achieved by moving into Cannon Place, a community for veterans located just minutes from his job. This proximity is vital, as Chad cannot drive due to his DUI. Now, he is focused on rebuilding his life, contributing to his veteran community, and enjoying a stable home with his girlfriend and two therapy cats. Chad hopes his story will inspire others to learn from his past mistakes and prevent similar tragedies.
