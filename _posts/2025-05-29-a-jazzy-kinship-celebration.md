  Bill 5151 which grants DCYF the ability to issue a child-specific license to a relative
  or other suitable person to provide foster care in order to keep children close
  to family in the absence of a parent. A recent victory was also seen in 2024 with

  famed Jazz Alley, the Youth Development &amp; Education Support team turned a classroom
  into a darkened jazz club complete with a local band and singer, red carpet entrance,
  mocktail bar, and table service. We also heard from Youth Development Director Michelle
  Mitchell-Brannon about her passion for the Kinship Care Support Group and its importance.</p><p><img

  &#8211; but she stepped up to care for me just like you with your babies.&#8221;</p><p>Also

At Atlantic Street Center (ASC), recognition is given to older caregivers who face numerous challenges while raising young children. For over thirty years, the Kinship Care Support Group has provided essential resources to families, advocating for kinship care rights, including support for Senate Bill 5151, which allows relatives to foster children. May 21st is now officially recognized as Kinship Caregiver Day in Washington state, celebrating the contributions of these caregivers.

To honor this achievement, ASC hosted a special event featuring jazz music, transforming a classroom into a jazz club with a local band, mocktails, and fine dining. Youth Development Director Michelle Mitchell-Brannon expressed her personal connection to the program, sharing her experience of being raised by her grandmother. Guests included Barbara Taylor from Catholic Community Services and Michael Bailey from Community & Human Services, who emphasized collaboration and support for caregivers.

The celebration also provided attendees with new clothing and accessories, ensuring caregivers felt appreciated. The evening highlighted the importance of kinship care and celebrated the vital role these caregivers play in their families and communities.
