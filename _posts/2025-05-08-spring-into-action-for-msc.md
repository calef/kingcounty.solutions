Not much is certain for MSC amid challenges affecting funding and services for vulnerable community members. As a Community Action agency in Washington state, MSC remains committed to its mission of reducing harm caused by poverty. To continue this work, MSC relies on support from community partners and individuals. The organization is hosting its biggest fundraiser, "Spring into Action," on June 7th. This event will feature a delightful meal, opportunities to learn about MSC’s community initiatives, and a chance to bid on auction items that benefit MSC's programs. Attendees can look forward to enjoying the evening with friends while supporting the organization's efforts. Tickets are currently on sale, and MSC expresses gratitude to everyone who contributes to uplifting communities during these challenging times. The event aims to strengthen relationships and ensure that MSC can continue to serve those in need.
