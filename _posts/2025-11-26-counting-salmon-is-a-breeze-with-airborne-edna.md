  <p>During the annual salmon run last fall, University of Washington researchers pulled salmon DNA out of thin air and used it to estimate the number of fish that passed through the adjacent river. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aden-ip-185100mk/?originalSubdomain=sg">Aden Yincheong Ip</a>, a UW research scientist of marine and environmental affairs, began formulating the driving hypothesis for the study while hiking on the Olympic Peninsula.</p>
  <p>“I saw the fish jumping and the water splashing and I started thinking — could we recover their genetic material from the air?,” he said.</p>
  <p>The researchers placed air filters at several sites on Issaquah Creek, near the Issaquah Salmon Hatchery in Washington.

title: Counting salmon is a breeze with airborne eDNA
topics: []
---

University of Washington researchers have developed a novel method for estimating salmon populations by capturing airborne environmental DNA (eDNA). During the annual salmon run, they placed air filters near Issaquah Creek, successfully collecting DNA from coho salmon even from distances of 10 to 12 feet away from the water. This groundbreaking study, published in *Scientific Reports*, demonstrates that eDNA can transfer between air and water, providing a new approach to tracking aquatic species. By merging air and water eDNA data with visual counts from the hatchery, researchers were able to model salmon population fluctuations during migration. Although airborne eDNA concentrations were significantly lower than those in water, they still correlated with observed migratory trends. This method offers a more remote-friendly option for monitoring salmon populations, eliminating the need for electricity. The researchers plan to explore additional variables such as weather conditions in future studies. This innovative technique has the potential to enhance wildlife management and conservation efforts, pushing the boundaries of current eDNA applications.
