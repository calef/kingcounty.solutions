title: Critical wastewater repairs coming to the cities of Pateros and Wapato
topics: []
---

The Washington State Public Works Board (PWB) has granted $734,310 in emergency loans to Pateros and Wapato for critical infrastructure repairs. In Pateros, a collapsed sewer line under two apartment buildings has caused a sinkhole and building damage, prompting a state of emergency. The PWB has approved $305,000 to install a new sewer line and repair sidewalks. In Wapato, a power outage led to wastewater treatment failure, leaving the city to transport waste off-site. Wapato received a $429,310 loan to replace electrical equipment and evaluate long-term improvements. The PWB still has $6.8 million in emergency funds for the 2025-27 biennium.
