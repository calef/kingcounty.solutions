Seattle police arrested a 42-year-old man with a history of violent behavior for repeatedly harassing a West Seattle travel agency. The harassment included mocking and threatening employees. He violated a court order prohibiting him from approaching the business, which was documented by an employee who obtained an Anti-Harassment Order. During the arrest, police found the suspect within 350 feet of the agency, along with methamphetamine and a warrant for property destruction. He has prior felony convictions for assault, threats, and narcotics violations and was booked into King County Jail.
