At this year’s Celebration of Youth Foster Care event, Autumn Liner-Sanders won the raffle prize of two Diamond Club Mariners tickets. She and a guest enjoyed an exceptional game-day experience right behind home plate. The event was a success, and gratitude was expressed to both the winner and all who purchased raffle tickets. The funds raised through these tickets contribute significantly to supporting youth and families in the community.
