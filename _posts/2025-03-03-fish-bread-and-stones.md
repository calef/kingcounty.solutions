This week, a special worship service is planned as the congregation prepares for an important merger vote. Rev. Derek Nakano, the District Superintendent, will join the gathering to reflect on the biblical story of the loaves and fishes. The focus will be on understanding the significance of this story in the context of the congregation's upcoming decision. Participants are encouraged to contemplate what the teachings of this narrative mean for them on this pivotal day. The service aims to foster a sense of community and shared purpose as they navigate this critical moment in their church's journey.
