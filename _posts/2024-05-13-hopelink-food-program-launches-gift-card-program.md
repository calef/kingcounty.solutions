The grant provided funds to purchase gift cards for clients and food to support the [Bellevue Food Market](https://www.hopelink.org/locations/bellevue/).&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n“When we received the grant, the notion of distributing gift cards from local businesses emerged as an opportunity of choice and diversity for our clients,” said Shelby Chapman, Food Program Coordinator at Hopelink’s Bellevue Food Market.&nbsp;\n\nFrom that idea, the team created a unique gift card program. Instead of providing clients with a gift card from one major retailer, they could get them from local businesses that specialize in culturally relevant food and give clients the chance to find food items they may not find at traditional grocery stores.&nbsp;\n\n![The International Deli offers Eastern European delicacies, like specialty meats, seasonings, and sweets. ](https://www.hopelink.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2024_Bellevue_Food_Team_Story_Square_0002_2024_Bellevue_Food_Team_Story_1-1024x945.jpg \"The International Deli offers Eastern European delicacies, like specialty meats, seasonings, and sweets. \")\n_The International Deli offers Eastern European delicacies, like specialty meats, seasonings, and sweets. (Photo by Antonio Estrada, Hopelink) _\n\n![The International Deli gives folks an authentic experience providing a variety of Eastern European meats and cheeses.](https://www.hopelink.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2024_Bellevue_Food_Team_Story_Square_0005_Layer-0-1024x945.jpg \"The International Deli gives folks an authentic experience providing a variety of Eastern European meats and cheeses. \")\n_The International Deli gives folks an authentic experience providing a variety of Eastern European meats and cheeses.

For 17 years, Ramiro and his brothers have not only nurtured their business but have also woven threads of connection within the community, even amidst the challenges of a fluctuating market.&nbsp;\n\n“Back in 2008, when the economy took a hit, we were cruising around Bellevue and noticed many empty spaces. That’s when the idea of opening a store struck us,” shared Ramiro, speaking in Spanish, reflecting on the evolution of their entrepreneurial journey.&nbsp;\n\nYet, beyond the mere pursuit of business growth—a story of solidarity lies beneath it all. “People started trickling in when several Hispanic businesses shuttered. First, one closed, then another, and folks migrated to us,” said Ramiro.&nbsp;\n\n“At first when Hopelink approached us about the partnership, we were apprehensive. But when they explained how the program would work, we loved the idea,” continued Ramiro. “In reality, the program has really helped us gain new clients and has given us the opportunity to show folks all the variety of products we offer.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n![The Asian Family Market offers a wide selection of Asian-inspired food and sections for produce, meats, and seafood.](https://www.hopelink.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2024_Bellevue_Food_Team_Story_Square_0001_2024_Bellevue_Food_Team_Story_13-1024x945.jpg \"The Asian Family Market offers a wide selection of Asian-inspired food and sections for produce, meats, and seafood. \")\n_The Asian Family Market offers a wide selection of Asian-inspired food and sections for produce, meats, and seafood.

Conveniently located across the street from Hopelink’s Bellevue Center on Main St., The International Deli offers Eastern European delicacies, candies, and staples.&nbsp;\n\n“Our gift card partnership program was impactful on multiple fronts, benefiting both Bellevue clients and the small, multi-cultural businesses we partnered with,” said Hopelink Food Programs Director, Amanda Lopez-Castanon. “It aimed to address unseen challenges faced by these businesses, while also breaking down barriers for Hopelink clients accessing essential, culturally relevant food.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\nAnd in just three days of distributing the cards, all 300 gift cards were accepted by clients, with many of them returning to share their gratitude and appreciation for this special opportunity.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n“Receiving the gift card was extremely helpful,” shared Natalia, a Bellevue client. “I was able to get groceries that my family actually liked, and I appreciated the choice we were given between the different stores and gift cards.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n“The Bellevue Food Market hopes to receive additional funding to continue this program”, says Amanda. “By providing community support and fostering new client relationships, we’ve seen tangible success, and aim to continue to expand this program in the future.”&nbsp;\n\n[_La Superior_](https://www.lasuperiorbellevue.com/) _is located at 900 160th Ave. NE., Bellevue, WA 98008, the_ [_Asian Family Market_](https://www.asianfamilymkt.com/) _is located at 14515 NE. 20th St., and the_ [_International Deli_](https://www.yelp.com/biz/international-deli-bellevue) _is located at 15015 Main St., Bellevue, WA 98007.&nbsp;_&nbsp;\n\n_Interviews with La Superior Owner Ramiro were conducted in Spanish and translated by the writer, a fluent Spanish speaker._&nbsp;\n\n<script defer>\n\t\t(() => {\n\t\t\tlet article = document.querySelector('.block8539279807888439');\n\n\t\t\tarticle.querySelectorAll('a').forEach(elm => {\n\t\t\t\tif (!elm.href.search(/^(http).+(hopelink.com).+$/)) {\n\t\t\t\t\telm.target = '_blank';\n\t\t\t\t\telm.title = 'Opens in a new tab';\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t});\n\t\t})();\n\t</script>\n\n_Hopelink’s_ [_Food Assistance Program_](https://www.hopelink.org/programs/food-program/) _operates five food markets with locations in_ [_Bellevue_](https://www.hopelink.org/locations/bellevue/)_,_ [_Redmond_](https://www.hopelink.org/locations/redmond-market-and-service-center/)_,_ [_Shoreline_](https://www.hopelink.org/locations/shoreline-market-and-service-center/)_,_ [_Kirkland_](https://www.hopelink.org/locations/kirkland-northshore/)_, and_ [_Sno-Valley_](https://www.hopelink.org/locations/sno-valley/)_.

Hopelink, a community organization, has launched a gift card program for its Food Assistance program. The initiative, funded by an American Rescue Plan Act Grant, provides gift cards for local businesses that cater to diverse populations. Three businesses were identified for the program — The International Deli, Asian Family Market, and La Superior. The aim is to offer clients access to culturally relevant food they may not find at traditional grocery stores. All 300 gift cards were accepted by clients in just three days. Hopelink hopes to receive additional funding to continue the program.
