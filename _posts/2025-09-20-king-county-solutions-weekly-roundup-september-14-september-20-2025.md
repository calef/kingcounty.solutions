Additionally, the [Open Doors for Multicultural Families](https://togethercenter.org/2025/09/20/open-doors-for-multicultural-families/) program continues to support families with disabilities, showcasing the development of The Multicultural Village, which will provide inclusive housing and resources.

### Community Engagement and Support
Community support initiatives are thriving, as seen in Hopelink's upcoming [food assistance enhancements](https://www.hopelink.org/blog/from-the-gridiron-to-the-farm/) and the impactful legal services offered by the Eastside Legal Assistance Program (ELAP). The story of retired Judge Catherine Shaffer, who now volunteers with ELAP, underscores the importance of legal aid for domestic violence survivors, demonstrating how community members can make a difference through volunteerism.
