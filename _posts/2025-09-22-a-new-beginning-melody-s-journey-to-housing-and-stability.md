Melody returned to Seattle during her pregnancy, seeking a fresh start near family. However, the lack of affordable housing made stability elusive. King County requires 44,000 affordable homes for low-income families, yet only 1,595 units had been created by May 2021. Melody and her baby, Jordan, faced months of uncertainty, moving between friends' couches and preparing to sleep in her car. Just as hope faded, she received a call from Mary’s Place, offering shelter. Once settled, Melody worked with a housing specialist to create a plan and find a permanent home. She was overjoyed when she received the keys to her new apartment, equipped with furniture and essentials through the Make-a-Home program. This space provided a safe environment for her and Jordan, fostering hope for their future. Now, Melody is training for a job at a local nonprofit, using her experiences to assist others transitioning from homelessness to stability. Her journey exemplifies how community support can transform lives, ensuring that families like hers have the opportunity to thrive without facing homelessness alone.
