The City of Bellevue has been awarded the 2025 Frank Chopp Public Sector Champion title by the Housing Development Consortium of Seattle-King County for its strong commitment to affordable housing. This recognition underscores Bellevue's proactive approach in addressing housing challenges, particularly through the establishment of a new Office of Housing aimed at supporting community housing needs. Director Bianca Siegl emphasized the city's focus on providing safe and affordable homes for all residents.

Bellevue's recent Comprehensive Plan update allows for the construction and preservation of up to 35,000 homes in transit-oriented areas over the next two decades, incorporating anti-displacement and reparative housing policies. The City Council is also targeting the facilitation of 5,700 new or preserved affordable homes within the next decade, representing a 128% increase over prior goals.

Additionally, Bellevue has introduced measures such as an expedited permitting process and an affordable housing fee waiver program to streamline development and reduce costs.
