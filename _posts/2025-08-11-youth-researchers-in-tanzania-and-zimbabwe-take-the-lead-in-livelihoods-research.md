title: Youth researchers in Tanzania and Zimbabwe take the lead in livelihoods research
topics:
- Employment & Job Support
- Financial Assistance
---

Six graduates from the CAMFED Association in Tanzania and Zimbabwe are spearheading research on how young women create successful businesses. They participated in the Youth Researchers Academy in Harare, which focused on enhancing their qualitative and quantitative research skills. This initiative, supported by the Mastercard Foundation and various research institutions, allows these young women to define their research questions and methods as they investigate the challenges and opportunities for young female entrepreneurs.

The research aims to evaluate the impact of CAMFED’s financial support on young women's business growth and to identify barriers to expansion. In Tanzania, the study will focus on the effects of loans and grants on businesses run by women aged 18-28. In Zimbabwe, the research will explore the influence of CAMFED’s Enterprise programs on income and well-being.

These youth researchers will also serve as mentors within the CAMFED community, enhancing the organization's research capabilities and supporting inclusive economic development. The overarching goal is to improve employment opportunities for young women across Africa, particularly in rural areas, through targeted insights and actionable data.
