The Seattle City Council has approved a 2026 budget that includes $10 million for rental assistance, aimed at supporting low-income families and individuals facing financial crises. This funding is crucial for preventing homelessness and aids affordable housing providers struggling with post-pandemic rent losses. Council President Sara Nelson spearheaded the initiative, supported by Councilmembers Bob Kettle, Rob Saka, and Mark Solomon, with $6 million of the budget designated for tenants in city-funded buildings.

Additionally, King County Councilmember De’Sean Quinn has allocated $650,000 for a new tiny house village in Tukwila, which will provide shelter for families and singles. The funds will cover operating costs for the village, currently under construction. King County Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda also secured $300,000 over two years to address operating gaps for existing tiny house villages, Riverton Park and Miracle Temple, in Tukwila. Community members are encouraged to express gratitude to the council members for their leadership in these initiatives.
