  The John Castle Corporate Partner of the Year award is given to a business in honor of Dr. John Castle, a long-time Encompass Board and emeritus board member until his passing in 2017.&nbsp; John’s passion was in helping staff develop new business initiatives, including the Encompass Pediatric Therapy clinic that has helped thousands of children with high-quality, innovative pediatric therapies. This clinic evolved into the new purpose-built Child Development Center in Snoqualmie

  **This year, the John Castle Corporate Partner of the Year Award goes to [Symetra](https://www.symetra.com/).**

  ![](https://encompassnw.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kim-Darby-award-300x200.jpg)Symetra is deeply committed to giving back to the community, and Encompass has been fortunate to benefit from that generosity.&nbsp; Through their corporate giving, matching gifts, and volunteer programs, local Symetra employees have shared their time and resources, making them a truly valued partner.

  Over the past two years, as part of their Summer of Service, Symetra employees have gone above and beyond by donating supplies and volunteering to assemble hundreds of nutritious snack packs and sparking creativity with activity packs. These thoughtful contributions make a meaningful impact, bringing joy and support to the children in our summer groups and other programs.

  Symetra is also a consistent and generous sponsor of our fundraising events, including both the Inspire Breakfast and Annual Encompass Gala over the years.

  We are especially grateful for Symetra’s commitment to empowering its employees to serve on nonprofit boards. Thanks to that support, Board Vice President Kim Darby is now serving her second term on our Board of Directors. Her personal connection to Encompass, combined with her professional expertise and commitment to her community, has made her a wonderful ambassador and an invaluable leader for our organization.

At the heart of our work is the belief that supported families strengthen communities. SVA is a true community connector, demonstrating that same belief by using their voice, their network, and their influence to bring people together.

  One example is how SVA reached out to Encompass and offered to provide a welcoming, accessible space for our therapists and families. Knowing that reducing barriers to services is a key component of the work of Encompass, SVA has generously offered the use of their beautiful new Care Cottages as a way to bring services closer to homes for many in Fall City, Carnation, and Duvall. But their support doesn’t stop there.

  Rooted in their passion for community, SVA has been instrumental in the formation of outreach opportunities, two of which are now thriving nonprofit organizations:

  [**Love Snoqualmie Valley**](https://lovesnoqualmievalley.com/) connects nonprofit organizations across the Valley to build unity and collaborate to maximize resources.

  [**CarePoint Clinic**](http://www.carepointonline.org) provides free, quality, primary healthcare to the Snoqualmie Valley and surrounding areas.

  Both organizations have become vital resources within our community.

  SVA has also offered financial contributions, helping to sustain our programs and services, ensuring children and families have the resources they need.

  Thank you, Snoqualmie Valley Alliance Church, for your compassion, your commitment, and your support in the work we do together. We admire the way you embrace our community.

  Madison found Encompass in 2021 while seeking service hours to fulfill an undergraduate requirement. She has volunteered at the last four galas and spent countless hours helping in the Child Development Center and with Early Learning programs. Madison graduated last spring, moved, got married, and started a career in the early learning sector, and still found time to dedicate to the Encompass volunteer program.

  Most recently, Madison was instrumental in providing support to the volunteer program for the Encompass annual gala. She helped weekly with volunteer recruitment and planning. The night of the gala, she was the first volunteer to arrive and the last to leave, helping to manage the 50+ gala volunteers. Madison kept things running smoothly with relentless enthusiasm.

  What began as a graduation requirement became a strong connection and devotion toward our mission. Madison gives more than her time, she shares her passion and unwavering commitment to children, families, and community.

  **Congratulations to our partners of the year, and thank you for your generosity in our shared vision of a community where ALL children thrive!**
