Every other Thursday, Sarada eagerly awaits the delivery of meals from Eileen, her driver from Catholic Community Services (CCS). This service, known as Home Delivered Meals, has been crucial for Sarada and many seniors, providing not just food but also companionship and dignity. Following a serious heart condition that forced her into early retirement, Sarada struggled with daily tasks and nutrition. After surgery, she reached out to her insurance caseworker, who connected her to CCS for meal assistance. 

The Home Delivered Meals program, operational for over 40 years, offers biweekly deliveries of frozen meals tailored to meet various health needs. This year, the program served 595 seniors, totaling over 57,000 meals. With nearly seven million seniors in the U.S. facing food insecurity, CCS addresses this issue through targeted meal programs. For Sarada, the meals have allowed her to maintain her independence despite her health challenges. Now approaching her 84th birthday, she continues to live on her own, crediting her well-being to the support from CCS. Despite her success, many others still struggle with food access, prompting CCS to urge community support for their nutrition programs.
