  <p>Every other Thursday, Sarada looks forward to hearing a familiar knock at her door. It’s Eileen, her Home Delivered Meals diver from Catholic Community Services (CCS), bringing not only a two-week supply of meals, but also a moment of connection and care.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



  <p>“Catholic Community Services was a godsend,” Sarada says.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>For Sarada and hundreds of other seniors, Home Delivered Meals provide much more than food; they offer connection, dignity, and the support needed to live independently.&nbsp;</p>

  <h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A Life-Changing Diagnosis </strong>&nbsp;</h4>



  <p>When Sarada was diagnosed with a serious heart condition, she was suddenly forced into an early retirement. She focused on maintaining her health and independence, but after undergoing an intense surgery, she found she lacked the physical capacity to perform everyday tasks.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>“My meals seemed to be my biggest obstacle to overcome as far as my rehabbing,” Sarada says. “I didn’t quite have enough energy to complete a meal or to really fully take care of myself.”&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Determined to find a solution, Sarada reached out to her insurance caseworker, who connected her with CCS. Our Home Delivered Meals program stepped up to provide Sarada with the meals she needed to recover healthily.&nbsp;</p>



  <p>Together, Sarada and the Home Delivered Meals team worked to create a meal plan that would meet all her nutritional needs. The program started delivering 14 meals every other week, providing Sarada with reliable nutrition while she recovered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Every other Thursday, Sarada eagerly awaits the delivery of meals from Eileen, her driver from Catholic Community Services (CCS). This service, known as Home Delivered Meals, has been crucial for Sarada and many seniors, providing not just food but also companionship and dignity. Following a serious heart condition that forced her into early retirement, Sarada struggled with daily tasks and nutrition. After surgery, she reached out to her insurance caseworker, who connected her to CCS for meal assistance.

The Home Delivered Meals program, operational for more than 40 years, offers biweekly deliveries of frozen meals tailored to meet various health needs. This year, the program served 595 seniors, totaling more than 57,000 meals. With nearly 7 million seniors in the U.S. facing food insecurity, CCS addresses this issue through targeted meal programs. For Sarada, the meals have allowed her to maintain her independence despite her health challenges. Now approaching her 84th birthday, she continues to live on her own, crediting her well-being to the support from CCS. Despite her success, many others still struggle with food access, prompting CCS to urge community support for its nutrition programs.
