  <p>As we kick off <strong>Gratitude Week</strong>, a time when BrightSpark reflects on the moments, people, and partnerships we’re most thankful for, one story stands out. A story that reminds us why this work matters and why your support is such a gift to our communities.</p>

  <p><strong>We Are Grateful for Alexis Cortes!</strong></p>



  <p>Alexis is a loving mother of four (soon to be five), a devoted student, and a courageous advocate. Her journey with BrightSpark began at a simple community event at her oldest child’s school, where she connected with our Early Head Start team. <strong>From that first interaction, she felt something rare: patience, encouragement, and a team committed to helping her family succeed.</strong></p>



  <p>As she enrolled two of her children in Early Head Start, while preparing for a new baby and returning to school, BrightSpark was there to walk alongside her. “They showed a lot of patience, which you don’t always see nowadays,” she said.</p>
  </div>
  </div></div>



  <p>When her daughter was later diagnosed with autism, Alexis became a tireless champion for her needs. That advocacy spirit led her to join our Early Head Start Policy Council in 2023; and then to be elected Chair just a year later! Today, she is a respected leader who helps review program finances, strengthen outreach, and build community among families.</p>

As Gratitude Week begins, BrightSpark celebrates leaders like Alexis Cortes, a dedicated mother and advocate. Her journey with BrightSpark began at a community event, where she found support from the Early Head Start team. Enrolling two children in the program while preparing for a new baby and returning to school, Alexis experienced the team's patience and encouragement. After her daughter was diagnosed with autism, she became an advocate for her child's needs, eventually joining the Early Head Start Policy Council and being elected Chair within a year. Today, Alexis plays a crucial role in reviewing program finances, enhancing outreach, and fostering community among families. BrightSpark emphasizes the importance of stories like Alexis's, showcasing how community support can drive real change in early learning. Through their programs, families gain access to quality care, parents become advocates, children receive equitable starts, and community voices are amplified. This week, BrightSpark expresses gratitude for its supporters, highlighting their collective impact on creating accessible and affordable early learning opportunities across King and Pierce Counties.
