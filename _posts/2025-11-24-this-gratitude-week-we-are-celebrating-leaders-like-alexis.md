As Gratitude Week begins, BrightSpark celebrates leaders like Alexis Cortes, a dedicated mother and advocate. Her journey with BrightSpark began at a community event, where she found support from the Early Head Start team. Enrolling two children in the program while preparing for a new baby and returning to school, Alexis experienced the team's patience and encouragement. After her daughter was diagnosed with autism, she became an advocate for her child's needs, eventually joining the Early Head Start Policy Council and being elected Chair within a year. Today, Alexis plays a crucial role in reviewing program finances, enhancing outreach, and fostering community among families. BrightSpark emphasizes the importance of stories like Alexis's, showcasing how community support can drive real change in early learning. Through their programs, families gain access to quality care, parents become advocates, children receive equitable starts, and community voices are amplified. This week, BrightSpark expresses gratitude for its supporters, highlighting their collective impact on creating accessible and affordable early learning opportunities across King and Pierce Counties.
