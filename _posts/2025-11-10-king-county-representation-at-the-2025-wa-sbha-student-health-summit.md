A significant representation from King County's school-based health organizations participated, presenting on various initiatives. Public Health–Seattle and King County (PHSKC) discussed support for Clinic Coordinators, while HealthPoint shared its successful integration of a student health council at Thomas Jefferson High School. Kaiser Permanente and PHSKC highlighted projects from their student health leadership group at Cleveland High School. Additionally, PHSKC contributed to a panel addressing the role of Local Health Jurisdictions in supporting school-based health centers. Attendees included partners such as Kaiser Permanente, HealthPoint, Neighborcare, ICHS, PHSKC, Seattle Roots, Federal Way Public Schools, and Seattle Public Schools. The summit attracted nearly 100 participants, providing valuable networking and learning opportunities among peers from across the state.
