The City of Bellevue is enhancing its efforts to combat hate crimes and bias incidents by forging partnerships with community organizations and increasing public awareness. A recent panel discussion, facilitated by Dr. Marcus Johnson from the Diversity Advantage Team, brought together city staff and over 40 local nonprofits to address community needs and strategies for prevention. Dr. Linda Whitehead, the chief diversity, equity, and inclusion officer, emphasized the city’s commitment to sharing vital information and fostering collaboration in response to rising hate crimes nationally. Police Chief Wendell Shirley acknowledged Bellevue's safety while recognizing the reality of hate crimes and bias incidents, stressing the importance of trust and accountability. The event, held at the Crossroads Community Center, featured discussions on the definitions of hate crimes—motivated by perceptions of race, religion, gender, or disability—and bias incidents, which, while not criminal, are still discriminatory. Community members were encouraged to report incidents to the police to help enhance safety and accountability. Information on reporting hate crimes and bias-related incidents is accessible through the city’s resources.
