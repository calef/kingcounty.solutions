  Even with secure housing, many residents are concerned about affording nutritious food due to the escalating cost of groceries. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, grocery prices have risen 29% since February 2020, which disproportionately impacts those on fixed or low incomes.

  Thanks to a generous grant from the Little Company of Mary Sisters, USA, Mercy Housing Lakefront is partnering with Top Box Foods and UIC Cooking Matters to address food insecurity across our permanent supportive housing communities in Chicago.

Many residents in permanent supportive housing face challenges affording nutritious food due to rising grocery prices, which have increased 29% since February 2020. Mercy Housing Lakefront, supported by a grant from the Little Company of Mary Sisters, is collaborating with Top Box Foods and UIC Cooking Matters to tackle food insecurity in Chicago. Earlier this year, Top Box Foods provided weekly meal kits to residents at various apartments for eight weeks, while UIC Cooking Matters offered nutrition and cooking classes to empower residents to prepare healthy meals. The partnership has been extended for an additional two months, supplying meal kits to 12 Mercy Housing communities and emergency food vouchers for those in need. In August alone, Top Box Foods distributed 4,014 pounds of food, benefiting 188 households. This initiative aims to enhance access to food and improve residents' cooking skills, helping them lead healthier lives.
