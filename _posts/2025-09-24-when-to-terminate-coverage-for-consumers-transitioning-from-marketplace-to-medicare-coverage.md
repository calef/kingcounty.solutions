Consumers transitioning from Marketplace coverage to Medicare coverage should terminate their Marketplace coverage when they are eligible for Medicare. This ensures that individuals do not have overlapping coverage, which can lead to confusion and potential penalties. It is important for consumers to be aware of their eligibility dates for Medicare and to coordinate their coverage transitions carefully. By terminating Marketplace coverage at the appropriate time, consumers can smoothly transition to Medicare without issues related to coverage gaps or duplicate plans. Consumers should refer to the guidelines and resources available to understand the specific timing and process for terminating their Marketplace coverage as they move to Medicare.
