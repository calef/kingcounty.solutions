Nearly 80% of adults prefer to remain in their own homes as they age, as aging in place promotes better health by keeping older adults active, reducing stress, and strengthening emotional well-being through connections with friends and neighbors. Research indicates that strong social ties can significantly extend life expectancy, comparable to the effects of quitting smoking. Financially, aging in place is often more affordable than assisted living or nursing facilities, which can cost between $48,000 and $100,000 annually.

However, challenges arise as health needs change, making everyday tasks more difficult. Eastside Friends of Seniors (EFS) addresses these challenges by providing essential support that allows older adults to live safely and comfortably at home. EFS relies on community volunteers who offer practical assistance and companionship, creating a mutually enriching experience. This exchange fosters deep connections and perspectives, enhancing the quality of life for both seniors and volunteers. EFS aims to weave compassion and support into the community, emphasizing that aging in place is a commitment to honoring lives and fostering resilience, joy, and belonging for everyone involved.
