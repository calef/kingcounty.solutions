LifeWire, a nonprofit organization in Washington State dedicated to assisting domestic violence survivors, has raised alarms over President Trump's executive order that freezes federal funding. This funding, which constitutes over two-thirds of LifeWire's budget, is critical for providing shelter, housing, and support services for survivors at risk of high-lethality situations. Janeira Bencosme-Gil, the Interim Executive Director, emphasized that this sudden halt jeopardizes essential services, placing the safety and well-being of survivors and their children at serious risk. According to the National Domestic Violence Hotline, 1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men experience physical violence from a partner during their lifetime. The executive order's scope, which aims to align federal grants with administration priorities, has caused widespread uncertainty within the nonprofit sector, with Diane Yentel, President of the National Council of Nonprofits, warning it could severely disrupt thousands of organizations. LifeWire has called for immediate reversal of the order, highlighting that the issue transcends budgetary concerns and is fundamentally about protecting vulnerable families and saving lives. LifeWire has been serving survivors since 1982, helping over 165,000 individuals through various support programs.
