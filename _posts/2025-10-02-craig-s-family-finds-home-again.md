Craig's life changed dramatically when severe water damage rendered his apartment unlivable, forcing him and his two children, Tanner and Ellie, out of their home. The family lost many cherished belongings and faced significant housing debt, leading them to a difficult period of instability. They moved between hotels, stayed with friends, and eventually slept in their car, struggling to stay warm and safe. Despite holding a full-time job, Craig’s income was too high for low-income housing assistance, yet insufficient for market-rate apartments, leaving him feeling stuck and desperate.

Reaching out to Mary’s Place proved to be a turning point. With support from the outreach team, Craig developed a housing plan. They resolved his housing debt with his former landlord and secured a new lease. Generous donations helped cover moving costs, allowing the family to settle into a new apartment. Now, Craig, Tanner, and Ellie are back in a stable home, creating new memories and looking forward to the future. They are excited about planning their Halloween festivities and hosting family gatherings, demonstrating the impact of community support in overcoming challenges.
