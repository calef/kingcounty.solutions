original_content: "<p class=\"\">For Craig, home had always been the apartment where

  was turned upside down. Severe water damage made their apartment unlivable. Overnight,

  low-income housing, but with depleted savings and debt weighing him down, market-rate
  apartments were still out of reach. It was a painful place to be: working hard,
  but still unable to provide his kids with the stability they deserved.</p><p class=\"\">Feeling

  could work for his family long-term. Together, we worked with his former landlord
  to resolve housing debt and clear the way for a new lease. With the help of generous

  his kids could quickly move into their new apartment.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

  For Craig, home had always been the apartment where he was raising his two kids, Tanner and Ellie. It was where the kids’ height was marked on the wall each year, where birthday candles were blown out, and where the small joys of everyday life unfolded.

  Then, one day, their world was turned upside down. Severe water damage made their apartment unlivable. Overnight, they lost not only their home, but many of the belongings that carried their memories. The sudden move left Craig with significant housing debt, and nowhere else to go, Craig and the kids began an exhausting cycle — moving between hotels, crashing on friends’ couches, and eventually, sleeping in their car.

  Those nights were the hardest. Craig did his best to keep Tanner and Ellie warm, but the car grew bitterly cold at night. He worried constantly about their safety and what the future might hold, all while trying to reassure his children that things would be okay.

  Through it all, Craig never stopped working. He held a full-time job, but still, the dream of finding a safe place to live felt further away with each passing week. His income was just high enough to disqualify him from low-income housing, but with depleted savings and debt weighing him down, market-rate apartments were still out of reach. It was a painful place to be: working hard, but still unable to provide his kids with the stability they deserved.

  Feeling stuck and out of options, Craig reached out to Mary’s Place. _That’s when hope returned._ Our outreach team walked beside him, building a housing plan that could work for his family long-term. Together, we worked with his former landlord to resolve housing debt and clear the way for a new lease. With the help of generous donors, we also provided move-in support to cover the deposit, ensuring Craig and his kids could quickly move into their new apartment.

Craig's life changed dramatically when severe water damage rendered his apartment unlivable, forcing him and his two children, Tanner and Ellie, out of their home. The family lost many cherished belongings and faced significant housing debt, leading them to a difficult period of instability. They moved between hotels, stayed with friends, and eventually slept in their car, struggling to stay warm and safe. Despite holding a full-time job, Craig’s income was too high for low-income housing assistance, yet insufficient for market-rate apartments, leaving him feeling stuck and desperate.

Reaching out to Mary’s Place proved to be a turning point. With support from the outreach team, Craig developed a housing plan. They resolved his housing debt with his former landlord and secured a new lease. Generous donations helped cover moving costs, allowing the family to settle into a new apartment. Now, Craig, Tanner, and Ellie are back in a stable home, creating new memories and looking forward to the future. They are excited about planning their Halloween festivities and hosting family gatherings, demonstrating the impact of community support in overcoming challenges.
