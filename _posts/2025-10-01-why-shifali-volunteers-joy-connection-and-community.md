  and plenty of energy, she guided kids through fun HIIT-style workouts followed by

  hilariously competitive. Experiencing homelessness is hard on children, and our

  goes beyond activities and games. It’s about encouraging kids to recognize the strength,
  resilience, and potential inside themselves. One of her most memorable moments came
  from a simple conversation with an eight-year-old girl. <em>“I asked her what she
  wanted to be when she grew up, and she said, ‘I don’t know, you tell me.’ When I
  suggested maybe becoming a doctor for kids, her eyes lit up and she said, ‘That’s
  exactly what I want to be!’ For the next half hour, she asked question after question
  about what she’d need to study to make that dream come true. It was such a powerful
  reminder that sometimes all kids need is a little nudge to imagine what’s possible.”</em>&nbsp;</p><p
  class=\"\">She had a similar conversation with the girl’s brother, who loved soccer.
  <em>“When I told him I’d come watch him play if he became a professional player,
  he got so excited. These little affirmations can mean so much—they help kids start
  to see new paths for themselves.”</em>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">She’s also quick to
  point out that kids and families experiencing homelessness are no different than
  anyone else. <em>“These kids watch the same shows as my son, they love the same
  games- and their parents are working so incredibly hard to provide for their kids,
  just like every other parent I know. Homelessness doesn’t define them or their future.
  When organizations like Mary’s Place help ensure they have opportunities, these
  kids and parents can thrive.”</em>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">Reflecting on her experience,
  Shifali says it doesn’t feel like she’s “giving” so much as receiving. <em>“The
  time I spend with the kids fills me with so much joy and positivity. I think people
  sometimes assume volunteering means sacrificing, but honestly, it feels like the
  opposite—I get so much back.”</em>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">&nbsp;<em>“What I think
  is special about Mary’s Place is how community is at the heart of everything they
  do. There’s the community families build with one another in shelter, the broader
  community support that helps ensure families are safe and housed, and the reminder
  that every family is an important part of our larger King County community—they’re
  all our neighbors, and they matter. Not everyone can give financially, but when
  you step back and see that the true heart of Mary’s Place is fostering a supportive
  community where everyone has the chance to thrive, it becomes clear that each of
  us can play a part in that—whether it’s volunteering, fundraising, advocacy work,
  or just sharing a smile.”</em>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">Her advice to others considering
  getting involved as a volunteer? “Just start!” Whether you can give one hour a month
  or a few hours each week, your time and energy will bring joy, encouragement, and
  hope to families experiencing homelessness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n

Shifali, a volunteer at Mary’s Place in Seattle, sought a way to give back and connect with her community after moving to the city. Initially drawn to the organization, she quickly became involved in activities with children at the shelter, particularly during her "Friday Fitness Hour," where she led engaging HIIT-style workouts followed by meaningful discussions. Over time, her role expanded to include Sunday afternoons spent with kids of various ages, engaging in reading, math, and games that foster joy and friendship.

Shifali emphasizes the importance of encouraging children to recognize their potential and resilience. She shared memorable moments with kids, such as inspiring an eight-year-old girl to consider becoming a doctor, which lit up the child's imagination. Shifali believes that families experiencing homelessness are similar to any other, asserting that homelessness does not define their futures.

Reflecting on her experience, she feels that volunteering is mutually rewarding, bringing her joy and positivity. She appreciates the community focus of Mary’s Place and encourages others to get involved, regardless of the time they can commit, as every effort contributes to uplifting families in need.
