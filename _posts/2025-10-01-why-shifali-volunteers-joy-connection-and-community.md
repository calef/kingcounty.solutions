Shifali, a volunteer at Mary’s Place in Seattle, sought a way to give back and connect with her community after moving to the city. Initially drawn to the organization, she quickly became involved in activities with children at the shelter, particularly during her "Friday Fitness Hour," where she led engaging HIIT-style workouts followed by meaningful discussions. Over time, her role expanded to include Sunday afternoons spent with kids of various ages, engaging in reading, math, and games that foster joy and friendship.

Shifali emphasizes the importance of encouraging children to recognize their potential and resilience. She shared memorable moments with kids, such as inspiring an eight-year-old girl to consider becoming a doctor, which lit up the child's imagination. Shifali believes that families experiencing homelessness are similar to any other, asserting that homelessness does not define their futures.

Reflecting on her experience, she feels that volunteering is mutually rewarding, bringing her joy and positivity. She appreciates the community focus of Mary’s Place and encourages others to get involved, regardless of the time they can commit, as every effort contributes to uplifting families in need.
