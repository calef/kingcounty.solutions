During Domestic Violence Awareness Month, the importance of the legal system for survivors of domestic violence is highlighted. Survivors often require legal protections and resources to escape abusive relationships and rebuild their lives, with the legal system being essential for their safety, housing, and financial independence. Legal aid can help survivors secure protection orders, end leases for safer housing, and untangle debts from their abusers. Organizations such as ELAP provide free legal help, including pro bono attorneys, to help survivors navigate these legal processes, reinforcing everyone's right to safety, justice, and a violence-free future.
