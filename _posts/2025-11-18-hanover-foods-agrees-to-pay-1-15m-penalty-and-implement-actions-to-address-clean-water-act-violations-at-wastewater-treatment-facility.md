The Justice Department and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have announced a proposed consent decree with Hanover Foods Corporation, requiring the company to pay a $1.15 million civil penalty and implement measures to rectify Clean Water Act violations at its wastewater treatment facility in Hanover, Pennsylvania. Allegations indicate that Hanover Foods failed to adequately treat industrial wastes, posing risks to human health and the environment. The company has violated its National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit over 600 times since 2016, exceeding limits for pollutants such as suspended solids and ammonia nitrogen.

Under the consent decree, Hanover Foods will install new equipment, enhance monitoring compliance, and report violations while addressing their causes. Upgrades will include a permanent boiler to regulate treatment temperatures and improvements to operations and maintenance processes. The consent decree aims to ensure compliance with environmental standards and protect local waterways, including the Chesapeake Bay. The settlement, subject to a 30-day public comment period and court approval, reflects the commitment of the EPA and Justice Department to safeguard the environment and public health.
