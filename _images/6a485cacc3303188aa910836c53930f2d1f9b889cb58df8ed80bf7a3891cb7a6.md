  Upcoming Professional Development Opportunities

  Building Bridges: Five-Week Receptive Skills Training with Deaf Professionals
  Presented by: Richard Jacobs and Dr. Taralynn Petrites
  Interpreters will have the opportunity to enhance both their receptive and expressive skills through interaction with two Deaf professionals over the course of five weeks. The sessions will take place via Zoom on Wednesdays from 5:30 PM to 7:00 PM. Each interpreter will schedule 4 to 6 individual 30-minute sessions with Deaf mentor(s). The mentors will address topics tailored to the interpreters' needs, including fingerspelling, ASL storytelling, Deaf culture, and much more. This is a unique opportunity to prepare for the EIPA exam.

  Open house in Federal Way! We are opening a new EIPA performance test site in Federal Way starting in April 2025! If you would like to come take a look at the testing environment and look at some practice EIPA materials, join us!
  - Tuesday, March 25th 5-7pm
  - Wednesday, March 26th 4-6pm
  Please contact the CDHY Interpreter Hub Coordinator with any questions.
