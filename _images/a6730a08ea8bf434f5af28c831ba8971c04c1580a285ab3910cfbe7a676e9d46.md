title: The image features a group of people posing in what appears to be an office setting. The group, comprising men and women of various ages, stands closely for the photo, with some smiling and others chatting. In the background, there is a map on the wall and a ceiling with recessed lighting. Overlaid on the left side of the image is a large circular graphic resembling a spinning ice cream wheel with the text, "Ice Cream Social," and an illustration of a chocolate-topped ice cream cone. To the right side, there is a large, bold text block saying "THANK YOU" in a mix of blue and pink lettering. Below this, there is a paragraph expressing gratitude for attendees of the event. At the bottom, the acronym "CDHY" is displayed along with a stylized sound wave icon.
