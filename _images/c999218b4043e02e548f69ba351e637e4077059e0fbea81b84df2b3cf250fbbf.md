title: 'The image is a promotional flyer for "Local Meet-Ups" aimed at connecting
  the local DHH and interpreting community. At the top, the text "BECOMING: CONNECTION
  IN THE COMMUNITY" is in bold, with "CONNECTION IN THE COMMUNITY" curved and in red.
  Below, the details of an event scheduled for Saturday, September 20th, from 9 to
  10:30 AM are presented. It invites people who know sign language to join. Underneath,
  a list of locations and their addresses are provided for cities such as Bellevue,
  Ellensburg, Lacey, Lake Forest Park, Spokane, Tacoma, and Vancouver. Each location
  is associated with a local coffee shop or library for the meet-ups. On the bottom
  left, an illustration features a diverse group of people gesturing, some with hands
  raised in what appears to be sign language. On the right side, a simple map of Washington
  state with green shading marks the locations of the meet-ups with blue dots. At
  the bottom, there is a QR code and a logo for the Educational Interpreter Hub. The
  flyer’s color scheme includes whites, reds, and greens with bold black text.'
