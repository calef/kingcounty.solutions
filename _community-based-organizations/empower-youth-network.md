Empower Youth Network offers mentoring, job-readiness support, and life-skills coaching for Eastside youth, connecting them to education and employment pathways. Their contribution helps reduce service gaps for younger populations, complements AEA’s goal of serving all ages, and supports the network’s capacity to respond to youth-focused human-services needs.
