**Diagnostic Testing** refers to medical and public health tests that identify or confirm the presence of diseases, infections, or other health conditions. These tests help guide treatment, track outbreaks, and support early detection. Services may include laboratory testing, imaging, screenings, and point-of-care diagnostics for both infectious and chronic conditions.
