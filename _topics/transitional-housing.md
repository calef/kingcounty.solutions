Transitional housing provides temporary accommodations for individuals and families experiencing homelessness or housing instability. It serves those in need by offering a stable environment while they work towards permanent housing solutions. Support services often accompany these programs, helping residents gain skills, access resources, and navigate the path to long-term stability.
