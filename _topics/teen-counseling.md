Teen counseling provides support for adolescents facing emotional, social, or behavioral challenges. It serves teenagers dealing with issues like anxiety, depression, and relationship problems. Through individual or group sessions, counselors help teens develop coping strategies, improve communication skills, and foster self-esteem, promoting healthier mental well-being during a critical development stage.
