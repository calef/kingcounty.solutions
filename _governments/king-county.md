King County serves residents across urban and rural communities by providing programs that promote health, safety, and well-being. Through departments like Public Health, Community and Human Services, and Metro, the county offers housing and homelessness support, food and financial assistance, childcare and senior programs, legal aid, domestic violence resources, disability services, job training, and mental health care. It also provides affordable transportation options, recreation opportunities, and volunteer programs. These services ensure that all people—especially vulnerable populations—can access essential support, achieve stability, and fully participate in community life.
