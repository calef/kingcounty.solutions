Join us on January 29, 2026, at 3:30 PM for the Distinguished Lecture Series featuring Meredith Ringel Morris from Google DeepMind, held at the Gates Center (CSE2), G20 | Amazon Auditorium. Attendees can expect an insightful discussion on the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and artificial general intelligence (AGI). Dr. Morris will explore how HCI can enhance the usability and effectiveness of AI technologies, ensuring they align with human values and societal needs. Her talk will cover various aspects of HCI research relevant to the AGI era, including interaction techniques and evaluation methods. This is a unique opportunity to engage with cutting-edge ideas in AI and HCI, contributing to a better understanding of how these fields can work together for the benefit of individuals and communities. Note that this lecture will not be streamed live.
