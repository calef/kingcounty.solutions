  Maybe it’s five people you love, maybe it’s tenpeople you hate. Your feelings for
  them will be sincerely felt when they sing this post card piece.</p> <p><strong>To
  those who stand untroubled at the doorway (2025) for solo contrabass: Eddie Mospan</strong>To
  those who shimmer,To those who find themselves translucent, To those who linger
  in the atmosphere:To those whose laughter scintillatesTo those who do not cool and
  settle, but bask in the glow of their amorphous incandescence,To those whose clicking
  eyelids capture moments and turn them into places: I recognize you, I see you, I
  know you. I hear you. I remember you.I am you. I too have lived in the interstices. I
  write to those who do not wait, but stand untroubled at the doorway.</p> <p><strong>Simple
  Pleasures for piano, windchimes, electric fan, tea kettle, fixed media and one performer</strong><strong>(2024)
  : Oliver Schoonove</strong>Simple Pleasures is dedicated to Doogan Townsend, who
  gave me hexatonic windchimesfor my 22nd birthday. The piece is a celebration of
  the beautiful ringing of the windchimes, thehexatonic collection, everyday noises
  such as water pouring and an electric fan, the drama of ateapot slowly boiling,
  and the many sounds of electronic music. The piano writing is non-virtuosic and
  invites the performer to savor every interval, immersing themselves in the hexatonic
  sound and enjoying moments it breaks from the collection. I’ve never had more fun
  while writing a piece and I hope this comes across.</p> <h2>Director Biographies</h2>
