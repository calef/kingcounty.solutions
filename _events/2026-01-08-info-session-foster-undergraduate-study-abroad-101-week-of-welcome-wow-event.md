  The rest of the IES Abroad Programs are semester-long in length and are going to
  consist of a mix of undergraduate students from across the USA. An IES Abroad Semester-long
  Program would be a good option for a student who is interested in a specific location
  that is not offered through any of the other programs, someone who wants to go abroad
  for longer than a quarter, would like to meet USA students not from UW, or someone
  who wants to have the option to add on an internship, language study, a homestay,
  or the chance to take some courses at a local university.</p> <p>The IES Abroad
  Semester-long Programs can be quite expensive for a UW in-state student. All courses
  on an IES Abroad Program will be awarded UW credit upon completion. You need to

  a semester. This unique set up allows students to move between locations during
  their study abroad program or stay in the same place the whole time. To make it
  work for the quarter, students will enroll in Fall Blocks II+III or Spring Blocks
  I+II.</p> <p>Foster undergraduate majors can earn Foster credit on CIEE in person

  on the application brochure page on the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/studyabroad/">UW
  Study Abroad Office website?</a> </h3> <ul> <li>An application is started which
  you can revisit at any time. You can save items if you want to return to work on
  things later.</li> <li>There are no application fees, except for CIEE. Start an
  application to see what is involved!</li> </ul> <h3>What are the components of an
  application?</h3> <ul> <li>Each program has a personal statement component. This
  is your essay of why you want to go on the program. We suggest touching on the personal,
  academic and/or career relevance of the program in your essay. Tell the story of
  why you think going abroad in important and what about the specific program you
  are applying for make it is a good fit.</li> <li>In addition to the personal statement,
  some programs require a transcript to be uploaded or a faculty/TA/adviser recommendation.
  The recommendation is a short online survey that takes only a few minutes to complete.</li>
  <li>Programs will also have a required in-person or Zoom interview which takes place
  after the online application deadline has passed.</li> </ul> <h3>How many programs
  can I apply to?</h3> <ul> <li>You can apply to up to 3 programs in the same time
  period/term, this is only going to be a constraint for Early Fall Start when there
  are 30+ programs happening at the same time. This means you can apply to 3 programs
  happening in Fall Quarter, and another 3 happening in Winter Quarter, etc.</li>
  <li>If you are interested in more than one program, definitely apply to multiple!
  Again, there is no application fee.</li> </ul> <h3>How does a semester match up
  with the UW quarter system on Foster Exchange &amp; Direct Enroll?</h3> <ul> <li>For
  Fall Semester, you earn 18-24 UW credits (roughly 4-6 courses), pay 1.5 your UW
  tuition rate and only miss Fall Quarter. (Paying more and earning more credit than
  if you were on campus)</li> <li>For Spring Semester, you earn 18-24 UW credits (roughly
  4-6 courses), pay 1.5 your UW tuition rate and miss Winter and Spring Quarters.
  (Paying less and earning less credit than if you were on campus)</li> <li>RSM is
  the one Foster Exchange partner on the quarter system. For RSM, students miss just
  one quarter and pay one quarter of tuition to UW to earn 12-17 UW credits.</li>
  <li>We have 2 Direct Enroll Programs (University College Dublin in Ireland and Universidad
  de San Andres in Argentina) where students pay a program fee for one semester, instead
  of their UW tuition. These two universities will be cheaper for out-of-state students
  than an Exchange. Students will still earn 18-24 UW credits for one semester.</li>
  </ul> <h3>How much does it cost to study abroad?</h3> <ul> <li>All programs, besides
  Exchanges, are based on a program fee model; so all students pay the same amount
  to participate on the program regardless of residency status. Some program fees
  include housing (Faculty-Led Programs, CIEE and IES Abroad) and some do not (ALBA
  Barcelona).</li> <li>Exchange Programs are 1.5 times a student’s quarterly tuition
  rate for one semester.</li> </ul> <h3>Can I use my financial aid?</h3> <ul> <li>Yes
  you can! A note for programs happening during Summer, summer aid is separate from
  the academic year so you have to apply specifically for summer aid in late Winter
  Quarter or early Spring Quarter.</li> <li>You must earn the minimum amount of UW
  credit required by Financial Aid for all quarters you are abroad. Meaning if you
  are missing both Winter and Spring Quarters on a Foster Exchange or Direct Enroll
  Program, you must earn at least 24 UW credits since you are enrolled abroad for
  2 UW quarters (12 credit minimum per quarter).</li> <li>To help you demystify financing

  Semester-Long Programs The rest of the IES Abroad Programs are semester-long in
  length and are going to consist of a mix of undergraduate students from across the
  USA. An IES Abroad Semester-long Program would be a good option for a student who
  is interested in a specific location that is not offered through any of the other
  programs, someone who wants to go abroad for longer than a quarter, would like to
  meet USA students not from UW, or someone who wants to have the option to add on
  an internship, language study, a homestay, or the chance to take some courses at
  a local university. The IES Abroad Semester-long Programs can be quite expensive
  for a UW in-state student. All courses on an IES Abroad Program will be awarded
  UW credit upon completion. You need to apply to IES and then to the UW Study Abroad
  Office. Below are the business-focused options.  Vienna – Business, Economics &
  International Relations Amsterdam – Business & Economics Nice – Business, Sustainability
  & Immigration Paris – Business & International Affairs Siena – Business & Economics
  of Italian Food & Wine London – Business Milan – Business Studies  IES Abroad offers
  scholarships, apply for their scholarships when applying to a program. These are
  not all need-based, so apply even if you do not have any FAFSA need.   CIEE UW Partner
  Program: This is not a Foster affiliated program but some of the CIEE programs do
  offer business courses.  CIEE is a study abroad company partnered with UW which
  offers quarter, semester, and summer study abroad programs focused on a variety
  of subject areas. Their programs sometimes do not align with the UW quarter system
  so please check with a UW Study Abroad Office adviser to make sure the term(s) work
  for UW. Like IES Abroad, CIEE also offers internships part-time alongside other
  classes or full-time during the summer. Quarter-long Programs:  CIEE Open Campus
  Block Programs On CIEE’s Open Campus Block Programs, students can complete 2 blocks
  to count for a UW quarter, or 3 blocks to count for a semester. This unique set
  up allows students to move between locations during their study abroad program or
  stay in the same place the whole time. To make it work for the quarter, students
  will enroll in Fall Blocks II+III or Spring Blocks I+II. Foster undergraduate majors
  can earn Foster credit on CIEE in person courses. Check out the Foster Study Abroad
  Course Equivalency List to see the Foster equivalents for CIEE courses. You can
  find CIEE under the “Other UW Approved Programs” tab since this is not a Foster
  study abroad program. The Foster School will not approve ASU online classes (through
  CIEE programs) as Foster major requirements. CIEE in person courses can fulfill
  major requirements if approved as an equivalent. Foster minors cannot meet minor
  requirements through CIEE. Business minor credit is only available on Foster Exploration
  Seminars. Semester-long Programs: CIEE has many semester-long programs offering
  business, language and non-business credit. They also offer stand-alone internships.    Questions?

  Abroad    The GBC’s goal is to help UW Foster School of Business students meet the
  world! Study abroad is a tremendous learning opportunity for Foster students to
  enhance their business education and gain the international perspective required
  to do business in today’s global economy. This page presents study abroad programs
  offering business credit for UW undergraduates. Some of these programs, or some
  of the courses on the programs, will only be open to current Foster undergraduate
  major students but many are open to all UW undergrad students. Be in touch with
  a GBC Study Abroad Adviser if you want to chat one-on-one about anything related
  to business-focused study abroad programs. You can check out the handout version
  of this page here: Foster Undergraduate Study Abroad Options.      Program Types    To
  help you understand how one experience is different from another   Foster Faculty-Led
  Programs: Go abroad with Foster Faculty and Staff on a highly supportive study abroad
  experience with a cohort of your UW peers. These programs either focus on earning
  upper division business core credit abroad or elective credit through company visits.  Partner
  Programs: These are third party companies that organize study abroad programs for
  USA students where all the courses count as UW credit.  Foster Exchange & Direct
  Enroll Programs: Enroll in a business school abroad and earn UW credit at one of
  Foster’s 23 university partners. This is a highly independent and immersive experience
  where you join students from around the world to become a visiting student at another
  university.       Next Steps    Research your study abroad options by:   Reviewing
  the Foster Undergraduate Study Abroad Options  Attending a Foster Study Abroad info
  session  Talking with a Global Business Center Foster Study Abroad Adviser   Talk
  with your Academic Adviser to understand how study abroad fits into your UW degree
  plan.  Explore how you will fund study abroad. Start with the UW Financial Aid Office
  to get an idea of how your financial aid applies to studying abroad. Additionally,
  the UW Study Abroad Office has both Financial Aid and Scholarship resources. If
  you are a Foster major, make sure to apply for a Global Business Center Study Abroad
  Scholarship.  Apply by the application deadline!       Foster Study Abroad Fee    Each
  Foster Study Abroad Program will include the following fees in the program price
  which students are responsible for once they sign the payment contract: Foster Study
  Abroad Fee and UW Study Abroad Fee The Foster Study Abroad Fee is an Administrative
  Fee that funds all Foster Study Abroad activities, including the organization and
  operations of the programs; the recruitment, selection, and support of program participants;
  and the offering of study abroad advising. This fee is charged to all students participating
  on a Foster Study Abroad Program regardless of major. This is a non-refundable fee
  charged to students even if they withdraw from their study abroad program. The Foster
  Study Abroad Fee is $375 through Spring Quarter 2026 and the fee will increase starting
  with programs happening in Summer 2026 to $390. If you cannot participate in a Foster
  study abroad program for which you have submitted a contract, you may submit a Foster
  Emergency Withdrawal Petition. If granted, the Emergency Withdrawal may allow for
  partial relief from your Foster Study Abroad Fee (separate from program fee and
  UW Study Abroad Fee). Please note that you will also need to submit an emergency
  withdrawal petition to UW Study Abroad to be considered for partial relief from
  the other financial obligations for the program (i.e. program fee and UW Study Abroad
  fee). The committee reviews Foster emergency withdrawal petitions on the first Thursday
  of every month.      Other Study Abroad Options    Check out the UW Study Abroad
  Office website to learn about all the other study abroad programs at UW. These are
  programs offering non-business credit that can help you fulfill General Education
  Requirements like A&H and SSc credit or CISB language or areas studies credit. There
  are more than 45 UW-wide student exchanges with universities around the world in
  addition to the Foster Exchange & Direct Enroll Programs found above. Some of these
  UW-wide exchange programs offer business courses, such as, Keio University in Japan
  and the National Taiwan University in Taiwan. There are also many UW departments
  running their own Faculty-led Programs like the iSchool, Public Health, CHID, Spanish,
  French & Italian, Art History, and Honors.      Video Recordings    Study Abroad  Business

  earn at least 24 UW credits since you are enrolled abroad for 2 UW quarters (12
  credit minimum per quarter). To help you demystify financing your study abroad experience,
  check out the UW Study Abroad Office resources.  Are there scholarships specifically
  for study abroad?  Yes! If you are a Foster School student or you are applying to
  Foster, apply for the Global Business Center Study Abroad Scholarships. Also check
  the scholarship box when you apply to a program via the UW Study Abroad Office program
  application. That considers you for the UW Study Abroad Office Scholarships. Beyond
  that, there are many more scholarships out there. Learn more on the UW Study Abroad
  Office resources webpage.  How competitive are the Foster Study Abroad Programs?  This
  is very hard to say, it really depends on the year. Just apply!  Can I have someone
  look over my personal statement?  The Global Business Center cannot review any personal
  statements. Go to the Odegaard Writing and Research Center (OWRC) or the CLUE Writing
  Center.  I am not in the Foster School yet, what can I apply to? I do not plan to
  be a Foster student, can I apply?  Most programs are open to all UW undergrads,
