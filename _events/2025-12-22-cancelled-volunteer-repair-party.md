The Volunteer Repair Party scheduled for December 22, 2025, from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM at the Bike Works Warehouse in Seattle has been cancelled. These events typically offer adults aged 18 and up the opportunity to engage in bike repair, regardless of their mechanical skills. Participants can learn essential bike maintenance techniques while contributing to the community. However, please note that this event will not take place as planned. For future opportunities, interested individuals are encouraged to check for updates on upcoming Volunteer Repair Parties, which are held on Mondays and Thursdays.
