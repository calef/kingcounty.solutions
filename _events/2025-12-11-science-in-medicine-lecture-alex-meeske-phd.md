  <h3>Phage transcription factors that silence CRISPR-Cas immunity</h3> <p><strong>Biography</strong></p>
  <p>Dr. Meeske earned his Bachelor of Science from the University of Connecticut.
  He then conducted his PhD studies with Dr. David Rudner at Harvard Medical School,
  where he studied the processes by which bacteria construct their protective envelope
  (the cell wall). He went on to do postdoctoral work with Dr. Luciano Marraffini
  at The Rockefeller University, where he investigated the complex immune systems
  used by bacteria to protect themselves from viruses. One of these immune systems,
  called CRISPR, has been exploited for precise and programmable DNA editing in a
  wide range of organisms – an approach with curative potential for many genetic diseases.
  At UW, Dr. Meeske’s group has continued to explore the functions of bacterial immune
  systems, how viruses have evolved to overcome them, and how we can leverage these
  processes to develop new biotechnology tools. His Science in Medicine Lecture will
  cover the diverse molecular mechanisms by which Listeria phages inhibit CRISPR immunity.</p>

Join us for the Science in Medicine Lecture featuring Alex Meeske, PhD, on Dec. 11, 2025, from 11 a.m. to noon at the William H. Foege Genome Sciences building. Dr. Meeske will discuss his research on phage transcription factors that silence CRISPR-Cas immunity, exploring how bacteria protect themselves from viruses and the potential applications for biotechnology. This event is an excellent opportunity for faculty, graduate students, and staff to engage with cutting-edge science and learn about the innovative work being done in the field. Don't miss this chance to gain insights into the intersection of microbiology and genetic engineering.
