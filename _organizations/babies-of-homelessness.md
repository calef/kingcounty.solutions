Babies of Homelessness is a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing essential baby supplies—diapers, wipes, and formula—to families facing homelessness in Western Washington. With a focus on eliminating barriers, we deliver these essentials directly to families in need, helping them achieve stability and improve their circumstances.
