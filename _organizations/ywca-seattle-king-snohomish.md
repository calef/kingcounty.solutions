YWCA Seattle | King | Snohomish (YWCA SKS) is a regional branch of the YWCA movement focused on eliminating racism, empowering women, and advancing justice for communities across Seattle, King County, and Snohomish County. From its downtown Seattle headquarters, the organization partners with public agencies, philanthropy, and resident leaders to deliver culturally rooted services that reflect the needs of women, gender-diverse people, and families of color.

Its program finder highlights an integrated menu of housing, health and safety, and economic advancement supports: emergency shelters, supportive and permanent housing, and rental and utility assistance to prevent homelessness; legal services, counseling, health access, and DV advocacy that keep survivors safe; and career centers, financial education, youth development, and job training that build lasting economic mobility. YWCA SKS also connects parents, youth, and returning community members to basic needs resources, childcare, and peer navigation so participants can stabilize, heal, and thrive close to home.
