The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulates interstate communications across radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable to keep people connected and safe. It issues licenses, enforces consumer protections, expands broadband access, and maintains reliable emergency communications. Consumers can file complaints, get guidance on robocalls and billing disputes, and learn about affordability programs through the agency’s help center.
