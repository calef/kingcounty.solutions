The YMCA of Greater Seattle (YGS) is the region's founding nonprofit and operates 14 membership branches, two overnight camps, early learning centers, and dozens of before- and after-school enrichment sites throughout King County. Through membership programs, child care, camps, and culturally responsive equity initiatives, the Y provides spaces for youth, families, and older adults to build health, leadership skills, and community support.

Its Social Impact Center coordinates behavioral health counseling, crisis response, street outreach, drop-in navigation, and a continuum of shelter, transitional, and permanent supportive housing for youth and young adults experiencing homelessness or system involvement. Those services are paired with education, employment, and life-skills coaching so participants can stabilize housing, access income, and stay connected to caring adults while they work toward long-term wellbeing.
