El Centro de la Raza (ECDLR) is a civil-rights-rooted community anchor that now combines **43 programs** into nine service areas—Food & Health, Benefits & Resource Navigation, Workforce Development, Advocacy & Culture, Youth Services, Housing, Small Business Services, Child & Family Services, and Financial Empowerment—so multilingual families can find culturally specific support in one place.

Programs operate from the historic Beacon Hill schoolhouse at 2524 16th Avenue S, the neighboring Plaza Roberto Maestas & Centilia Cultural Center complex, a South King County campus in Federal Way, and multiple José Martí Child Development Center sites throughout Seattle. Those hubs connect households to bilingual early learning, youth leadership, rent and utility assistance, asset-building and small business coaching, food distribution with health navigation, and frequent community clinics and cultural events, ensuring residents can stabilize housing, grow incomes, and stay engaged in civic life across King County.
