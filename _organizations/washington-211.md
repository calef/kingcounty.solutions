Washington 211 (WA211) runs the statewide 2-1-1 information and referral network, connecting residents to more than 27,000 verified resources for food, housing, health care, financial help, transportation, and other wraparound services. People can dial 2-1-1, call the toll-free 1-877-211-9274 line, text "211WAOD" to 898211, or search the online directory to reach trained specialists who offer multilingual support, warm handoffs, and follow-up tailored to each situation.

The organization also powers the 211 Counts data hub, tracks unmet-needs trends for local partners, and supports Washington's disaster response plans by relieving 9-1-1 of non-emergency calls, pushing evacuation and shelter updates, and coordinating volunteers and donations. Providers can email resources@wa211.org to update listings so the directory stays current for Washingtonians and for King County's Crisis Connections 211 operations.
