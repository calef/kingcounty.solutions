The Sophia Way offers housing and critical services to women experiencing homelessness. They provide case management, outreach, and support to help women re-establish stability. Their preventive and supportive role addresses a significant service gap in homelessness on the Eastside, aligning directly with AEA’s mission of building healthy communities through a strong human-services network.
