The **Office of the Insurance Commissioner (OIC)** regulates Washington’s insurance industry and delivers direct consumer support through its Tumwater headquarters and statewide helplines. The agency’s consumer advocacy teams investigate complaints, run disaster-response outreach, and coordinate translators so every resident can access insurance protections. OIC’s social-service reach includes:

- **Financial Assistance:** market conduct exams and enforcement actions recover refunds, stop unlawful premium practices, and keep insurers solvent so families are not left with unpaid claims.
- **Health Care:** SHIBA volunteers and agency analysts guide residents through Medicare, individual market transitions, and network adequacy issues to keep coverage stable.
- **Education & Learning:** multilingual publications, webinars, and speaker requests equip community partners with up-to-date guidance on insurance rights and preparedness.

By combining regulation with high-touch counseling, OIC keeps insurance markets transparent and responsive for Washington households, small businesses, and tribal partners.
