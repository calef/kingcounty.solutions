Imagine Housing develops permanently affordable apartment communities across the Eastside so that people with low incomes, seniors, veterans, and families can live near jobs, schools, and transit. The organization pairs housing development with on-site resident services teams that support financial stability, youth enrichment, crisis intervention, and behavioral health referrals.

From Bellevue to Kirkland, Issaquah, and Sammamish, Imagine Housing coordinates with local governments, philanthropy, and service providers to keep residents stably housed and connected to health, education, and employment resources. Wraparound case management, peer programming, and eviction prevention assistance help households navigate medical expenses or income disruption so they can remain part of thriving Eastside neighborhoods.
