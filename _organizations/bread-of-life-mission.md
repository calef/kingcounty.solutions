Bread of Life Mission is a faith-based nonprofit in Pioneer Square serving men experiencing homelessness, addiction, and deep poverty. Since 1939 the mission has offered low-barrier outreach, emergency meals, showers, and winter-weather mats alongside a 24/7 enhanced shelter and LifePath recovery program that pairs case management with counseling and discipleship.

Teams activate cold-weather space when severe storms hit, operate year-round hot meals and clothing distribution, and walk residents through sobriety, housing navigation, and employment preparation. By combining Gospel-centered care with practical services and community partnerships, Bread of Life Mission helps Seattle neighbors stabilize, reconnect with family and church communities, and transition into permanent housing.
