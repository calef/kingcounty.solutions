Upward Bound is a college-readiness program for first-generation college students at Garfield and Rainier Beach High Schools. It offers tutoring, mentoring, academic guidance, and college preparation support, including a free summer college class at Seattle University. The program aims to help students from lower-income families earn a college degree.
