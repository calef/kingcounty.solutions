Catholic Community Services of Western Washington (CCSWW) is the official human-services outreach of the Catholic Church in western Washington, headquartered in Seattle and operating 12 family centers plus Catholic Housing Services sites across more than a dozen counties. Grounded in Catholic social teaching, CCSWW staff and volunteers provide culturally responsive support regardless of faith background and keep a special focus on neighbors impacted by poverty, racism, or social isolation.

The network coordinates shelters, permanent housing, and Housing and Essential Needs (HEN) aid; delivers family behavioral health care, substance use treatment, and intensive case management; prepares hundreds of thousands of meals; and supplies in-home personal care for seniors and people with disabilities. By pairing large-scale basic-needs relief with advocacy and parish partnerships, CCSWW ensures residents can tap into housing stability, mental-health services, and other safety-net resources close to home throughout western Washington.
