St. James Cathedral’s Social Outreach and Advocacy ministry mobilizes parish volunteers to serve neighbors across Seattle’s First Hill and downtown core. Through the Cathedral Kitchen and garden, teams prepare weeknight dinners sourced with fresh produce; the Sunday Breakfast program offers one of the few hot morning meals for people experiencing homelessness; and the Sandwich Making Ministry keeps St. Martin de Porres Shelter stocked with ready-to-eat food.

Outreach staff also coordinate volunteer placements at Catholic Community Services, host diaper and baby supply drives for PrePS, collect toiletries for St. Vincent de Paul deliveries, and operate the Solanus Casey Center—a walk-in referral and emergency assistance site that helps residents secure IDs, complete paperwork, or access modest financial support. Twice-monthly newsletters and year-round advocacy invite parishioners to combine hospitality, case management partnerships, and faith-based accompaniment so that Seattle neighbors receive meals, supportive services, and compassionate community.
