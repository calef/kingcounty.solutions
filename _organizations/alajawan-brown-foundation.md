The Alajawan Brown Foundation, also known as Alajawan’s Hands, carries on 12-year-old Alajawan Brown’s legacy of “making a difference in our community.” The family-led nonprofit convenes the annual Community Family Reunion, distributes thousands of free backpacks and school supplies, and collaborates with schools, King County agencies, and local businesses to meet urgent needs for children and families across Skyway and neighboring South King County neighborhoods.

Volunteers and partners prepare Thanksgiving meals, coordinate goods drives, and raise funds for scholarships that allow youth to participate in sports, camps, and other enrichment experiences they could not otherwise afford. By keeping community members connected to supplies, celebratory gatherings, and financial support, the foundation strengthens neighborhood bonds and ensures Alajawan’s spirit of generosity continues to lift up local kids and families.
