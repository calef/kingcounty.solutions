JFS Food Access combines the Polack Food Bank and home-delivered groceries so community members can choose healthy food that fits their needs. The Polack Food Bank on Capitol Hill (1601 16th Ave.) offers consumer-choice shopping on Wednesdays 10:00 a.m.–noon, Thursdays 2:00–4:00 p.m., and Fridays 10:00 a.m.–noon, while home delivery extends support to households unable to shop in person. The program is operated by Jewish Family Service Seattle and can be reached at 206-461-3240 for assistance.
