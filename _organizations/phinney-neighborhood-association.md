The Phinney Neighborhood Association (PNA) is a community anchor for the Phinney Ridge, Greenwood, and broader northwest Seattle neighborhoods. From its historic campus and Greenwood Senior Center, the PNA runs senior services, PNA Village aging-in-place supports, memory loss programming, kids co-ops, and Whittier Kids before-and-after school care so that families at every stage can tap into trusted neighborhood resources.

PNA’s social services include weekly hot meals, case management, and mutual-aid style support groups, while the DIY Hub (Tool Library, Woodshop, and Fixers Collective) helps neighbors meet household needs affordably. The organization also convenes cultural festivals, small-business events, and 800+ annual classes to build belonging, coordinate volunteers, and keep local residents connected to food, wellness, and learning opportunities throughout North Seattle.
