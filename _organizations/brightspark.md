BrightSpark builds kid-centric, antiracist early learning communities for families and caregivers throughout King and Pierce counties. From its Renton administrative office and satellite sites in Tacoma, Lake City, and the Kent Business Campus, the nonprofit staffs a Family Call Center (206-329-5544 / 1-800-446-1114 plus a dedicated Spanish line) alongside provider hotlines (206-329-5333 for King County and 253-272-8000 for Pierce County) that connect residents to preschool enrollment, subsidy navigation, and culturally responsive supports.

Programs span Kaleidoscope Play and Learn® groups, the Brothers & Sisters Program for youth caregivers, and the Early Head Start Family Child Care Partnership that serves providers and families in South Pierce and King counties. BrightSpark’s coaches help child care businesses meet quality standards, secure professional development, and tap Seattle Preschool Program and FEPP levy resources, while its advocacy team keeps community voices in policy conversations so the region’s early learning ecosystem remains equitable, affordable, and well coordinated.
