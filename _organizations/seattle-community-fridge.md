Seattle Community Fridge is a volunteer-run mutual aid network that keeps community fridges and pantries stocked with free food across Seattle (including sites in Phinney Ridge, Rainier Beach/Dunlap, Beacon Hill, Capitol Hill, Capitol Hill LGBTQ+ Center, Burien, and the Central District). Founded in 2020, the 501(c)(3) group operates without staff or offices, focusing donations directly on fresh, accessible food so neighbors can take what they need and give what they can. Contact the collective via email for volunteering or stocking details.
