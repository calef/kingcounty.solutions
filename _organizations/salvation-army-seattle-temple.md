Part of The Salvation Army’s Western Territory, Seattle Temple Corps anchors ministry and social services for North King County from its Greenwood Avenue campus. Officers and volunteers provide Sunday worship, pastoral care, and small groups, while weekday outreach includes food support, financial assistance, elderly visitation, youth enrichment, and partnerships with the Adult Rehabilitation Program and nearby shelters.

The corps serves as a neighborhood hub where residents can find prayer, community, and practical aid—whether through youth mentorship, supportive casework, or referrals that help families stabilize housing and employment. By combining faith programming with tangible help, Seattle Temple Corps keeps neighbors connected to compassionate relationships and the wider Salvation Army network of rehabilitation, emergency response, and mutual-aid services.
