The **Federal Executive Branch** enforces and administers U.S. laws through the leadership of the **president**, **vice president**, and **executive agencies**. It includes the **Cabinet departments**, **independent agencies**, and **regulatory commissions** that carry out federal policies and programs. The president serves as **head of state, chief executive, and commander in chief**, overseeing national defense, foreign affairs, and government operations. Supported by millions of federal employees, the executive branch ensures laws passed by Congress are implemented effectively, manages the nation’s day-to-day governance, and upholds the Constitution.
