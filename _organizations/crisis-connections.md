Crisis Connections operates the region’s major 24/7 crisis and information lines, including the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline, King County 2‑1‑1, WA Recovery Help Line, and Teen Link. Staff and trained volunteers provide immediate emotional support, safety planning, and referrals for mental health, substance use, housing, healthcare, and other basic needs across King County and Washington State. The organization partners with local providers to coordinate warm handoffs, follow-up contacts, and community education that strengthen crisis response and keep residents connected to ongoing care.***
