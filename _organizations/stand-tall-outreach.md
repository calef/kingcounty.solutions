Stand Tall Outreach is a grassroots mutual-aid nonprofit that brings food, street outreach, and trauma-informed peer support directly to neighbors experiencing homelessness in Seattle. Volunteers distribute hot meals, hygiene kits, warm clothing, and emergency items, while the We Hear You support line offers confidential text or phone check-ins for people facing emotional crises, domestic violence, or isolation.

The organization also hosts seasonal drives such as Thanksgiving dinners and back-to-school giveaways, runs youth mentorship clubs, recognizes local educators and small businesses, and connects families to housing referrals, job training, and mental health resources through its partnership network. By pairing immediate relief with community-building events and case navigation, Stand Tall Outreach empowers individuals and families to rebuild stability and “stand tall” together.
