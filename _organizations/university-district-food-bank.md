University District Food Bank provides choice-based groceries from its University District market and two satellite pantries (Mercy Magnuson Place and North Seattle College). Households can shop once per week for fresh groceries; home-delivery and no-cook options are available. The food bank also connects neighbors to resources like mail service and other basic-needs supports to build a hunger-free Northeast Seattle.
