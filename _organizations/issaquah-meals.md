Issaquah Meals offers free dinners Monday through Friday at 5:00 p.m. at the Community Hall next to the Issaquah fire station (180 E. Sunset Way). Started in 1989 by Catholic Community Services, the program welcomes guests nightly, provides a site leader to share resources, and relies on volunteer groups from local congregations and community organizations to prepare and serve meals. Volunteer groups are invited to cover an evening each month; reach the team at ccskingcountyinfo@ccsww.org or 425-679-0342 to help.
