St. Peter's United Methodist Church is a neighborhood congregation in Bellevue’s Crossroads area that blends worship, small groups, and community outreach. The church hosts in-person and online Sunday services, a mix of multilingual and intergenerational gatherings, and weekly opportunities for newcomers to connect with ministry leaders. Staff and volunteers coordinate affordable housing advocacy, family support drives, and other partnerships that respond to the needs of North and South Bellevue residents.

Alongside its spiritual programming, the church opens its building for community events, maintains an active events calendar, and provides direct help through rides, meals, and benevolence funds when congregants face emergencies. Through these ministries, St. Peter’s serves as a trusted hub where neighbors can share resources, receive pastoral care, and work together on housing justice and social service initiatives across East King County.
