Jewish Family Service Seattle (JFS Seattle) offers a variety of services, including counseling, senior services, affordable housing support, refugee resettlement, and career-service programs primarily in the Eastside region. Their multigenerational impact—especially with elders and displaced populations—supports AEA’s mission of inclusive age-service coverage and strengthening service provider capacity.
