DESC is the region's largest multi-service agency dedicated to ending chronic homelessness. We provide permanent supportive housing combined with health services to address the complex needs of individuals facing serious mental illness, substance use disorders, and physical disabilities. Our holistic approach includes emergency shelter, crisis response, and integrated health care to support long-term stability.
