Valley Girls & Guys (VG&G) is a Maple Valley-based grassroots nonprofit that rallies the community to surround people fighting cancer. Founded by caregivers and friends, VG&G funds mammogram assistance, organizes Be the Hope XOXO Walk and blood/bone marrow drives, and deploys rapid mini-grants when neighbors need diagnostic support, transportation, or other immediate cancer-related help.

The organization’s volunteers stitch “Blankets of Comfort & Hope” personalized for anyone facing any type of cancer and ship them worldwide while keeping most deliveries local to King County. By pairing compassionate outreach with fundraising events and partnerships, VG&G keeps residents connected to early detection, treatment navigation, and tangible care packages that ease the burden of cancer for families throughout South King County and beyond.
