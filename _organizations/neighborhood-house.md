Neighborhood House (NHWA) is one of the Seattle region’s longest-running human services agencies and now assists more than 15,000 people across King County. The nonprofit connects low-income families, immigrants, and public housing residents to early learning and Head Start classrooms, after-school youth development supports, adult education and employment coaching, rent and housing stability resources, aging and disability services, and culturally responsive health and wellness programs. Through multilingual helplines, neighborhood-based community centers, and year-round outreach, Neighborhood House removes barriers so families can achieve long-term stability and thrive.
