Holy Spirit Community Pantry is a 24/7 free pantry hosted by Holy Spirit Lutheran Church in Kirkland. Neighbors are invited to take what they need and donate shelf-stable items (single-serving meals, protein snacks, water, and other ready-to-eat foods) directly at the pantry near the church’s back parking lot on 124th Street. The volunteer-led pantry focuses on mutual aid and offers contact via the church office for questions or ideas.
