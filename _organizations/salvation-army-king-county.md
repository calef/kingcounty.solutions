The Salvation Army coordinates a network of King County corps and service centers that provide meals, rent and utility support, and case-managed housing assistance from Bellevue to Renton, Kent, and Seattle. At the Community Advocacy Program on Pike Street, advocates help survivors of domestic violence and families in crisis access emergency cash, identification, and referrals, while the William Booth Center, Seattle SODO Shelter, and Adult Rehabilitation Program offer transitional beds, addiction recovery, and employment readiness.

Regional multi-service centers also operate food banks, seasonal back-to-school and holiday drives, and mobile outreach that delivers hygiene items, clothing, and pastoral care to encampments. By linking neighborhood corps, social workers, and community partners, the Salvation Army helps King County residents stabilize quickly and navigate toward permanent housing, health care, and long-term self-sufficiency.
