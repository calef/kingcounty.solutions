Rootstock Northwest is a Washington-based nonprofit that delivers weekly bags of fresh, locally grown groceries to people in need while purchasing directly from nearby farms. By pairing community donations with small-producer sourcing, it works to improve food access, reduce waste, and strengthen the regional food system. The organization invites community members to donate, apply to receive groceries, and engage in its 501(c)(3) mission (EIN: 394196137) to advance food equity.
