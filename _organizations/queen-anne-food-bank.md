Queen Anne Food Bank at Sacred Heart (QAFB) is a ministry of Sacred Heart of Jesus Parish that distributes healthy prepared meals and groceries for neighbors living in Lower Queen Anne and the surrounding downtown core. Staff and volunteers operate out of the parish campus across from Climate Pledge Arena, offering sandwiches, fruit, yogurt, bread, pastries, and hot soup Monday through Friday, 52 weeks a year.

In addition to the weekday meal line, the food bank opens its doors Thursday afternoons for a “Shop for Free” pantry so households can choose their own staples. QAFB coordinates with Catholic Community Services, parish donors, and volunteer crews to keep culturally respectful service going year-round, ensuring people experiencing homelessness or food insecurity in Seattle can connect with immediate nourishment, hygiene items, and friendly check-ins.
