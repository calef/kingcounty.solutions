The Eastside Housing Roundtable unites employers, housing developers, chambers of commerce, nonprofits, and advocates to advance coordinated affordable housing solutions across fast-growing Eastside communities. Members collaborate on evidence-based policy recommendations, align around shared housing production targets, and center equity so the benefits of the region’s growth are accessible to residents and workers at every income level.

Recent efforts include championing Bellevue’s Multifamily Tax Exemption reforms, advocating for more affordable homes in the East Main plan, backing stronger incentives for housing on faith and nonprofit-owned land, and pushing for ambitious growth targets in Bellevue and Kirkland station-area plans. By combining technical expertise with collective advocacy, EHR helps local leaders convert land-use, zoning, and revenue strategies into actionable reforms that expand housing options near transit, jobs, and services.
